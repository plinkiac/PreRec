for when the Moyer comes cuz we can only
assume at one point there will be a
mitre whoo flashlight
there's a door oh that's me peek you
can't go in you sure that's a door what
does that that looks like a door man
look at that looks like a door
all right maybe that key does something
where's another guy sergej exe has a
story about Ishtar yeah apparently his
dad was oh I got him the key oh oh nice
his dad was a chef at a popular
restaurant in New York and then when he
was working on a night while they were
filming he saw Warren Beatty and Dustin
Hoffman at a restaurant upon hearing
this I asked how were they looking and
he said not great they were drinking
pretty heavily oh the on Ishtar's
opening night okay so apparently they
knew they knew what they had done thank
you for sharing sergej exe why is this
door locked now oh I can't go in with
the tools in the door for some reason
that seemed stupid what do I need these
for Oh was there a hammer oh oh he hid
does something weird happened I wasn't
sure what was going on
did you that oh I did hear that
who was that I don't know check all your
people where's the lady she's fine
they're fine they're fine both fine
they're having some good sex you know I
mean they're still going at it well we
don't know if it's good sex it's long
sex you know like who knows if they're
both still into it at this point or if
they're just kind of getting bored
waiting for it to wrap up or something
to happen I don't know what's supposed
to happen you can't go past that thing
no okay well they probably you you got
the key from the bed so you can probably
stop having sex I got a hammer out of
the butt I met fun Oh
so coffee okay okay let him have fun
oh you're hiding in there in the
cupboard
oh oh it's morning time what in the the
other lady the non-sex lady yeah is
there like there's like a weird piece of
wood by her like what's that over there
can the guy hammer that Oh Oh sex
no oh I can use the hammer though that's
like a weapon oh great
don't hate no I'm not going to don't hit
her in the head what is that look
that's weird right but there's like not
what says oh maybe have to get across
can you hammer it oh oh the puzzle I
just did a puzzle you did a puzzle you
probably can't go in there cuz there
doesn't seem to be any sort of landing
that's one but there's an exterior door
over there why can't I get in here
oh I thought there was no landing did
you think I couldn't figure out I
thought I thought that was the bottom
you've lost your foot Oh No get it
together rich can I put it back on no
you can't put it back on I can hit
someone with my foot though the hammer
is a much better weapon is my foot you
seem to be walking just fine without it
okay head back up yeah
and there's there is it like a next yeah
okay
here we go and now you can yeah there we
go now we're puzzling now if you let go
will it go back down I guess it doesn't
matter
who's that I don't know I don't know who
wouldn't
this is this game was kind of great
what's that on the ground
oh no be the lady all right looks like a
scythe or something all right you're
done he needs to be kept naked no I
think we're done you don't want to oh my
god
you don't want dongers hanging out I'm
not really all right not really no
dongers no boobies
oh wait take your clothes off I
understand no no no okay she just wants
to throw them she doesn't want to wear
undies okay that's fine maybe it's goes
to briefs Oh naturale maybe he uh my god
maybe he is more likely to wear the
undies okay I like what what did you go
hit it hit the hammer the same button
Auto dos all right good
dongers and boobers no no dongers and
boobs okay you can ride that though
right we
why is this so great
sometimes spookiness is fun I love how
that guy's just still holding that thing
I'm gonna take your hammer
that's my hammer it's my hammer now
No hey what what hey hey now oh my lord
she's who a generator Oh what happened
you did it I did I don't know I can only
assume that's what bloodline means Lily
oh oh look there's like an eye on the
side of the thing now what happened you
were out here you tell me what happened
lady hammer and you're getting off the
bike that's dangerous
motorbike hammer it would be so easy I
mean you should probably know I gotta
try this right okay okay trying to
that's right
who is that an axe
okay okay is there something new that
needs to be cut down apparently not
Oh Oh the door the door that had the the
wood on it okay
okay the bathroom yeah yeah yeah we're
headed that way yes yes please hammer
don't hurt him nice tiberius nice Oh
fuckin rage the one-legged guy you know
he said Oh what the fuck
if so the kids a beer probably Oh
probably beer yeah oh nice
nope I mean it's gotta be something in
it like oh this is the second like music
what's that doing oh oh light switch
that's a light switch I don't know if
this poop it's probably important then
that music think that light switch I oh
my god
it was important okay well now going to
the other bathroom and turn off the
other light I can't you can't what can
you do over there just leave you
probably needed that music thing but
musically I think was the light switch
no there's like a music record that you
broke with your ax can you get in the
canoe oh oh you just broke the rope to
the canoe Ridge well I'm trying to get I
figured I'd meet two to get in the canoe
how do I get in the canoe oh why did you
just get naked is she trying to
skinny-dip oh here we go
you just jump in the water okay oh it
needs gas you had a gas can earlier no
okay I guess
Tiberius Kirk says okay you've been
bleeding a really long time now and
you're wielding an axe you may be the
serial killer and not knowing that's
very true
keep holding that thing footy people
have to get around okay can you just
keep going oh there's a rock there so
you probably can't go further than that
rock yeah yep alright so what's the
purpose of all this you didn't try going
the other way okay
Oh who's that oh I'm trying to give out
of me you probably to go to the doc but
you are skinny-dipping
I mean you're a bloody mess but you're
skinny-dipping oh there we go
there's another like Locker thing maybe
being put some put some damn clothes on
yeah don't fall off another thing how
did he get here he fell off where he was
now he's um oh wait did someone die oh
that lady died that lady died and
there's a blood trail leading to that
man must that are beardy no it goes
beyond oh my god and what leg matt has
been severely injured oh that's true oh
my god I think I think when you're not
using someone they need to hide yeah
that makes sense
oh wait is she alive now I see a corpse
can you be here she is corpse she's
corpse okay when you're not using people
you they have to hide okay they're in
the woods now Tjader 8.45 we have no
idea what's happening in the game either
so we think you know so far it's just
been basic puzzles you know like almost
almost like point-and-click adventure
but Nina inna in a 2d perspective all
right so what is doing her this is have
we done with this puzzle
oh well that maybe you turned it on
before right oh you just turned off all
the power
do you need to turn off the power I
don't know oh it's morning oh oh wait
you're stuck well no oh you have to swim
can't bring the light yes there's still
like a gas can that I'm sure is
something yeah I'm good what
nitro inferno rich and I are together I
mean we're not you know we're together
where we are in the same room
we are not skyping tonight that poor
corpse he lady you know at least she
went out fucking or you know had some
good fucking tonight now what you didn't
go out fuck oh wait there's like a zip
line look at that oh the killer the
killer rich yeah well whistling okay I'm
on a boat I go by him yeah but your
other people they're hiding are that
well go you go check on them
go check on them rich they're fine
no they're go check so what the killers
coming oh I know he is I know this but
the killer can because he's blocked Plus
what happens can the killer get through
if he can't I think I just figured out
how to solve this mystery
no he can okay
did he kill everyone they look pretty
alive I mean they looked can you switch
to them yes okay good they were hiding
ooh spooky kill earnest okay
all right so what do we do with that gas
can what is our plan what are we doing
well let's go to the drive to the other
side of the of the of the drive to the
other dock and let's just see what's
over there you never went right there is
a zip line right there so that might be
something maybe that's just like a way
to escape the killer if you're caught up
there that zip line light goes all the
way oh there's a wood chipper that looks
like a wood chipper there's a backpack
there's life jackets now and on a rock
all right back think oh so I'm in the
backpack what is that what is that I
don't know I think that's a brick
oh what's this that looks like a flare
that looks like a gun oh my god next
time you see the killer you got to shoot
him with a flare gun
oh good gasping and shoot the gas tank
there you go and then you can kill the
killer oh there he is oh he's in there
oh you put down the flare gun did I yeah
well this is please think of your foot
oh it doesn't matter
get out of there get out of there get in
the boot oh no no no no where does he go
he can't go in the water I can't get in
the boat anymore it's okay he can't go
in the water
why can't get in the boat you don't need
to get in the boat what if I need the
Pope oh it's that first be like yeah
there's like yeah over there maybe nope
all right you can't get in the boat
anymore you fucked that bridge you
probably need the boat at some point
okay the fiower you got to get that
flare gun
you seem very convinced that the flare
gun will save us it does start things on
fire next time you try shooting the bad
guy with the flare gun oh the bad guy
could be anywhere rich what was that Oh
run away Oh oh you're out of flares you
you son of a bitch rich this right you
know I'm gonna say there's multiple ways
to do this we just don't know them you
didn't turn on the wood chipper nope oh
I was gonna pick something up and try
and throw it right oh oh that's okay you
have two people left you have two people
left I don't know what I'm doing you
have to we have to kill this guy some
hobby so you have to kill him
I don't know if turning out the lights
will help anything well I don't know if
anything will help anything man Touche
what is that oh no did you just die yes
well you have a scythe now we have a
bloody nude woman with a scythe but
she's your best hope he's not he how did
he start on fire that's a very good
question that I don't know the answer to
how the fucking hell did he start on
fire
she is the virgin well no she was she
had a clothes on top of a guy well no
she was like humping the lady's face so
she could probably still be a virgin you
know Sheree she was fully clothed on top
of one guy and then humping a lady's
face I'm gonna say virgin I know what
I'm gonna try I don't know that it's
gonna work okay what are you gonna try
what's the plan what's the game plan oh
oh he lost his ax oh you can totally
fuckin site this shit out of him now
it was on fire there doesn't matter yeah
because you could probably pick it up
and throw it out of
oh my god Richard what what is your plan
I am so scared right now
did he see you I don't know I don't know
oh good okay what's your plan this house
pokey are you gonna zip line and hit him
in the face
no no okay oh I know what you're gonna
do
yeah that's a good plan do you think
it's gonna work I have no idea jack okay
great this is a quality plan okay nice
okay okay be very shut up we need to
make some noise to lure him over here
wait wait no it this is this is a serial
killer we have to make sex noises okay
okay okay we need to have a talk about
okay Shh baby bitch Oh who's that
all right oh you'll have to kill had
enough you have to kill him multiple
ways but he dropped his axe again all
right what do we do next what do we do
next
I think we got a zipline him into the
wood chipper Oh what is that another
killer who is that that's a boy a body
is just a dummy P what the fuck who's in
what do we got
music why is music important any
I'm sure oh oh you have a gun I think
that's gonna help
I'm just gonna put put this out there I
really think that's gonna help I kind of
adore this jack yeah yeah okay oh oh
shit you don't have any bullets she
don't have any board oh shit yeah count
Oh son of a bitch where the bullets how
the fuck should I know
throw that fire thing at him Oh where'd
he go
how do we get him in the wood chipper I
think we got a zip line them your zip
one theory is weird
yes yes sir they don't like it it's it's
silly it's well it's dope you're just
okay he doesn't he didn't see you you
need to find some bullets were the
bullets that um maybe that white thing
that was in the backpack that package of
white thing yeah all those white bullets
you know could be a box of bullets I
don't know
we phone upstairs right maybe maybe no
no don't go I remember fall down you
fall down and lose a leg lose a foot leg
oh oh you can hit him with the motorbike
not enough okay so no it's not Oh axe
axe um oh no oh no that's his ex I guess
he has special power over that axe
oh that is just not a good hiding spot
it's all I got
oh shit he's ami yeah well it's not a
very good hiding spot he can't swim you
say you got that going for you he can
definitely see you in there though
people are telling me I just missed oh
that could be swung too late or too
early or something killem Canadian style
with love I don't think that's gonna
work there is a flaming thing I think
you could throw that at him that thing
is still on fire and I think that's your
best your best last hope
oh yeah you can get in the boat now
that's great oh don't always be
dignified you know oh you know what that
looks like that looks like a sock oh no
no it has a funk to it a metal funk
maybe that looks like that could be a
box of bullets I don't think so pick up
that thing I'm fired
I burned to death
oh I think that's maybe a /kup it's on
fire it's damaged okay that could be a
box of bullets I die I do you know I
have nothing indicating that you don't
think no okay
you can't get away on the boat there are
rocks there are rocks on either side now
pick up the fuck she's gotta go
searching oh we got this dead end okay
okay what rooms what is the thing on the
outside of this building by the right
window what is that oh it's a rocking
chair
get this fucking whoo I've stopped
regular confident I just don't think
that's good
mm-hmm Oh maybe I'll pick up that
backpack and throw it didn't something
come out of that last backpack as our 42
if we could rock him like a hurricane we
would he doesn't seem like the kind that
is rocked by hurricanes I mean there's a
zip line there rich how do you how would
you time it I don't know and you keep
bringing it up like it's this magic
bullet it's it's there you know like I'm
using my video game brain and say
there's a thing that's here the lantern
through our Lantern Adam yeah it's not
work I don't yeah oh we can throw things
in the wood chipper you could throw
their bodies in a wood chipper oh maybe
you have to like knock him down and then
throw his body in the wood chipper you
know this is I'm just no they don't
how do I even know it's a zipline at the
top of it has a thing that looks like
you can dangle weights or doors open
what that door is open that has been
open that has been open that I get blown
open I think that got blown open
if Ricky ever goes over there again I'll
show you there's a little dangle hold on
no no I'm not saying you have to just
whenever what is in that door you know
we're gonna solve this with the zipline
mister once for all the great supply
mystery that looks like a zipline to me
you might be right
how do you okay and so then my guess is
you'd oh oh it made a thing fall off
they made the weather vane fall off dear
booyah the answer is always zipline so
what is the weather vane do nothing
nothing I can't oh you know what it
would have fallen on him I bet all right
well that was well that was waste can
you pick that thing up no no try again
No
okay abz always be zipline oh oh
zipline twice saved twice all I'm saying
so next throw a thing on fire Adam you
don't think okay throw a dead guy at him
are supplying our OD mulcher is dead I
bet he turned off the power because the
light switch wasn't working either I
think I turns off Oh or you might have
turned it off oh okay
smokiness spookiness
didn't you can do a rich oh I think I
just Oh what what what what I think he
just uh no I did Oh yep he did so I
think when you go when he went past that
winch I'm a little big bling-bling hurt
you know and so I think maybe that's how
you can zipline him into the wood
chipper as he hear that Dingle Dingle
and then you and then you go he saw you
there last time he's walking slow
flashlight in the lake
zip lines did work for Kevin McCallister
that's true so you know you wait he
walks that way you hear the jingle
jingle zip while maybe none single
jingles the faraway wood chipper okay
nevermind all right yep never mind
that was a stretch where's that wood
chipper
I think we've usually wasted a lot of
our opportunities to kill him I think
that could be I think we've just fucked
up royally
there there has to be a oh you know what
is that a knife might be can you swing
that I can throw it
it made a metal clunks oh okay okay that
got him
I can throw it throw the fun thing I
fire at him I can't you can't throw it
no this is light oh I think you were
peeing in your pants that whole time is
that little droplets of blood yeah I
think so yeah we need a solution this is
starting to get old
you either oh there's a key there's that
key what do you want this is I'm just
telling you the things I see in case
they help you okay that's fair that's
fair all that time wasted on the cabin
foursome you say wasted I say we made
these people live their lives to the
fullest how's that I'm ash oh you have a
book of matches right now Oh where's the
gas can we blow up
oh that's right nothing yeah you really
need my god MC Lucas has a great idea
shit you see that yep I'm see Lucas we
are trying that next where's the I
haven't seen the brake in a while oh you
haven't tripped over the rain it might
even blown up
what else what else was the chat god I
like that the rake into the wood chipper
that's a good idea
can you be naked and seduce him with
your feminine wiles no I cannot now okay
didn't have that oh they're saying yeah
the rake blew up am I am I out of things
are we doomed
yeah the Rick's wood chippers I got a
gas to wood chippers dead oh my god we
are are we out of things we might be out
of things did we just fuck up
hey that's possible I wonder with I
wonder how many things you have to hit
him with do you have to hit him with all
the things I don't know oh oh there's a
box you can throw at him
you your dog and your friends are dead
Oh jack yes well now that I know I know
huddle okay game over
Oh Oh like you Kevin three oh yeah this
was we start with me
so we're gonna do with the beer cans
drink I wonder if that gives you health
it's gonna make me drunk oh yeah look at
the letters you're saying to set up
traps well it's laid out well you know
what to do with that how do you angle
the rig so falling in a bowl what you
fall under the wood chipper wait I can't
be that guy anymore cuz he's drunk how
do you be different people like that
guys drunk
those are the matches Oh
sunglasses oh that's a bong
X uses the thing are those just matches
yeah I think those are matches yeah that
looks like a box of matches oh yeah I'm
getting I'm oh oh oh what do you think
that is
Oh Sookie nee will just say just because
it sounds funny I'm sure you know oh
don't oh alors alright I got this this
is this is a neat game you know what
this is oh I dude this is a neat game
alright alright miss oh wait well that's
right we need the hammer Oh what are
those in the floor is that the board
what's that that's a five sight oh yeah
where did we find that hammer well you
needed a key oh that's right okay way to
get in the door you got the key it's
right there run Oh someone's gonna die
there's nothing you can do have her run
shit he's doomed yep he's doomed okay
well then we can hide and you can run Oh
pick them up Bowman to think okay
handsome handsome excellent
well I pressed the wrong button I
pressed the wrong yes I know you did but
I hide I hid all the drunk I owe the
rinks busted now it's probably facing
the wrong way it's witches damn it damn
it damn it
no the rake is bust Oh No
just throw something at that ladies how
you doing good hiding behind a tree
I practice can't leave them in the lake
right like I probably doesn't work it
might drown after a while yeah I can
only assume you're already down to
people too yeah like one girl is dead oh
that's right oh shit okay so I only have
two to deal with okay so we have a gas
can yep this guy should not have had so
much beer and here's some matches oh
there's the gas tank great
can you pour the gas on the ground like
what happens leave there happens any
headaches it just throws
oh there's oil and there's gas in the
ground so you could don't waste it
that was well I would thought I could be
fast enough what what the fuck was that
I thought your matches are wet you just
lost the matches what you just lost the
matches there's more matches it's okay
there's more matches alien isolation
alienation but in 2d you have more
options than this than you didn't alien
invasion this traps do you notice how
we're playing the game it's it's not
linear right you're not walking to the
next thing you're supposed to walk to to
hit the next button that's the button
you're supposed to hit next
what's brewing how's that other girl
doing I assume she's still hiding but I
have no idea
switched over quick yeah she's like hi
where's this fucker I got a knife
there's another thing of matches oh oh
he already broke through this thing
I lost bad no no can you hide behind one
of those trees he started a lot quicker
with you well they probably know
broken rake probably not gonna do much
wait what's be over the Ellison's hide
then and why is the axe on his head is
the act he's the axe balance murderer
right you glitched him earlier
oh that's why I haven't yet well I threw
a knife at him so that slowed him down a
little bit I need to find there's
another book of matches this flare gun I
don't know there is another book of
matches well there's a flare gun then
the zipline with the thing and there's
the zip line with the thing yep and
there's the motorbike still I can hit
him with the motorbike okay let's see
the motorbike it was over here somewhere
there it is did you have to jump off or
you just crashed into it I think I just
crashed into him okay okay I'm gonna do
that that's my next play I'm gonna crash
into him oh fuck he turned off the
lights okay here we go
got this thing - I'll do a lot of good
that box whatever it is nitro inferno
says I'm not a fan of this water retreat
strategy and I'm kind of with you on
that I'm kind of with you oh god what
the fuck young somebody up like a
scarecrow no Jack I'm so sorry well
listen I'm not a big fan of the water
retreat strategy either but you know you
do it works I suppose you could set
limits on yourself once you're better at
the game sure up fuck you oh no I had to
or else I'd die damn it well that ruined
Bank probably would love this game he
should come around to streams more often
I said I'm just gonna drink more just
gonna drink yourself to death that's my
plan
it's actually really hard to play the
game like this because it's all wobbly
yeah so you know this is how do I open
that thing I guess I'll just have
another beer we might have used the axe
when I did it where's the series like
matches I have a thing of matches come
on over here serial killer
I think you've blown up all of the gas
no but there was a there was a puddle
still right yeah over here
oh no there you go Oh dumb serial killer
well I set him on fire I did didn't did
he see me oh hey I'm burn another
campfire
no what fire that is get up huh oh my
god no he's just gonna get up again and
burn on the campfire again
this is kinda this is what I call a
super week strategy yeah it didn't seem
to do much damage to him though right
nope hide let him walk past a site
there's a site over here okay oh I miss
them I'm not gonna cite the strategy
again I got a run I got a run to get to
that bike but it takes a couple pumps to
get started okay here we go
here we go
but I've killed yourself Oh No

[Part II]
bring us home rich alright you can do
this so what are those I don't know what
those that white box is it's just done
this is just done now what okay there's
two things in there yeah get everyone
else to hide yeah right away where's the
bed we get the key gotta fuck real quick
yeah real quick real quick okay run

lady yeah i know i'm trying to get
bhangra okay get the key okay okay your
modesty back you two daughters okay hi

I think once that I think the dog is the
first thing to die okay what is the key
open again what's this oh oh oh that
might have been the dog dying was that
the dog dying I don't know jack
what's this that's a radio I guess
that's like a Laura could be oh shit
what's this this I guess they're in an
inventory now okay that's the thing you
could throw at them
can you bring that outside I think I
need to find a way to open that the
hammer the axe yeah yeah
first things first first things first
first things first what are we doing
first I wonder if one of those things
with shotgun shells it could be I heard
a cop that time they caught the other
times it did it did cock the other times
oh no the dogs still alive
so I went that thing is up you need a
hammer toolbox hammer in the toolbox
what is that hey push a paintbrush weird
alright well you got the hammer
I do enjoy how like the puzzle for
things is just like I throw it against
the shit I mean that's great this is the
fault oh yeah oh yeah that's the fall
dart alright okay what else so we need
the hammer for Oh we're gonna try to
open that crate with the hammer but
we're getting tonight one already
those are the shotgun shells right oh go
get your shotgun those are definitely
shotgun all right okay okay okay
we got pro-gaming here jack you roll yes
these no not there
down the other dark down there probably
that's right
okay now see how many those shells you
can get in there then you can really
fuck some people up watch me literally
this is programming it is what Oh on the
downstairs but you gotta be yeah there's
a murderer coming yeah yeah shotgun
but it does everything no no take a nap
Oh flares flares nice nice okay you go
only get one bullet I guess but that's
something that's fine let's understand
there's it where's your other everyone
else is hiding okay
and there's your dog I can only assume
your dog is the first to get killed
all right now I got a way through that
door why don't you crank up the why do
you have him crank up the thing
crank up one thing the caring kept that
thing that you can crank up and drop on
the guy cuz last time the guy just broke
through it multiple things we have to do
okay
Oh Frank that was the first money did my
rate move
perfect oh my god what are you doing
rich situating it right there I gotta
he's gonna fall the right way Hersman
useless no here I think you only get so
got it's got to follow the other way
alright alright there you just yeah you
had it yeah they go don't don't touch it
by your jerk yeah and I have lady pants
crank up the thing to drop on the guy I
wonder you know like the the real
question is how many things do you need
to hit him with I don't know
okay alright no what is he gonna do it's
fun to guess gas was in the second gas
trap yeah let's let's set the gas trap
and I think you need to set the gas trap
like in the middle I had it too close to
the I had the gas trap too close to the
water I think oh oh
the I he is not oh there's an axe
where was the oh the flare gun I need
the flare gun Oh go get the axe
you need the X to get the playground
nice okay okay we got this we got this
nobody dies this will be the latest in
slasher movie
Oh button also there's a rake you're
gonna fall into the right oh you know
yeah okay thanks got the flare gun
fuck that's fine did you drop the flare
gun
yes I did you dog still around I wonder
if it's random like when he comes around
he came around like the first day I know
right I know you got unlucky or maybe we
just did a thing that triggered him we
don't know what that thing is yet poor
lady no well we triggered the eyeball
I'm using an estate here
where are you killer man right where are
you oh maybe ring the bell
Oh crows that might be the signal oh
sure sure
could be I hear doors nice nice that's
okay
oh now maybe switch to the lady he's
gonna burn for a little bit oh the dogs
on your hair you dog is an acceptable
sacrifice rich crows are the signal okay
Thank You dick neutral
okay now maybe I'm go switch to the lady
and drop the thing on him real quick
he needs a hiding spot I can't just I
was sure do this all willy-nilly Jack I
know don't let him get the ax
yeah what was in here just the music
there's a teddy bear up there waiting
waiting yeah you need to you need to
lure him
oh so much that radio fucking
oh shit
Lucas uno open
you're gonna sacrifice mustache oh yeah
someone else can do it
oh maybe get up on the zip line and you
can don't be shy damn it no oh yeah hide
under the bed they go oh son of a bitch
this sucks
oh the shotgun has a bullet it yeah okay
okay well you're down one you still have
three more people you should still be in
there right
you would die you know I don't know what
the rules of the game are ooh
blood-trail you're right oh oh he's up
to thought he's up on top they said that
your blood trail gave you away
oh I guess that makes sense oh I'm a
dead end there
why don't we any other side shit
wait no no not that way oh shit
ask him all right you got this you got
this nice I think you only have one
bullet sacrifice oh not even a sacrifice
but he's not dead yet
he's not he's hobbling on one foot oh
now he's nice and slow oh nice both of
you are hopping on one foot this is such
a horror movie do you think you can axe
an hour
no that's Reiki yes I know it is oh wait
from the trip on it yeah and then axes
fucker okay
where is he oh oh no what nope nope
oh my god this is insane is this fast as
I can go you can uh you can like double
back through that area oh my god nope
that's okay
you have to left right to left and he is
very badly hurt
yeah that area you can kind of like go
in one door and out the other and kind
of get behind him
did hitting on with that axe do nothing
yeah I think he you either missed again
or like you just can't hit him with the
axe maybe what is that uh that looks
like a paint can there's a knife you can
throw at him and we still have two
things we can drop on him nice
oh that's slowed him down a lot
she's not taking her shit nope
I don't think you guys get him drunk oh
yeah nice the old double back for a can
of beer Adam
what'd you just drink it though I can't
throw it oh that's right that's right
now this gets you drunk you need to
raise up that thing oh yeah go in that
door
yeah
nope that's my yeah you have plenty of
time I think you got to be quick on this
one I think you have to like raise up
the thing and then lure him with the
other lady and then drop it on him or
else he's gonna go in there well I don't
know I made my that nice
get the flag out of there
now there's no hiding places over there
did you know he's not no but now do you
need to like do something with his
corpse yeah hey what if we drop that
hammer so many things
oh no maybe we just find a hiding who
the fuck is that it's a second murderer
there's a second murder there's the
second murder what
Oh No
get on there lady we have to kill two
it's just not gonna happen it's not
gonna happen it's not gonna happen
yeah I missed the axe I was going for
the axe oh my god this is great this
this understands slasher movies yes this
does understand slasher movies I wish I
just wonder though if you need to be
100% in order to beat the game I have no
idea and that would suck
that's not a bad idea the first killer
you might want to throw his corpse in
the wood chipper really yeah oh he's
fast this is the only thing I can think
yep wow wow wow wow I don't know can
this be done can this be done you your
dog and your friends are dead okay it's
not helping anybody that backpack that
just gets me naked I can throw that I
need an axe does get you a knife I'm
sure there's something useful on the
backpack huh but I already got that now
do ya efficiency is the key that's kind
of bad if you have no leeway
oh he's hiding behind the cabinet do you
start directly do you see him I do oh I
wonder that's great I wonder if he
always started right there
it's really funny okay II and then this
lady pants B to make it pants fucker
pants all done
no wait what did that unlock but I just
went into my inventory yeah oh no oh no
that got the underpants no yeah no yeah
it's in your inventory go to that one
door I swear to god it'll open wait wait
what are you doing with the end of work
I don't know what's wrong with you many
things okay
no not that not that one I know they're
saying she's a boy we had her naked she
seemed like a sheep the one with the
boobs okay I'm moving I'm moving she's
got the key and the key gets us protip
if the first murderer picks up the teddy
bear in the bathroom he won't hurt you
all right that seems silly leave that
down by the crate because we know the
bullets are in the crate
are you talking about sleepaway camp
yeah okay okay
I remember sleep waking Oh killer okay
just killin doesn't killer does not
appear until you go to the cabin on the
left has not appeared
yeah I understand sleepaway camp I just
don't understand why anybody would go
out of their way to reference it might
fix the board's oh right there move move
lady move it's saying he doesn't appear
to go The Last House in the left mm-hmm
I'm getting all set up over here
I'm just moving everything to the
outside Claire that's weird
I can change the day on the calendar
this is it Friday the 13th
oh wait is read it does stop on the 13th
but did you notice that I did notice
that a v8 was read that's the thing I
don't know what thing that is but it's a
thing all right that has shotgun shells
in it now don't leave it around what if
he can pick that up
he picks up these weapons you've noticed
right no he's just has an axe no no
that's the X that we get he picks it up
he had the hammer one time did he yeah
all right come on dongers we got this we
totally got this he's too good for
clothes
yeah he's natural wait I heard a door
open
you have to have three of your people
beat him to death
hide the dog somewhere can you hide the
dog look we don't know anything about
this game I hadn't even heard of this
until like 10 minutes before we started
the stream
are you trying to accent oh yeah man try
to hide the dog oh how do you hide your
dog just throw them well there's a car
behind the tree you can get into it's a
car behind the tree I just read things
okay okay regular James it did the
trailer for this game that's true I
think that's how I heard of it okay
that's great yeah I still haven't
loosened the flare gun the WASC
you're right oh there the crows there's
a rail gun on top of the big house that
you can rocket jump to did you just
waste a shotgun - Louie I absolutely did
well we're doing kind of we're kind of
doomed can I hit him just hit him with
the axe yeah I'm good so far we have not
been able to hit it just hit him with
the axe
yeah you keep trying now you have her
yay hit him with a hammer Jack oh no
nope nope nope nope
I think it's on the wrong side but turn
it on okay oh I can't you turn the power
off
I was hoping if I moved it he would like
oh no you okay you cannot hit him like
this you cannot just like take a wider
hips it's the power of my nudity I don't
know what you can do with the boat I
think it's just like a way to get around
faster if you employ this week a
strategy no um I wonder if we can Oh
into the boat if you put the thing on
fire yeah he runs off he runs off the
dock and then you can hit him with the
boat that makes sense
maybe the boat will explode if it's on
fire because of the the motorboat sure
so we have to free the boat position it
correctly but then again we still gotta
have enough shit left over to kill the
other guy right this is bullshit it's
might be a little bullshit
is he wearing clown makeup what Oh Jack
I still got him Oh is he crying like a
baby yeah he's like a baby I think
that's why they say we need to give him
the Tabor oh I get it
there's a book there huh there's no boat
there for our does he go a little bit
far enough help
okay
no later you don't want the Fleur gun
unless you just want to burn to death
with him I think I can throw the flare
it's not gonna go into the boat missed
the boat stop position right oh there's
a gas camera but I mean if we're trying
the boat trap they're not sit up and you
killed the girl
good oh I don't think that does anything
it does not
it surely does not
Oh not enough speed not enough speed so
what is that thing what can I do because
the Friday the 13th okay I don't know oh
is that what's his face is is that his
burnt skeleton like move there is that
what that's supposed to be oh maybe I
don't know
right the question is can I do this fast
enough not if he's coming I need I need
him over on this side you know
and hide switch to him
I don't think I have enough time yeah
yep yep no no I did huh
you did and I was gonna call up the door
and you're gonna be what are you doing
what do you need I'm fine so now wait
what is that
what does that jar of something up here
I need him to come from this side so I
can like time it right you know come on
you dickhead where are you where are you
the melee weapons work unless you're too
close
unless you're too close
Bell summons the killer immediately he
if he hasn't spawned yet okay oh oh you
just went inside that building
you see when he comes out wait for the
building
I need this lady as bait so you can put
it on the wrong side of oh my god oh
that's the dog what are you doing I
don't want it I don't want the killer to
go inside the building you know and so
I'm going to use the lady to chase him
over here then switch it to the man she
needs to be hidden before he did not
have that cover
son of a bitch rich and here's the thing
like I'm gonna do all this and it won't
matter because that second killer is
gonna come
I'm totally boned I've moved I've ruined
all my opportunities and makeup on
sorry oh I know I'm so boned we need to
get him into the wood chipper right I
want to go with this stuffed animal
theory we gonna find out how to get that
bear I gotta find out how to get that
bear down yeah oh don't worry that'll be
a highlight I think yeah look he's like
that guys all pinned up on the tree nope
damn it
I think the real objective here is to
get him into the yep no oh that's me
that's my fault
no no too early no no but uh else is too
late okay so you're gonna try to figure
out that teddy bear suit yeah and let's
find out the teddy bear situation what
why don't you jump in the water
schmuck schmuck I'm schmuck smacking
ttan smacking to you from the schmuck
Factory English much much much much much
much a ghulam oh look at that guy he's
hiding behind there that's funny I
wonder if he was always hiding best
foreshadowing yeah that's a great for
show that's the guy that popped up in
the foreground earlier right put the
underwear on the dog I don't all right
so we know what to get in this room we
don't know how to get the bear down we
don't know how to get the bear down
let's see if we can figure this out okay
what are the tools at our disposal we
know we have an axe and we have a hammer
like in in my thoughts is like the is
that the wood chipper would be an
insta-kill right I don't know if that
was that's true or not but anything if
the killer hits the rake that that's one
use rake for the killer Oh does she have
oh is that a little peepee is that a
sleepaway camp reference could be a
pee-pee see what it's sent a dude in I
mean we're on our way yeah that dude
likes a little I likes a little we we
honest at his Fifi no I'm saying I'm a
female
ah they kept me up the but good bit but
it's hard because like you know it's
hard to tell because the shadow of their
leg I don't know if that is a penis and
actually isn't that sleepaway camp to
where the killer is a boy not sleepaway
camp one if that was the same killer and
all I haven't really heard about them I
haven't really seen him I'm not a huge
horror movie right oh right my mother
was I remember seeing sleepaway camp too
far too young far far too young no Doug
you got the dog we already put doomed
world literally the first thing we ever
did in the game was get the four of them
in bed together that was just the very
first thing we did you late to the party
and that's on you
yep yep okay spoilers you know what I'm
gonna go ahead and not care about
spoilers for sleepaway camp and
sleepaway camp - you know that's well
past the moratorium for spoilers okay
good now you got the shells
I guess maybe if you just hammer the
wall in the bathroom maybe is that your
plan everybody's hiding behind tree yeah
yeah really
you have to like nice okay oh that it's
the bathroom was in here
reset the other one it's in there can
you hammer those things down I don't
think so no okay
drop the hammer drop the hammer this
place I could put him where he wants I
can
welcome to the river with it it might
Nina do you know yeah leave the hammer
in there well hope he searches
everywhere I think probably so he'll
probably still find the hammer sooner or
later I think him having a weapon is
irrelevant you can pick it yeah that's
right I had the hammer in my hand the
first time for what when I tried to walk
across okay I'm with you I'm with you
all right so the axe was way on the box
the axe is way on the dock the axes on
the time yeah I thought they you already
have the hammer no the other way other
doc oh so we got to get that door open
okay so yeah we you have to you have to
send someone to open up the thing nope
yep nothing too unusual just er
desiccated corpse I don't think that's
supposed to be a corpse I don't know
what that's supposed to be
I had to bullet now getting our ducks in
a row
yep hmm all right so we need two people
to get through you know what leftover
beefcake I don't I I don't believe there
are any spikes we have not run into any
spikes in this game yet we've run into a
knife and there are spike like things on
the rake nope nope don't drop it like
that drive like that
there yeah so that's sight you trip on
yeah so no matter what way it's facing
no no you know what
when I had it like that and the killer
came from the left he tripped left okay
so yeah like that
oh no that don't work you need to you
need to go off on the flat end yeah now
go left but that'll trip that that way
trips into the device yes you have it
placed correctly no now you don't have a
plane can you hide anyone who I mean
what I'm thinking about later is there a
hiding spot the rake does technically
have spikes but that's more of a rake no
you're gonna trip over it and it's not
face the right direction there you go
now you're good yeah yeah okay
yes it's a little bit of home alone
meets Friday the 13th I think that's
exactly what this game is is the two NES
classics home alone and Friday and 13
meshed into one beautiful game now don't
go into that last cabinet right that's
the yep that's the trigger canyon cabin
the trigger canyon what we've heard that
makes sense your dog is still alive
what's that spikes are gay code I knew
it I knew it I know that's false
what oh is that blood as that just
leaves it could be either way now go
into the water closet the water closet
which one is the water closet no go
right it has a WC on it oh okay what did
you use hammer I have a music thing oh
sure which may have been a mistake I
think now now I try hammering the walls
this is right okay
it's the only thing I can think of is
the chat now I'm open dude what happens
with the rake can you use the rake no
huh
we can only drop the rake rake doesn't
do anything if you exit no what do we do
chat what do we do how do we get that
fucking how do we get that bad here you
know what fuck the bear fuck it oh it
says use the potty use the potty in
there alright alright huh I think we've
done that before haven't we use the
other potty
no I guess we did oh my god oh that is
so dumb well so now if he gets the bear
what'll happen Jay

[Part III]
jay-j Bowman come in come in I saw a
little bit of what you're playing it
looks amazing is that why you rushed
over here it is rather amazing yeah it's
exactly the game remember playing the
Friday the 13th game yeah it's exactly
no no don't break it I'm not trying to
break it dad to hit him with no I think
you just need to get it in his path give
him the teddy bear and then get
everything else set up for the other
killer it's a very pretty game would you
would you like to play I'm not averse to
just want to watch you play would you
like a chair in a microphone okay a
chair and a microt by the way to start
the motorboat you have to hit X like
multiple times it'll just like a false
don't know why let's see if the info
glare is still bad maybe I can deal with
it you want sunlight on you're a lot
less dense
okay I hope that's not too far out
you said about where it landed where you
landed do you remember you wanted the
boat yeah then we're gonna set the boat
on fire like a like a Viking funeral I
don't think that one how do you know I
think you run into him with the boat oh
maybe maybe I'm not around yet so we're
fine wonder what I can do with the
scythe beep beep alright that's setup we
got a teddy bear I don't know if I have
to hit him with the teddy bear yeah and
I'm not sure
Oh where's my flare gun that I grabbed
us did you grab the flare gun I freed it
I don't okay
I didn't realize you're gonna be doing
spooky games at the start of October now
that you're just gonna do like a
designated Halloween Street that's great
it's October J I I'm fine with that it's
my thang khuu it's in the Halloween
spirit it is the today's now of
spooktacular
we just we felt like planning integrity
acted I wasn't even really familiar wow
it looks great
so where's where's that fuel canister
okay I'm missing or is that no oh that's
in the one building that's in this
billing all right what is the name of
this game okay he's got the shotgun
she's got the door he's by the teddy
bear
so you can switch out between carrots
yeah yeah just instantly although this
slasher built on victims yep yeah you've
got a lot of victims so far have had
much success the chat has been helping
us crack the code says it like you have
to do a series of things in a certain
order - yes number of different things
you can do Oh is there like a backstory
to the slasher not that it probably is
there's not one that I'm familiar with
cuz that's the only way to know a good
slasher movie from a bad slasher movie
is the the background of the slashers if
they're all the same thing he appears to
be like like baby kind of childish
themed okay all right we're gonna we're
gonna start this bitch up
this is the cabin that supposedly
triggers him right yeah all right didn't
do it
you mean you there's like an eye that
comes on the cabin right no I don't know
everything jack I know I know many
things but I don't know them all right
what are we missing
why isn't this starting yeah oh wait hit
the other if the X closer to the wall
and that turns the power off yeah yeah
I'll turn it back on wait I thought we
want it off well you want it on
eventually right Oh ring the oh you can
also ring the bell to summon the killer
all right all right
missile we power on them yeah oh yeah
you need the power
exactly who wants what dick neutral
James did would like to know if he can
get a quote from you for the next
installment of the game absolutely James
ed are you in the chat no the guy who
make this game Z in the chat he didn't
make the game he did the trailer for the
game I went by the Bell I went by the
Bell you went past well well past it all
because it's dark and I didn't see the
Bell I love the lighting when it's
nighttime this is so great so I don't
know if I'm hitting him with the barrel
or what am i doing with the burp I think
he just has to pick up the bear James it
is in the chat oh hi James
welcome to the jet where his scythe on
he's got the same does he have this
Authority does that mean he can't oh he
has to not have the bear tip you if you
let him pick it up if he doesn't already
have a weapon he will carry it and not
hurt
well now we know laughs and that's like
a third of the bat oh shit oh wait he
has the bear he has the bear now he
can't hurt you oh no oh cuz he has the
bear we've discovered earlier if your
characters really hurt and the killer
gets very close to you you pee in your
pants no we lost what's-her-face oh my
god oh yeah face how do you know when
you lose someone she's right there oh oh
there's the flare gun - where was it
it's it's empty no it's not empty
I fucked up already it I thought it was
empty it's black it's normally red I
thought black men it was empty
that's fine it's fine we're all gonna be
fine everything's fine it's gonna be
fine now cuz he has to bear you have to
get her into the wood chipper that's an
insta-kill well I gotta wait for this
fire to die was it him you can't do it
it cries then that's that yeah Oh what
just happened oh my god what was that
what happened I hear everything just
exploded what happened I don't know
buddy kill them I guess I don't know
what happened all the information for
nothing for nothing
buttermilk biscuits I have nothing to
face the wood chipper being an
insta-kill on but it's a wood chisel
wood chipper oh shit I'm dead were dead
we're dead fuck it we're dead fuck it
what did that he did do it again your
dog alright is that a reference to the
Friday the 13th game why isn't that the
end title like you and all your friends
are dead I want to say that thumbs up at
the when you die I think so yeah game
and you do have a little dog in here
he's right there
oh I need to figure out what that is
that white thing I have no idea what
yeah that's curating me because it's
probably something we can do with that
oh of course that is a knife apparently
we thought it was a sock it looks like a
sari looks like a tube sock it's a knife
yeah and that's why they will trim into
the wood chipper but I got to be on the
other side rum is if it comes from this
I need to be on the other side to
activate the wood chipper yes
so here's here's the here's what you do
if like if the chat says that the wood
chipper is not an insta-kill which I
would assume it is an insta-kill
you have to time that with your zipline
so use your zipline oh my god in that
and then you'll zipline right over that
and get on that I don't want the wood
chipper running early because it'll run
out of gas what's happened before is
that the power was like a power I think
that's the power turn on and let it run
yeah he has a good long trip
I've seen him trip on did you just move
in my room oh I've never seen him do
that before
you know the the rake has been nothing
but trouble but I feel like it's worth
the trouble if it is indeed an
insta-kill which I can only assume it is
all right we're gonna go for that dead
teddy bear teddy bear Jay did you see
this part what part also be magical if
you don't know what happens I don't know
no it's just the goodness it has the
purpose that's great the very first
thing we did in the game was get all
four of them oh they do that everybody
goes yes everybody
don't tell don't tell Jack he's wrong
about the insta-kill wood chipper well
it's a wood chipper what do you want
Jack what do you want what what do you
what do you want out of me how are you
out of everybody hey it's not an
insta-kill what can we do what is that I
don't know find new things I wouldn't be
doing random things oh yeah what Oh get
the shotgun
Michelle with the hammer hit start
research started oh wait there's all
sorts of stuff yeah yeah
are there other levels are these like
other things you've picked up in the
game oh there might be yeah I did find a
piece of paper once leave check oh yeah
we could probably go to like chapter 4
all right all right I don't know if we
have to like finish this first do we
want to try this one more time oh yeah
we listen we have all the things now so
we should we should try to finish this I
believe there is there's also like view
cabin for you know but we're in the flow
here sure can you not play one or two
you can ah we haven't found how to play
one or two now okay it's quite possibly
do we know if there exists if they exist
in ours just like a thing nice just the
sequel's I would assume it's only effect
cuz that that's funny yeah alright
see she looks like she has a dog or two
I don't think that the brown haired lady
has a dog we there was speculation on
whether or not there was a fuck yeah oh
there's speculation on mother now there
was a sleepaway camp reference oh okay
see spoilers for sleepaway camp she wait
look they're just scissoring it kind of
looks like she has a daughter but that
could just be a leg shit is just pixels
no no no there's some differences yeah
that's a sleepaway camp reference if so
that's great
sleepaway camp hey you do the same thing
yeah that movies so fucking weird I've
only seen sleepaway camp - oh it's
nothing like the firt the first one is
like so much of it just feels like the
most generic slasher ever but it has all
these weird little details and weird
moments and then of course everybody
knows the ending yeah but uh yeah just
lots of weird touch isn't it mm the
second and third or more just like
horror comedies starring Bruce
Springsteen sister like the killer in
those movies yeah and then a third one
yeah all right all right now I need to
only hit that box once yep and then you
need to go get now you need to go and
raise up the thing and get the ax to get
the flare gun
okay you should track down for some time
this month one of the Evil Dead games oh
I don't know how many there are
oh that's that's that's a plan that's
definitely a plan I've got one oh yeah
yeah you have boomstick right um I am
the one with Ted Raimi as the side is a
midget sidekick is the undead midget
sidekick how many Evil Dead games are
there a bunch hail to the king
Fistful of boomstick and regeneration
that's the one I have regeneration they
all take place after army of Darkness I
think I don't know that they're related
continuity wise even okay well they
don't care about continuity for a movie
to me I would take care of it yeah I
like regeneration
I like along with Ted Raimi is a good
comic interaction between them
we could play 1:1 I mean we can grab a
fistful of boomstick I think I actually
you know I might even have Fistful of
lipstick - I might a bowl
I don't remember what what I've rented
what I've actually played these things
have all become blurred in my life and
one of these days to make our
spooktacular spook of lloween scooch
over
complete I do want want to do another
board game man where we play that house
on Haunted Hill game oh it's a really
fun horror like based on the movie not
based on movies it's basically just like
a haunted house game and it's a really
neat board game yeah our weed ditching
the scythe and the like so he can't get
the scythe is there anything we can do
with the scythe we haven't had any luck
with the male life no no yeah ditch the
scythe okay do it
we had complicated feelings about soma I
wish someone were a game I absolutely
fucking love the story fucking fucking
love it but it's way too linear to be
immersive and there's way too little
going on for it to be a fun game it's
like the horror I get the horror game
formula now it's watered-down stealth
it's like bare minimum still really
interesting it's a great storytelling
I want the novelization yes I want a
novel or a movie a book the Selma book I
would really enjoy its quality science
fiction with the high ideas and it plays
with them don't stitch all the melee you
can use it when he's holding the bear
okay that makes sense oh we got a we
forgot to poop well you did where that's
why I had an X to poop because the the
bathroom that you can poop in is board
it off
duh of course of course that J yeah with
it now we poop people now why do you
have to poop because poop you get the
bear it makes the bear fall out
it's so loud that that bowel movement
that it knocks the bear off the shelf so
we just put this down where he can find
it yeah
my guess is near the knee of the place
with the generator because that's where
he is
I think that's where he doesn't we think
some bones I'm I don't know if that's
where he is crackhead control says about
some oh so you guys are saying it's a
better to watch the game then play it
yes happy cog such an idea would never
catch on just watching people playing
have a fun time go to youtube and just
watch the like the some kind of movie
eyes video um the interactions and the
story that's he doesn't spawn there
anymore I wonder why he stopped doing
heavy I stopped coming up at first like
a creepy I would be painted on there
with red yeah it was very creepy
it's very spooky alright I guess we just
bring the belt okay oh wait where's the
shotgun when I drop the shotgun Jack
Jack what I put the shotgun did you get
the shotgun yet nope oh my God look not
that door not that there that's the
focus that's the other you're thinking
to the other oh oh you just didn't get
the shotgun in there's a door that's a
trick door and you fall down and break
your leg you don't break your leg as so
much as it falls off alright ringing the
bell ringing the bell I'm armed
oh I've done everything except the boat
the ex is still over by the boat you're
both plane is is too much I don't think
you're both mind I love the boat plan
fuck you I love the boat plan
as everybody else had yeah except for
the guy holding he found people that
were hidden last time I just I love the
look of this it's so cool okay
he's got the teddy bear he can't hurt us
okay so what's the plan
accent accent I'm not gonna waste that
shotgun bullet that's that's for me man
sure so the twist is there's two killers
yes which was a legitimate shock yes oh
yeah or a hammer Birds the rape actually
where's the wood chipper free up the
bone cuz that's oh he oh he picked up
the shotgun he picked up the shotgun oh
yeah he picked up the shotgun that's a
real thing they drop the sandwich ever I
need to hide I need to hide immediately
yes he has a shotgun he glitched out a
little bit the shotgun kind of looks
like his penis right now oh fuck keep
her cool
keep her cool oh we're dead somebody's
dead the blonde lady is dead oh oh he
has your dog your dog is on his head now
but he dropped the shotgun where didn't
put the shotgun no but he already
tripped over the thing Exim I don't know
I'm starting to think this dancing
doesn't work you got a key do it you
guys run into him though is that what is
that on the ground a dead person there's
like a oh shit oh shit he pops up for
like the Jason look oh no you fucked up
and he's got the foot what the fuck was
that oh the music was reminding him of
his childhood or something oh he gets
distracted and you can probably hit him
when he's distracted oh that's smart
where'd he go
did you go in there lady
shit oh you still got him what the fuck
is happening
play good play again you got it you got
it
I got matches I got matches Clara why is
he did he die
did you know he's gonna pop out of one
of these doors in no one oh but I wanted
you oh no she's dead
can't you change Tara never yep lost the
leg but she's alive
oh you got one fucking aw be okay oh my
god you can hide behind that tree right
buddy next to the house oh I lost the
flare gun did he drop it or gone no
that's great
just cuz you know but we lost the rake
yeah we lost the rake already that's a
keep that's not gonna help you the
shotguns and DS you know you could try
the ex again he only has a dog you can
only attack you with a dog right try the
ax just cuz there's no other better idea
oh he's on fire oh and you're dead the
only people you have left
they're both missing legs this is not
gone well this is not gonna be a success
like I you only have one leg but you're
walking as if you have to yeah does he
throw them or does he just drop them
if you hit X he throws one all right I
heard a musical sting I don't know that
means oh oh no oh he's missing a link -
yeah great and his guts are falling out
yeah but that's great and I do believe
it takes a while for it to blow up or if
you're using the match not a while but
you know like it's not instant oh shit
oh my god you have no face fucking I'm
gonna die naked naked man in here do it
we're fucked
we're fucked look even if we beat this
guy there's no way we're getting the
other killer no that teddy bear fucked
the teddy bear you think I mean it seems
like the smart plan
yeah he's dumbing much good well there's
been a series of you know one of those
cans that's beer oh I'll go oh I saw you
doing that earlier where you're drinking
in the screen started - that was nice
yeah
I don't get how this game is fun you
know this is probably one of the only
one of those like fun when playing in a
group kind of situations I am having a
lot of fun trying to figure this out
with rich yeah and we're already doing
this this run yeah this is this is a
doomed run so he's gonna try to hammer
him
oh I might read the zip line but there's
no way we're beating the other dude
there's no way that's gonna happen
that's true that's true I really want
that zip line to work we have not yet
gotten the zip line BAM you're fucked
I think you hit him
yeah it just stunned him yeah Scooby do
it coming in yeah well you can zipline
out of there yeah but it's a kill you
zip line and hit the weathervane and it
lands
oh I see it would not work Frank oh yeah
that would be tricky to get the timing
on yes and we're out of weapons we're
just done okay okay
try teddy bear under the falling crate
trap oh that's not a bad idea does he
stop mean he is it doesn't I don't think
he stops to pick up the teddy bear I
think he just picks it up
who's that oh the other mango that's
like a new bad guy what the hell is as
ugly good yeah we get killed by a zombie
just random zombie out of nowhere you
turn into a zombie
maybe no you haven't you've been playing
now you've got the flow no I'm terrible
what happens if you leave leave where
the gumption leave the game leave
chapter I'm going to leave the game I
love the game that means we're gonna go
back to the movie theater maybe there
was something that we missed in there
maybe that was love there's a movie
theater do ya this is how the game
starts okay there's gonna be something
it happens in that movie theater too
after you beat three and four in there
I'm sure yeah or maybe that's it make
for you haven't I stopped why is Lee you
can't stop working it got too spooky
open broadcaster it's not working oh my
god no how are we still streaming
question for the jet
are we still streaming ah quick question
Chad do you believe that we are still
streaming
oh yeah we're still funny hey look that
yes it's very funny when you say no oh I
get it cuz it's the opposite because
it's like how else would they hear me if
we weren't you know if we weren't
streaming they wouldn't hear me ask the
question yeah yeah but the game starts
the VHS tape that's great - this is
awesome
and then you're just out this alley and
you can switch between these people who
there's like a glitch wow this is
wonderful
although it's very unbelievable that all
those sequels will be playing than the
theater at the same time perhaps they're
having a marathon we would have them all
on the same screen when I feel the other
you wouldn't have part three and four
playing two different theaters coming
soon so I guess probably are they going
to update those I wonder or those
unlockable after you beat should we go
into four and see what's up yeah we're
gonna do that okay that sounds like oh
go Texas Chainsaw Massacre count of the
changing names if they change baby's
left of the survivors so the the other
one was Friday the 13th this one's gonna
be more Texas Chainsaw Massacre
perhaps the film game yeah oh that's
great hey oh right away right away
you just get in to get in the van and
drive away is that an option get
everyone in the van and drive away
except for one fucker leaver he's
driving
they should have some time Texas
Chainsaw Massacre one of the characters
should be an annoying guy in a
wheelchair least likable character from
any horror movie ever
oh alright one of their bullets Oh on
the counter you know what I'm gonna say
yes get someone to have sex with that
lady buddy's all ladies I wonder if we
leave she's in the van now cuz she
getting rendered grab a shotgun and
leave okay alright then I'll leave maybe
they're out of gas
I know I'd leave once I saw the
screaming lady the first thing that you
obviously need to do is have sex on a
counter is there a way to take off your
clothes
oh here we go no Molly popsicle okay was
that gasp gasp go put that in the truck
in the van yep and get the fuck out of
there this is like the secret ending
Ricky's just put gas in there and leave
no okay sounds empty I don't know if
sound designers yep are they leaving
without you
hello puny more gasps oh maybe this one
you just need to like keep filling it up
with gas oh I I have noticed a distinct
lack of having sex on a counter I'm just
well this is Texas Chainsaw Massacre
though that sex wasn't a part of those
movies nope I'm right of the 13 yeah but
somebody's sitting at counter oh did
somebody sit on a counter
I think someone probably did Oh up
there's the house that's where leather
faces or whatever this times equivalent
is there's the slaughterhouse this is
wonderful
and it's making me want to watch Texas
Chainsaw Massacre J do you want slain no
I I want to watch I just want to watch
you play because I've had my fill for
now oh yeah I'd rather just keep
watching this house I'd be too
distracted and frustrated if I was
actually playing it as J watch Shawshank
yet I haven't I can't now it's October
nothing but horror no it's really spooky
I'll watch you know what I'll do this
month I'll watch another Frank Darabont
movie I'll watch the mist and that's
appropriate but after after October then
I'll watch Shawshank I promise or if I
need a break from horror oh did you grab
a chicken looks like a sack of pus hey
lady so I'm you know exit I'm gonna say
you do have to get the gas cans in the
car this one yes
that is also what mark
this is more like Chainsaw Massacre to
wish Lanka I love Texas apes up as a
good - oh it's too dark still dying be a
different person yeah I think I need to
get the van over here okay yeah well
this is the only I need to go in the
house and not fall on a trapdoor
chickens so that's okay
so someone needs to follow me Oh get out
of there gooo
it's the gameplay for this one is
different
yeah it's a little more puzzling figure
out how to my god
I love her look at her mouth her models
a game ah
you killed the victim or is that a bad
guy I don't got a key
I love this shocked expression it's
great I'm gonna get a girl till t it got
all tippy you're disoriented because
your fucking life man you stay out there
and bleed for a little bit I think
that's the recoupment of Leatherface
with the weird thing on the face okay
eat it grab it grab that use it use it
yeah come on
again again more hacking oh my god they
blow up watch there must've been a cask
oh there was I dropped the gas campaign
by the way oh I get it
Chad just said something what their
featherface
that's like a child okay nothing eunuch
counter looking like that you clean
yourself up rich have you ever told your
Texas Chainsaw Massacre four story on
the stream oh I don't know if I have
it's not it's not a super amazing story
Texas Chainsaw Massacre the next
generation I went to see that in a
theater with wood Mike I can't believe
that played in a theater like I thought
that was supposed to be a
direct-to-video thing but I guess I
played in theaters and it's it's not a
terribly complicated story because it's
just
I was laughing hysterically and loudly
and I think I think people heard me in
the next theater over like at the end of
that movie elevator the RV with the old
couple and then the plane happened and I
just completely and utterly lost my shit
I think I lost because I lost that gas
can
Oh your band the band to say okay get
gas to the van
is the name of the game you start in the
gas station this time we're just weird I
don't understand how this is a sequel to
Lakeview Kevin they have nothing in
common okay one thing I know where the
other thing of gas is yeah you can peek
through doors first
so rather than falling into the door and
getting mauled
don't be by the door yeah you can see if
someone's there
what the hell prayer trap oh there's a
bear trap on the ground pick it up wow
that fucked you up what would you say
about B what did we just say Jay that's
great terrible idea it was a great idea
whose best suggestion I ever had a bit
be naked make a lady or maybe here we
will be or would it be Oh baby that's
what he's done okay but I don't see how
that's gonna help me cuz they're there
no matter what oh wait
but are they trap they're too kind just
like they look like victims yeah cuz
they're naked oh they're just running
into you Jesus well maybe you should
have a weapon ready and just murder
that's what I was trying to get this oh
my god okay
alright this lady she's the drummer
she's got it covered she's gonna she's
gonna take care of business yeah we're
gonna murder something I think we have
to murder everybody okay okay Jesus
Christ yeah okay great
murdered Oh God photopigment oh my god
he lost Jesus
or uh you're fucked
I love the switching this is this is the
bass player now you can tell she's the
plainest shut that alarm off oh I killed
you
oh this fucking cunt game it's so
different than the then leg view cabin
three
there's not even a cabin in this
I can't open it cuz I don't have the key
and I can't get the key cuz all the
other way stop turning the alarm on well
I thought maybe if I turn it on I could
get a pregnancy test one of the band
members is pregnant that's deep
clue that's a clue on the man that says
clue I'm starting okay maybe there's a
lake this is a lake and we just haven't
seen anyone follow her Oh what happens
oh oh we need this now sending your leg
oh no this is where we were yep
continuity error what we followed the
screaming lady to a oh my god we
followed the screaming lady it passed
the van I fell into a pit and now I'm
back in the house oh but I fell into a
pit way over there which is it like a
series of underground tunnels I felt
right into the pit now and this is right
under the house oh this is done yeah
maybe the tube slides to the same spot
oh no wait
there was a popsicle yeah that's a good
job good job
hungry rich hey pops who bites into a
popsicle that's bitch nobody bites into
a pop today she looks more of like a
like a like a manager Lee she doesn't
actually play any instruments so I think
we need to fill it up of gas in order to
you know break through the fence right
break through what kind of man are they
country is its country she's a singer
she's totally a country singer
old-school country singer oh sure that's
my that's my oh you're fucked get out of
there get out of there yeah it's just
the death room that's that's just yeah
instant death up to the drummer again
Johnny's found a key maybe knock all
those posts down posts I don't know
something red like on the front of the
house there stretches seems silly but
posts what post
I don't know no mercy posts from Night
Court peeking does nothing like
everyone's like make sure you peek look
shit although endure the saw blades - if
peek when you're in that maze yeah so
you don't fall into the death room does
Jane know about showing a shower with
your dad's simulator oh I remember
hearing about it
okay I'm gonna go back to the maze and
peek in the maze I'm with you peeking
stops you from what you said okay you're
right that is the one case in which
Peking will do me good
okay
but that thing might spill on you yeah I
don't think that's helping probably okay
no good oh yeah won't go to somebody
else but you can find a key this is oh
well your fuck then I don't want to
waste what else can you do Oh God are we
are we about done with this I think
we're about what is the plan I have
literally no plan and my brain is fried
this is amazing
I don't know if I can get it to run I've
been having trouble getting it to run I
can try and get manhunt to run if I want
to give me like 10 minutes yeah yeah
finisher all right let's bring a pause
the stream pausing the stream
cuz I bought it I download it I thought
I patched it to run correctly but it
keeps crashing during the first level I
get a pause the streamer stop Street
uh-oh I'm hovering over the wrong thing
thank you
we're gonna pause the stream starting
