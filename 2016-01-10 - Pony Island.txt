[Part I]
perfect it's hidden from the world how
you doing jack oh great
I was watching some coverage rich of CES
the Consumer Electronic Show case mm-hm
I don't know if you ever watch Linus
tech tips no I've never heard of Linus
tech tips like a computer guy you review
stuff and he's these funny in general
and he was reviewing a new computer case
and computer component system
specifically meant for living room okay
you know the slimmer case design meant
to blend down and along with that he was
designing it and had a special name but
it was essentially a board it was a
fancy board that you wear on your lap
that house is you're a mouse and a
keyboard at all I mean I hit all the
wires but all it was was this fancy
board it was great board I fell out of a
dump job mister board I found at the
dump that's all you need that was my
thing well you need I've already got a
living room desktop yeah I basically my
living room the desk is right next to
the TV a kind like an l-shaped desk TV
Stan and the computers just plugged into
the both the TV and my computer monitor
yeah I can I can I can use the teeth of
the computer from both the desk and the
couch super fancy that's very fancy hi
everybody
why was rich at the dump well to look
for a board of course of course and so
what does this get this game called Pony
Island I know very little about this
game I just know this is the the popular
indie game at the moment and it's not
about ponies okay even though it's
called Pony on so we're gonna click the
left mouse button we're gonna we're
gonna see with pony and all about
I mean I kind of love it already
one of the options this game is the new
hotness that is this is all fine kicking
up the high gear oh my god high gear
baby
maybe how's the audio volume because
there's an audio you know I'm sure it's
fine
yeah I'm sure sure it's fine this time
loop it says I just started watching
Supergirl can you express your level of
disappointment in this show no no real
disappointment because I wasn't
expecting it to be great I want a good
Supergirl show because I like Supergirl
but it's you know it's also by CBS and
so I had very low expectations but I I
made it to three episodes in and I
stopped watching it because I thought it
was kind of bullshit and so audio is
fine great audio works great I'm great
so this is now the game within the game
yeah
error
cheerful facade you know that needs to
be clean
advanced RNG free ticket Pony physics
fixed start menu oh well yeah yeah it's
definitely fixed or is this just just
curious okay
oh I see that do you see it do you see
that the game froze for everyone else um

audio menu we are on it everybody very
sorry there's just too many graphics you
set the graphics setting way to an
average okay great we're on it

screen is fine but go to graphics
quality don't think full screen is fine
well it was on full screen before and
they saw it but it only messed up when
you change the graphics quality too high

okay
nice nice nice rich riches got disc
we're getting out of pokey pokey Pony
Jack can't stop watching this madness I
can it's it's amazing oh that is right
just figured it out already
this is fun it's a fun little thing it's
what do we want here oh by the way quick
cuz I know we talked about this one
Karen was here about uh this is gonna be
a little Star Wars talk and I think now
that it's been out what a few weeks now
yeah so you know mild spoilers I'm not
gonna talk like super spoilers but I did
want to clear up one thing we were
talking about with Star Wars The Force
awakens was whether or not
Rey saw someone used the Jedi mind trick
and I just rewatched it today I went
this morning and we watched it because I
really liked the movie and no she does
not
see anyone use the Jedi mind trick I
think there are some logical
explanations as to how she was able to
use it but to clear that up ray did not
see anyone use the Jedi mind trick she
could have learned about it when she
probed kylo Ren's mind or it could just
be something she had heard about in the
past cuz Jedi's are kind of famous
poni lasers oh oh oh my god oh look at
that nice now go back and turn that off
exactly Tiberius Kirk like kylo Ren is
using a quasi Jedi mind trick and so
it's she can figure it out you can you
can figure out how she can figure it out
but no there's no specific usage of the
Jedi mind trick but
yep yep do it rich oh I love that pony
laser laughs nice
nicely done laughs oh god get him nice
you got this Oh
look this one prism guys
now that rich you nailed it nailed it
but
so no case that was all that was all
know what like we've talked about Star
Wars enough where I don't think we need
to talk about Star Wars anymore but I
know that was whatever you know if it
comes up but that was one specific thing
that I know we were talking about and
and I didn't have the answer for it so I
when I was rewatching it today I was
specifically looking for for that well
what about ash vs. Evil Dead oh I did
watch all of ash versus the evil dead
and I'm prepared to talk about ash
versus the able to help you she did hey
now hey now Satan that ain't nice
Oh
this is it the what
it's a kind of defense that he set up
its a guard the file shouldn't be a
problem since it's locked up
Oh Oh what
as a Zelo
this is not gonna be good
do you believe this would be easy yes
kind of did oh oh oh
that did something okay so uh ash versus
the evil that yeah what what what Oh
my stream tip isn't working right now
hold on I'm about to talk about ash
versus evil bed and then someone gave us
a tip open it up again
not try a Lord Belmont says not trying
to tell you what to do but people are
excited to see Jack rich and J play the
seventh guests will that happen anytime
soon plus J would like until dawn we
don't know what we're usually figure out
what we're playing right before we play
them J hasn't been available to stream
because you know busy with editing other
things but yes we will play the 7th
guest I cannot tell you how long we'll
play it but we will play it one of these
days
ash vs. Evil Dead there was a lot of
things I liked about it and I've really
hated the ending I really left a really
bad thing yes yes let's print on what
you want out of the show right right
oh is he he's playing against you yep
it's funny what you wanted yeah like
like I kind of wanted I understand why
they did what they did yeah if it if you
just wanted like an evil dead mini
series with a conclusion it's bad but
they need to keep it open for future
seasons is the problem no they couldn't
they couldn't resolve it they absolutely
could have resolved it oh you know what
not even resolved it you know what would
have been nice her some sort of
character growth some sort of lesson
learned some sort of change of something
you know
nice nicely done you have a locker you
know you know there was character growth
just not why did he not just you know
why did he do what he did exactly to
save his friend yes the same service but
it was still the easy way out which is
the Asch way which I get by the way it's
very it's very ash how how it ended
it was unsatisfying how it ended
you know there always could have been
more evil you know just because you get
the book just because he stopped the
lady doesn't mean that her demon
children won't do something later I
thought those were pretty cool there was
there was so much potential and as over
so overall it just left a really bad
taste in my mouth it's the real thing
oh no I never write like ash is not
about character growth but like none of
the other characters did anything either
did anything either you know
Oh
fucker fucker fucker you know no one no
one everyone was in the same position at
the end of the season that they were in
at the start of the season uh-huh and I
don't like shows that do that in general
I do I like a little something to happen
I liked it still there was a lot of fun
in there and it was definitely better it
was definitely better binge watching it
yes then then waiting and watching one
thing at a time
oh you got this rich you got this I'm
not so sure about that
but there were and especially at the end
there I want to say like the second to
last episode there was some like really
fantastic stuff you know there was some
really good SLOC and gore but overall I
did like especially at that ending it's
just like so that's all I have to say
about some good some bad like I'm trying
to be in the mindset of someone who
wasn't a huge fan of the series and I
don't know how they would feel about it
but again the show is not really made
for that kind of people so it doesn't oh
did you do it I think so nice watch are
you doing
I will not fail my what's the chat
saying about ash versus evil that no do
to wanna why was Xena even remotely
worried about Ash's life about his life
what sense do you made I don't think she
was ever worried about ash his life I
think
Xena knew that Ash had the power to
defeat her and so that's why she made
the deal she made
oh nothing he makes can be right is that
what that I think
yeah I don't know rich Wow we're fucked
already reg red oak ultima says I have
no nostalgia for Evil Dead whatsoever
the series was okay not great but okay
and I agree has the show proven its
reason to exist ask smokey 885 that's
the important question sure yeah I was
into it was entertaining enough it was
entertaining enough for me
nice you did it it was entertaining
enough for me and I mean I love Bruce
Campbell so much and there was there's
some really fun action and gore and
schlock your profit is false rich do it
delete core file oh yeah
double click and then go up to yes no
double click on delete foreigner oh nice
Oh nope nope missed oh yeah I don't get
why more people aren't talking about
Fargo and how great season 2 was I did
not like season 2 a Fargo have you seen
any Fargo No season 1 is a goddamn
masterpiece yeah since who's alright
Jeff we have been deceived why I don't
know that's what that's the evil thing
said oh no Satan tech Inc is on to us I
did not like season 2 of Fargo as much
as I liked season 1 and again I thought
it had a really crappy ending
one
Oh
maybe go to the messenger
nope try it
what's faster
I get it
another thing I have an ammo count so
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna spam
that's my tactic here will we be
attending be fest I will not be sounds
dreadful I've never gone what I went
once and I loved it it is intense though
because it is 24 straight hours of bad
movies and it's intense and some
sometimes it's horrible but like oh I
probably need to get a certain point
hopefully if I need to do this I mean
it's here we have to assume I thought it
was wonderful and horrible which kind of
made it more wonderful but I will not
just I just can't I can't take that much
time off amen
that's my real thing
can you hold space down oh I can't
you're totally right
nice job rich I improved efficiency you
have you have improved efficiency 1000%
and saved the audience from horrible
clacking noise I tried to stand still
and to shoot whatever comes towards me
yeah that kind of works I can only
assume I have to get to a certain point
I don't think I fucking know I don't
know I think I played pony galaxy's
before I thought you were pony galaxy's
expert I thought that's why we were
streaming this oh don't you want a
ticket Oh is he
let's see if we can get to a hundred
be fest is a really cool thing it's over
at Northwestern University for anyone
who doesn't know and it's it's 24 hours
of movies playing on a big screen bad
movies and it is it's straight like
there's no break there's no stop it's
just bad movies playing on a screen in a
theater full of people and people sleep
in the movie theater people let's find a
place to sleep it on campus well we got
a ticket so that's yeah and it's it's
horrible and wonderful and these is fine
when you find this message hey girl
yeah girl good it's good to see you that
Oz Iselle
guy was mad oh you still there yeppers
did well with that first however we
still have to deal with the other two
right despite the amount of data that
was corrupted security will be increased
it won't be easy for me to open the
other portal other portal I leave and I
have an idea
log on to my user profile the password
is two seven three four two seven three
four okay meet me over there
okay all right get out of here
is there live commentary oh yeah I know
people yell stuff at the screen at B
fest probably log out
you made it over yep
he's never guessed my password thus far
open the search Prague's tool
yes that's not great we need to find a
program with the worst possible security
something less than 5% could allow me to
open another portal to the correct
second core file ok need to be
incredibly poorly programmed ok it's
incredible
oh here we go
never at least to greatest yeah
Oh
Oni Island Exe can you get there oh wait
if you want to be free this machine you
must delve into pol the island once more
I don't hear but it must be tough fine
Pony Island and play it as soon as I am
able to portal the corrupted file okay
great the corrupted profile next to mine
may be worth investigating it says our
friend next to his yeah right if you log
out again there's like a corrupted
profile yeah if people you're wondering
if people talk too much over at B fest
over the movie and that makes it
unenjoyable no no it's fine
the corrupted one but
to say password see if you can just get
in with my password
what was his password again - 7 3 9 2 3
7 9 10 3 7 though
one here try again there oh wait no no
go back in what two three seven nine two
seven they're good
seven Oh was a Niner five
I don't know get out of here go back to
the other one I think we can get in now
which one corrupted yeah now try going
in there we go password back up to seven
three four ponies Lucifer is holding

blood-borne DLC they took a real they
took a turn you know so I have made some
changes to Pony Island Adventure mode is
a game design revolution please refrain
from cheating this rich have you seen
the new breakdown of the new SIOP err
ative and XCOM 2

watching anything of The X Factor
I think I'll see plenty when it's out ok
you don't want any you don't want
anything spoiled for you great I don't I
don't get on hype trains you're not a
hype trainer even 4x come to O be hyper
when it comes out and if I have in my
hands I'll love all of the stuff yeah
that's true you did it I got things to
do oh my god this is new there is a huge
amount of corrupted data north of you
our best chance at opening another
portal lies there play along and
is that nothing what is it
I like your Satan nor it's can we go
yeah
I can't move at all I think you just
have to go okay
we're just playing along here don't
forget about your laser
Laser power over zero what
Oh
if laser power over zero
I'm not sure what it wants just get that
you need to loop it somehow right now
laser power equals zero now it equals
negative one right now laser power
equals one not laser power equals zero
yeah
we need to skip this somehow Oh or we
need to double up on that I don't know I
don't know I get it now when his face
cop out tomorrow you'll know about it
tomorrow all the space cops in is it'll
be available tomorrow with the next
blinky review the next prereq is also
out tomorrow there's a new half in the
bag tomorrow and a new best of the worst
tomorrow it's all happening Oh laser
powers five and now it's six that's
seven you have you've looped it how high
can you go
well bum bum let's get to 20 okay I
don't care that we are from Milwaukee
why aren't we watching the football game
is because fuck the Packers
I hope they die rich is original I know
there's a there's a plane crash the
whole team fucking dies on the way to
the next game
rich is illiterate is originally from
the Chicagoland area and I don't much
care about sports so we don't care about
stuff we don't care about the Packers in
general
this is like a little dubstep ebook II
oh whoa reset you got you yeah
you got you know Jack lying lying about
what uh weather everything comes out
tomorrow no there's also a new Grabowski
tomorrow and what something I probably
shouldn't tell you brand-new dude Bros
coming out tomorrow all the things
they're happening tomorrow traveling
won't be long I don't know when what
this basically asking about Space Camp I
presume yeah yeah all tomorrow at this
point they might actually believe it
though great
tomorrow will be a blinker review for
each Star Wars movie show book ever man
that's true that was no ground
I see two other you need your wing yeah
I need the pony we need to figure out
how to get you a pony wing
who's responsible for this game someone
that level is a little tricky try
levelling up you can cry
experience over here it's away from
where we need to go I don't trust that
right nowhere to go over there there's
no cracker man five to six just once
wants to know whether or not space cop
is going to take 12 years to make so
everyone will know in advance whether or
not it is the greatest movie ever made
oh wait then you already do this
or is this you grinding it is apparently
the grinding OOP
this is the grinding up
you
oh honey look you sound like Palpatine
sometimes sometimes I do a little puppy
no no no space kappahd I don't know like
um because when did you start production
on the original space guy it doesn't
count it's an entirely different thing
I'm just saying could we could we count
it in the 12 years if we were making a
joke
no buts I mean some of the some jokes
need to die some jokes some jokes have
outlived their usefulness the 12 years
to make joke is done it's fine right
that's fine right
I like that fuck you it's space come
experience gained o1o we get pony wings
next level 99 our experiences to go
shouldn't take you too long oh that's
really funny oh nice
nice
it'll take 12 years for that joke to end
you know I like them I like that uh you
know I'm okay I'm okay with any sort of
a joke I enjoy those kinds of things
oh yes so now you need to bypass yeah
easy why can't you play my game the way
I intended
enjoy the wings nice
whose idea was it for the force awakens
half the bag which potentially could
have been the highest viewed half in the
bag EPS whatever
whose idea was it to have it end with
rich saying the c-word fifteen times in
20 seconds mine there was believed in
red that was completely improved
completely I did like that good and you
guys really did film that after seeing
like a midnight viewing for him yeah
that was that was an act oh I didn't
float jump again okay and then can you
just keep hitting jump to fly over at
all you glide to kind of you can't flap
if you hit jump again no okay
rich is a legend yep that cunt is a
spectacular swear word because it's it's
one of the few swear words I think that
still holds some weight yeah you know
like really apparently not over the
cross upon I've heard it doesn't oh yeah
yeah oh they they they use content like
we use fuck uh yeah that's not heard
I still love it I know that that word
really has some weight for me it means
something to me I'm usually pretty upset
with someone if I called him a cunt
which leads to endless accusations that
the reasons Mike enjoyed the film was
because he was tired and doing carry
something
oh no yeah I think Michael genuinely
enjoyed him you know why it's a fun
fantasy movie with action Mike digs that
kind of stuff
cunt is the only word that still makes
girls mad yes that is very true nope
nope I like bint never heard of it I've
never heard of it in Australia cunt is
more like jerk nice
mr. idiot man we've talked about this
whether or not ray is a Mary Sue it
doesn't matter the Star Wars is a
fantasy movie in which space Wizards can
read minds we talked about it
extensively last stream and I just don't
give enough of a shit about Star Wars to
talk about it more we're done it it
doesn't matter if she is the best at
everything ever it's a movie that has
space wizards in it the kind of the
rules logic why you're looking for logic
in a movie that featured space wizards
and mind-reading because you know what
my problem is with the movie was face
Wizards it's not realistic enough is
this britches concentrating he can't be
with me on the jokes here but nicely
done rich
bitch plus cunt equals bint our nice
doo-doo-doo-doo space with space wizards
sorry you're right now a new master
their space Wizards logic is okay in
some movies but you know oh well that
was interesting
how did you get over there interesting
consistency is greater than logic and
fantasy right and I think everything is
consistent in those movies if Ray were
male and had all the same traits and did
all the same things do you think anyone
would care be asserting the same
criticism yes because people really like
to criticize things also I think that
people associate the ability to nitpick
something with that thing being
inherently bad you know and so they like
to look at the force awakens and there
are little maybe it's maybe some logic
flaws maybe little things that don't
make a lot of sense and they say well
because I have the ability to nitpick
this it is a bad thing that's not always
true wait what oh nothing killed me it's
just
you're doing it you're doing it oh my
god
rich you are a pony island oh you jack
jinx oh I'm sorry jack excuse

[Part II]
he's rich but he is battling Satan for
all this right now that's right yeah
the science and physics don't have to
make sense but the story needs to make
sense within the world that exists
that's true that's true and I think it
does with in Star Wars then picking in
itself doesn't invalidate the thing it
says right what talking about something
that actually is intended for children
aren't we
Star Wars yeah yes but again that
doesn't matter I think I think it's
consistent within itself I think they do
a fine job of explaining all the things
they need to explain everything's fine
it's just Star Wars how do I get my
ticket it's it's taunting me Jack it's
taunting probably has something to do
with that start that if I have something
to do with weeping hollow right you
think this isn't I've been where all
right I grabbed a thing that was the
thing there was a thing there yeah what
was there I'm gonna floating face coin
thing a floating face coin you say which
is still gone so I obviously I have
collected it okay well there you go
dude why are we talking about Star Wars
when Adam Sandler made a thing you're
right and there's some sort of alternate
path here is there a place you can fall
down here perhaps purposefully fall down
there
oh wait wasn't there a water on this one
maybe you could fall into the water turn
into this thing that was your mouse yeah
yep
I remember jesting thanks do it adjust
it all adjust it all man that's you know
beer Meister that's a good question this
Pony disarm bombs I like that great
what yeah why would you watch that Adam
Sandler thing we're everybody needs to
be done with Adam Sandler now we no
longer watch Adam Sandler things even
out of morbid curiosity what the hell is
going on it oh you moved the window your
mouse got too high out so
I don't I know nothing about the Star
Wars extended universe what are they
saying about the Star Wars extended
universe telegin is asking who's my
favorite Star Wars extended universe
characters or expanded etu character I
assume EU means I hate the EU like
almost almost across the board yeah
except I like the game Jedi Knight so I
guess it's Kyle Katarn by default there
you go there you go I think I'm gonna
say Han Solo how the turns basically Han
Solo with a lightsaber
oh then guitar he sounds awful you say
he get all the fun Jedi stuff like light
swords without the bullshit philosophy I
like that I like that you get all the
fun magical ass-kicker II without the
spirituality crap there's a there's an
animated show that my kids like watching
Star Wars rebels that takes place before
a new hope and there's a young Jedi in
training there and he makes his own
lightsaber and this is a show that is on
the Disney Channel it's meant for kids
you know his lightsaber is half
lightsaber and a half a light slingshot
like you can turn it over and it like is
it it's a slingshot that swings like
laser bolts to see straight
straight out of the ear straight out of
the extended universe but I was like oh
that's cute you know what kids like that
it's cute it's it you know I think it's
not a bad show we've only seen the first
season but it's fun I have some fun
characters it is the oh it's on Disney
XD sorry Tiberius Kirk
it's cute perfectly acceptable you like
how rich denies he loved Star Wars rich
and go my my commit sorry why do you
think it's denial rich is a man who
loves hard boring science yes yes Star
Wars is a fantasy movie take Star Wars
and instead of x-wings they're riding
dragons and set up lightsabers they have
swords and you would have a Lord of the
Rings movie it is a fantasy movie rich
likes hard science it's it's perfectly
reasonable oh my god how do you do that
one that's a fun puzzle huh yeah gravity
rebels is a fun show I really like
rebels it's fine it's fine
oh that's right rich because you fucking
love Star Wars that wasn't rich that was
just some guy in a Darth Vader mask but
it's true yeah so I don't know what
you're talking about
there's no proof that space wizards
don't exist you're right Jetix text
you're right you're right dude dude dude
hard science I hear that HBO is making a
foundation series will azimoff roll in
his grave HP has been making some good
stuff so they might do some justice I
have watched a little bit of the Clone
Wars cartoon and man is that ugly oh
wait there's a couple Clone Wars
cartoons there's like the ugly one and
the good one right I have never seen a
single frame of either show there's one
that has like an animation style kind of
like Samurai Jack and I think that's
supposed to be the good one ohh oh my
god you just hacked your way out of that
and then there's one that's like 3d
animated and all the humans look ugly as
sin so I could never watch it because
all the humans are ugly as sin you don't
even have to double-click on the jump
you just hold it down okay and the wind
pops out at the height at the top that's
nice yeah I can't I don't think those
are supposed to be the hard gloomiest
past rich hmm did you not make it
through that's where I did what perhaps
there's something else
yep in this level
yeah I've heard great things about the
tart Chuck coughs key1 the person who
could samurai jacket Dexter's Laboratory
and Powerpuff Girls right but there is
there's a Clone Wars cartoon that that
didn't Guinea
Jenny kindy gandi gandi did so anyway
did my kids see the new movie yeah they
saw it twice I took them both done
because they like him there's a thing
there's a thing I want to get my pony
ticket yeah you have to find where's my
pony ticket what happens if you just
click back to the first one now
interesting so yeah like they both liked
it they liked it just fine they loved
they loved all of Finn's one-liners all
of his goofiness yeah they cackled like
like children
I think it's up I thought I saw way up
there
into the light yeah do you see like go
to the go to the tree wait wait wait
stop
it's not go to the tree mm-hmm upper
tree and now go left and do you see how
your mouse kind of curves towards it
then I go oh good hijack you see it well
there it is
good eye
I'm super smart Gandhi Jake what he
helped work up our oh so cool get ya
genndy also did Hotel Transylvania which
is not good in what in any sense
whoa
whoa
okay rich yeah if you had to live in a
space adventure movie choose between
alien event horizon and dead space you
just have to live in that universe alien
alien hey why wait well in the universe
that's what they say well you have to
maybe they mean you have to live in the
movie or the game in in dead spaces let
Verizon you're definitely fucked oh god
you're super fucked
super super amazing fuck brothers I've
seen that movie you're super amazing
fuck brothers yeah you can't fight in
Inventor Eisen alright dead space I
don't know enough about we played it at
once we played it that one I think that
seems to be an awful lot of monsters
though there's an awful lot of death and
if you're not the main character you're
kind of fucked I'm not the main
character right alien you have a chance
oh there's a splitting path here rich
you know what I would I might choose
dead space just because I think they
have more weapons available and so it's
like I want the highest probability of
winning alien or aliens or just they
said alien
I mean really alien and you just get in
the scape pod first thing seriously but
you don't know if you're on the ship
with the alien that's the thing you just
have to live in the universe look murder
incidence is not a choice but you're
dead no matter what pretty much
I'm not surviving any of these choices
so why do I care I I just like the idea
of like you have to live in this
universe and you know like let's say you
live in in the alien universe right and
you just know that the aliens exist but
you never know if you're on that
spaceship with the alien that would be
terrible or you know like you live in in
the event horizon world and maybe you're
on a spaceship maybe you're not
traveling past Pluto but you like you
just know it's out there you know that
the hell is out there but no friend
horizon yeah but you're not on the event
horizon you don't you don't know that's
my that's my that's the thing I'm adding
to it is you just live in the universe
in the world here's the thing no in a
world where hell is confirmed to exist
yeah
then logically so is heaven
so you'd become a devout Christian well
I would have some evidence if there
being a god
okay and then you know living forever
sounds kind of sweet okay okay it's
probably the most hopeful of the options
if you don't have to be on the event
horizon ship it is if you're on the
event horizon ship you end up in hell
which is the worst possible case
scenario right but you just live in the
universe you would choose the event
horizon universe is not beyond the event
horizon ship just so you could become a
devout fine Jesus give all your money
away to charity live in poverty and then
take sunshiny beaches babes and drinks
all day for eternity rich you you're
cold logic this is why I logic is better
than space wizard
sprays wizards probably want to fight
the monsters something stupid oh yeah it
was an actual hell it was metaphorical
hell dimension thing but we don't know
that that's hell I tell maybe then
there's a metaphorical heaven dimension
thing and we can get there as long as
you know we accept Jesus into our lives
I like that I like it I think rich has
some solid logic and reasoning here so
it makes me rich Evans system makes you
rich Evans I this assumes rich goes to
heaven look once I have once I am
evidence this is the real thing of the
afterlife then you can convert
absolutely okay
absolutely what do I need to do to get
to get my my eternal loveless I will do
that oh that is a bargain what do you
need that is a bargain sir give up all
my worldly possessions and spend my
dedicate my life helping others
absolutely I get into heaven
great don't think this way no see that
round is a dead end
there's harder to single this there I'm
sure Oh won't have the option
oh my god it seems like we've been we've
been doing a lot of the same stuff for a
while now but but convert to what hey
you know whoever's closest
which needs to convert to an audio
compressor even with a compressor it's
never it nothing can help returns
bankers are gonna win this one good
is this the playoffs way they're gonna
win do we want to win them to win or
it's terrible I don't know
oh sorry everybody I'm cracking my
knuckles out of habit and I don't know
if you heard that I know some people do
not like the sound of knuckles cracking
I enjoy it because it makes me think of
cracking my own knuckles which is
something I enjoy we don't want the
Redskins to win okay great nope why
don't we want the Redskins to win I have
nothing against the Redskins
I'm sure the Redskins are fine people
they're all fine for you you know listen
except for their horribly racist name
besides that besides that and their
insistence that it's not horribly racist
I'm sure they're all fine people if you
remove that one thing so you just want
both of them to be hey I don't oh no you
did it his ex over is it yeah great you
did it great
oh oh there's more let me find out what
that other thing was sure sure
doo-doo-doo I would choose to live in
the Bible cinematic universe don't think
they haven't thought you've done a while
to find me Mordor and go back to leave
this place or I may show you a vision
what dreams may come cinematic universe
may be but the actual like biblical
Bible probably not the best idea
God's a prick pay any attention to the
Bible oh here we go and it sounds like
God's idea of heaven may be having your
freewill stripped and sitting there
worshipping God for eternity if it's a
nice stick with stick with stick with
what dreams may come
Abu al Kindi he fought for his his name
was Abu al Kindi
he fought for his city that was the
person who killed me okay so we're
Theodore
we are Theodore we are dead we we left
behind a mother and daughter and abu al
Kindi killed me he fought for his city
so some lost soul lost soul is going to
be AB well kindy Oh
anything to kill me again or if you're
trying to help Theodore these wood names
or something this is some kind of
historical reference to something I'm
sure I'm sure it has a very deep meaning
that we're not grasping okay great
can we get out of her chair what back oh
sorry yeah Redskin owner is Jewish so
good luck calling him racist oh if he if
he insists on having the name Redskins
he's a racist
so Jew can't be a racist anyone could be
anyone can be erased yes that's that's
how it works
see you too much nuke too much nucleus
posted a link that will have spoilers in
it so we will not read that wink to link
to your Wikipedia article doo doo I told
you to take a break I need more time
here you're not ready for the boss fight
typo
hold on yeah call them the Jew skins
that might be nice
where's that ten-foot pole where is it
you're not touching this one I can't
find our Pole oh I guess we're not
touching it I thought it I thought that
was a funny comment and I decided to
read it probably I probably shouldn't
have but hey that's it's fine
everything's everything's gonna be fine
oh that's an excellent onion article
everyone should read that okay here we
go oh oh we got a lot of red now a lot
of people are talking about create more
ponies do it oh yeah well oh thank you
my Zuri - yeah Meissner not to get back
on on Star Wars but yeah the other thing
we did talk about was Ray's ability to
fly the Falcon which was a bit of a
problem for me in the rewatch I was
looking out for that she does have a
throwaway line about being a pilot
though never going off planet
she has flown before and later when
she's talking to Han Solo she mentioned
specifically working on the Falcon with
its current owner and so she would be
familiar with the Falcon and she has
flown before so everything's fine
no more Star Wars talk let's see here
people still care about Star Wars it's
it's still pretty it's pretty close
okay great thanks jack yeah so Meisner
Meisner one is correct they did they did
address that in the movie and
everything's fine all the time rich okay
getting back to fun subjects rich if you
could live in the universe of the room
Battlefield Earth or trawl to which
would you have to go with the room yeah
yeah but but you never know he's gonna
try to turn you into plants you know the
deal with these monster aliens yeah you
just though you never know if if Tommy
Wiseau is gonna show up and start
talking to you you could which is worth
it people just keep randomly walking
into your house and saying hello hello
hi rich oh hi mark a higher ed oh hi
jack
you seem to be doing good today want to
throw football hello world's
you're moving to San Fran later this
year that's great San Francisco's a
lovely place I hope you do well I love
tossing the ball around what
what I don't know what okay great no oh
hell-oh not loading
yeah these puzzles are getting old yeah
great
how about the Star Wars or Indiana Jones
universe whatever okay great great I
might choose this tower's universe it
might be super fun to fly in space
she's always blown up she's always you
know an Indiana Jones universe has
non-stop Nazis I don't want that I'd
rather have my planet suddenly blow up
whole games getting a little bit I'm
hoping we're getting close to the end I
don't know if that's I doubt that's true
and we have we have you gotten second
thing deleted yet No oh yeah oh Lord
Belmont have either of you heard the
disaster artist audiobook I highly
recommend it also are you excited for
the disaster artist movie I still have
yet to read the book I have yet to see
the movie I have to still haven't seen
the room what do you read the book all
right
oh yeah that's good I hear great things
about it
surely fine
surely fine rich it's got nothing today
rich has got nothing today zero
punctuation picked undertale as his game
of the year no but it's good fine game
oh yeah whatever one says his game here
I'll give a shit it's a completely
meaningless designation has nothing to
do with what you like I think it's great
undertale was was a lot of fun I don't
know if I'll ever I'm not really
compelled to finish it but it was a lot
of fun I can see why someone would
really like it so good good I'm glad I'm
glad it's doing well I'm always happy
when independent things do well I like I
like that uh tourism I like the idea of
just you know making something because a
pluck and gumption gonna make this
little game about a bunny rabbit I'm
gonna do it you see sometimes they work
I'm kind of I'm gonna make a little game
about a spaceship and you and you got a
fire at things but you could always
pause it hop kind of toy
oh speaking of did you see the did you
see the trailer for dead bolt dead bolts
dead bolts no hop on the hype train the
risk of rain team is getting ready to
release their next game okay
dead bolts tell me about dead bolt it is
a 2d pixel graphic oh oh right right in
their wheelhouse but it's an action game
with a stealth a key on stealth and so
you have to go you play this like
skeleton face man and you have to go
around killing people but there is a
there is a there's a huge stealth
element to it and it looks interesting
yeah there's not a lot of gameplay you
can glean from it yet but like the risk
crane and Chris Chris to do Lou the guy
who did the risk of rain soundtrack he
was doing the soundtrack forever so it
very least have buying the soundtrack
yeah yes dead bolt is just like wedlock
thank you
then deadbolt
it's like wedlock nice thank you
everybody for getting it tell us the
wedlock joke yeah you know I don't never
want to get married never want to get
married you know
you know wedlock that's a little too
close to deadbolt for me okay so who
told that joke again it was a stand-up
comic that I saw years and years and
years ago and in a sleazy stand-up comic
comedy plays and that was his joke and
crowd went nuts it ruined your faith in
humanity no I loved it at the time I was
young I was very young when I heard that
joke and I just loved the idea of
stand-up comedy which game has the best
music risk of rain I've said that over
and over and over again risk of rain has
the best soundtrack that is a soundtrack
I just listened to on its own from time
to time because I loved it so fucking
much Chris Chris to do also just
re-released all of the sound assets for
the game every single bleep and loop in
the game you can purchase and make your
own songs from the risk of rain engineer
edition but uh oh no I missed the
blood-borne speedrun oh my god Oh agdq
yeah for games done quick yeah someone
beat blood-borne in 46 minutes
they probably glitch the fuck out of it
though I'm gonna tell they do these
things I want to re-watch it I'm gonna
rewatch it I I miss just about all of 80
agdq yep Karen wasn't um oh sure I had
it in the background while I was doing a
lot of stuff always fun did you see the
the two-player Metroid any of that oh no
you miss Sullivan yeah there was they
were doing a Metroid run where one
person controlled the d-pad and one
person controlled the buttons that's
work together it was great it was great
yeah Fez has a good soundtrack I have a
lot of video game soundtracks that I
really like
it was a bad unengaging run well I'll
put it on in the background I just like
to see how he like got through some
stuff I think that'd be fun
right now by the way in blood-borne for
anyone who is playing the DLC I just got
to the orphan of Kos and that guy's
awesome he attacks you with like he has
a weapon but the weapon looks like a
meat slab with a blade on it and it I
can swing around on a chain it's awesome
hello Beelzebub dot exe doopa doopa
doopa I wasn't that great around well
put it on there was a blindfolded
punch-out that was great I didn't catch
that I caught that okay
now games done quick is always fun you
know and it's always fun they have fun
gimmicks great crypt of the necrodancer
has a great soundtrack what was what was
that game now that we played a Titan
titanfall not titanfall Titan
okay what is that cold tighten tighten
tighten tighten what's happening go away
Satan Satan
obviously FTL soundtrack is an amazing
soundtrack what is that I have to
remember
Titan souls the soundtrack for Titan
Souls is really really great and that
Dave David Fenn did another game called
leaf me alone and I've never played the
game but I have the soundtrack and I
think it's great David
Fenn someone uh knows the other
soundtrack someone sent me a song that
was really great
oh life formed the the fast fall
soundtrack is also really great so that
meat slab is the placenta from the dead
thing that the orphan comes out of
that's so great
I'm having I'm losing that fight a lot
but it's a fun fight so I think I'm
clicking off screen a lot oh sure
I wonder if you can find a way to to
fullscreen it but just change the
resolution so it probably you can run
fuck around with that for an hour one
hour
yes Titan Souls yeah the Titan Souls
soundtrack is really amazing
dooty dooty to do
they're saying aim for the jaw I'm doing
okay great
the mouse is moving see if we have to I
have to play this in a window or a blown
stream right and the mouse is hitting
the desktop rather than the game
frequently and that's fucking things up
you're doing it right there you go
you're doing it Oh see it click on
screen luckily though when you click off
screen it usually pauses it nice nice
you're doing it okay great what am I
looking at you are looking at what is
this called again pony island Pony
Island a game not about ponies
you're doing it Peter now you are being
led astray can't you see that destroying
these files will prevent you from
playing Pony island but is drawing the
files is the only way to advance the pot
oh that's great there's a meta meta to
this meta game apparently this game is
nothing but met up
for oh that's gas in the real world
that's great that's great this game was
made by Charlie Kaufman I get it
this is Oh Charlie Kaufman Charlie
Kaufman
did you ever see adaptation Oh Oh did
you see that yeah we're just in the real
world for the real one for a little bit
or Being John Malkovich yeah yeah I was
thinking of Andy Kaufman yeah yeah all
right did some meta stuff but I don't
see what you'd make the connection if
they go foot yeah we we were in full
screen and obaa kept on pausing there
earlier like it wouldn't it wouldn't
stream runs black screen or frame frozen
frozen oh yeah OBS so that's why we have
to go not full screen obviously it still
looks full screen to you oh wait can you
um can - what can you look at OBS for a
second they're telling us but everything
looks fine to us oh I thought they said
that something was wrong
nevermind next time it's fine
everything's fine adaptation is a great
movie that is true isn't he he's working
out a new one
there's a new Charlie Kaufman movie
coming out I think oh that's it right
animal animal ISA and ammo Lisa is the
new
okay so this is the new pony island I
like that how after after we got ghasts
we immediately went back to play more
Coney Island there was no other there
was any other option oh no I know I
think it just turned okay I wasn't
paying enough attention to what was
going on you'll need it to blow away
butterflies oh you don't want to do the
upper right hand corner the fit oh yeah
there's there's a little black dot over
here you know that is that that's
actually the greens oh yeah hold on
there there sorry the green screen
creeps sometimes and we weren't noticing
it a lot during the game because the
game was black and white sorry about
that I took care of it you know what I
did I just shoved the green screen
that's how I fixed it is there is this
pink pony in space cop no this
particular pink pony makes no appearance
in space Goblin
yeah that was the flowy voice the flower
voice for my little devil I guess I
could I could choose a different voice
for a little devil here devil like this
hey yeah I don't know Terrell looks like
flowery mixed with papyrus I make I make
your food off spicy huh huh hmm
you win
looks like it's time for the brain
whoa we we've got ourselves a puzzle
this goal is to get this border fly over
to its home this is fucking weird man
the questions over his head yeah now
there's a triangle over on that side and
it's easier - everything's fine have you
seen the walk it's awful no I have not
seen the lock
father mucker yes yes I did the voice
sounds like my spoons to big guy I don't
know what that is I don't either
yeah so I'm sorry
yes I will I will read any Tarantino
dialogue in the flower voice I don't
remember asking you to say a damn thing
what's that now yellow thing over there
an hour can you move it
no you can move those signs though right
but
okay well can you work the big Sam no
and you can't move the yellow thing
whatever that yellow thing is what
happens if you put a sign in the yellow
thing nothing no that yellow thing
why can't even get over there so it's a
moot point well I'm just saying okay oh
I know what you do I know what you do
move the right arrow to that one yeah
yeah okay great
that one that pause there immediately
when he jumps over wait till he jumps
over now put the right air on that one
so I try it didn't work
yes I didn't do it sooner no and like
all right I don't know that I don't know
I don't know why do you expect me to
know these ah ah did you do my spoon is
too big you from web cartoons okay great
hey Jack did you ever read the issue of
chew I stuffed in with the Wonder Woman
comics oh yeah I did eat like a
detective story was amazing what stuff
thanks for sending those by the way I
appreciated have I seen the human race
it is wonderful I have no I'm sorry
doo-doo-doo-doo FYI rich the Packers did
not get hit by an airplane and in fact
won the game the Packers won well that's
shitty apparently that shitty I'm so
sorry
how are we feeling about this game now
get it old it's it's getting terrible
but it's getting old I'm really happy
that they decided to switch it up I
would like them to switch it up again
can you move the big sign sorry your
honor you're already on it been learning
about DSLR photography I have a Sony do
you prefer to buy your D s always based
on your needs or based on shooting style
I I have a DSLR and a couple good lenses
and I find universally that I rarely use
it if that makes any sense
wow you're really smart
Wow let's get back to our adventures
best not to touch the nose
I do you know cuz I have a regular video
camera which also which my lenses are
swappable with and I just find that I
rarely use my DSLR because it's too much
of a pain in the ass video wise you know
very short battery life little memory
card space no audio no good audio inputs
so you know I have it in case I ever
need a second camera and I can't use J
Mike's camera I have it but basically I
have it as a just in case ER and I've
had to use it a couple times and I have
used it a couple times where I my DSLR
does look nicer than my big camera it
has a higher video bitrate setting and
so I can get a sharper image from my
DSLR which unfortunately means I can use
1/4 of the SD card space and I need to
be really careful about when I use it
but I've used it for some projects and
it's looked great Jack here very
pleasant person I try to be
I have the same thing with my dear so I
kind of want to buy a little point like
no you know it's no I don't know I mean
- oh sorry it's a beer skirt my DSLR hat
we're not got any donations where's our
what the fuck no we've had a car
yeah I've been so engrossed in this pony
game I guess I haven't noticed we've had
a couple I have addressed them place for
head to scream to release soul or
continue what's on my shirt this is a
classic slice pizza shirt and so it is a
it is a picture of a pizza I've worn
this year before on the show it's a
picture of a pizza within like an
Illuminati Pizza symbol oh you have to
fight god oh that wacky devil nice
oh nice you killed Jesus
yay
all of those DSLR complaints are valid
my biggest issue at this is my inability
to hold the camera steady while shooting
video that's true get you know and you
know what get yourself a monopod get
yourself a monopod and you can still get
that handheld look that kind of jiggly
look but it'll be a lot steadier you kid
great that's really great oh so I mean
dslr's there's there's a lot of good to
them the the biggest good to them is
their price
the DSLRs are universally cheaper than
pro grade video cameras so there's a lot
of good to be had there you just need to
understand their limitations and and
work around them and a lot of times when
you work around their limitations like
getting extra batteries or getting power
adapters or getting more memory cards or
getting better lenses you end up with
you end up spending the same amount of
money you would spend with a nice video
camera no with your face I'm just I
don't know what's wrong with me
I'm very sorry hi I
right I'm scared mama what the cat fuck
is coming out of my mouth that was my I
was trying to like distort his voice a
little bit to kind of glitch it out and
it just started doing them and so that's
just that's just what was happening and
I apologize if I permanently scarred
anyone but that's just meant to just
sound worked ASIC comes off none I feel
like a dingus propping up my monochronic
hammer against the wall when I walk away
from shooting yeah yeah Jack found the
acid it's true Jack save Jack rich save
him there's no saving Jack there's no
saving me there's no saving me yeah
why do you network hold your horses
whoever just tipped us Lord Belmont says
best of 2015 for you to Sicario the
hateful eight the revenant Mad Max fury
road or Brooklyn also have you seen the
big red one with Mark Hamill you know
what my real problem is I've only seen
one of those movies which is Mad Max
fury road and Mad Max fury road is
amazing and Mad Max fury road is amazing
I made the worst choice ever over my
vacation I had an opportunity to see the
revenant and I chose not to I chose to
see Jurassic world instead and that was
a poor poor decision I thought another
opportunity would come up in which I
could see no the revenue no and it did
not and so and I wasn't sure whether or
not Lisa would want to watch oh yeah
just choose you know the safe option and
that was the bad I'm very sorry I'm very
sorry
Mad Max is great though okay what is
this
anonymous just sent us a picture that
they drew for us thank you and I'm as I
love that picture I know Mike said he
loved Jurassic world and I have yet to
talk to him about why he loved dressing
room but I would I would hedge some bets
and say that he he probably doesn't
remember much about Jurassic world so
that's what I'm gonna guess at least I
can lie but every likes Mike and like I
don't care it's fine
is it is it fine I have not seen the
hateful eight what are your views on
Tarantino in general I really like his
movies he's a very talented filmmaker I
don't I I think I I have I think
Tarantino has a very interesting way of
making films and usually you hate his
movies until you're halfway through and
then they're the best things ever and I
you know what I still haven't seen
Django I haven't seen Django Unchained
yet I saw I'm just behind up behind many
times but Tarantino is a great filmmaker
he makes good movies I'm sure that
hateful eight is great you know why he
makes good movies I can't think of a bad
Tarantino movie I'm sure there's one I
just can't think of it
dammit I don't know what do you have any
specific feelings on Quentin Tarantino
no okay as I tried it it's fine fine
person finally at five five okay he's
fine filmmaker
yeah Jurassic world is really mad I made
a tweet the other day where it's like
right now I watched Jurassic world less
than a week ago and I cannot remember
any character from Jurassic world like
it or I can't remember any names the
name of any character from Jurassic
world and I saw it less than a week ago
so
so no I don't I'm sure people have views
I'm Quentin I think it's fine I actually
might that's my biggest problem with
Quentin Tarantino is I never feel the
urge to like go out and see his movies
because I'm sure they're gonna be great
oh I think he did it no I know I'm sure
they're gonna be great and I'm sure I'll
see them eventually and then they'll be
great so I never have any urgency to see
his movies because I know they're gonna
be great no I hate this puzzle rich
hates this puzzle I hate all of humanity
I also hate this puzzle I already forgot
about Bohr - you're right pillow again
oh good old bort bort from Jurassic
world there was though there's a big
there's a subplot in Jurassic world
about bored and running out of name tags
and the theme park or something like
that I remember that specifically Oh
bort you know I in in general I'm not a
fan of you no longer movies with
intermissions but I'm sure I'm sure it's
gonna be fine I don't like the idea of
an intermission I don't like the idea of
leaving a movie and I'm coming back to
finish the movie but that was how he
wanted to make the film so I'm sure it
takes that into account
please get rich out of whatever slump
he's in tonight you know party that's
the game part of that too the weather
which is rich is just rich I'm okay
tonight he's fine what do you what do
you want out of me what do you people
want your fight you're fighting Satan
and playing Pony Island I'm trying to
figure out this puzzle I've had my fair
share of jokes tonight yeah
so if an y'all could settle the fuck
down is there is there anything that
that Butchie flower is there anything to
do with that Gucci flower so now that I
can figure out I couldn't put anything
on it okay the the digital projection
showings of hateful a don't have an
intermission oh I think I would almost
prefer the intermission just because of
how long it is I'm gonna need a bathroom
break so no no like I saw last year
during the Milwaukee Film Festival they
showed 2001 a Space Odyssey with the
intermission break and the the overture
and all that and it was fine it was it
was hard coming back to it though after
the intermission just cuz I'm so used to
a one sitting movie mm-hm
so it was just a hard adjustment but if
I go in knowing that you know I'm sure
we find everything it's always fine
everything's always fine jaqen firm for
tiny bladder sometimes sometimes I like
coffee and beer I like I like a lot of
liquid in me at all times let's see here
nope do rich try to send the blue
butterfly to the glitchy flower mm yeah
I like that idea
see what happens if you move here if you
move that alright I like that I like
that my last encounter before this enter
back to leave this place so I may soon
show you one final vision show me wha
did we die at a Renaissance Faire
when did I die where did I go how did I
get here ooh I mean we might be what if
what if you know what if this get rich
yeah this game is hell yeah that's what
I'm thinking what did you just figure
that out
well like I got a bet it was hell but
it's like it's actually hell yeah yeah
how did I get here maybe I'm starting to
type in how did I get here and it's
gonna say you were not a good man or
something right yeah
how did I get here lol fuck macaque yep
so exam Bell damn souls come here before
moving on okay great
okay
hi great Oh No
yeah idea I don't wanna do this no more
Oh has it always done that glitch thing
yeah this puzzle sucks
maybe now let the blue one go all the
way down he goes nowhere
huh he goes nowhere thank you this
button here yeah needs to be hit to open
that game somebody needs to be going
through that gate at the same time this
button gets pressed right oh right right
I don't know I don't know
John you have two pink one into the
house before the door closes put
splitter first put it back to first what
so that didn't work
teleporter in the middle make the
butterfly on the far right get looped to
the middle oh there we go
Hey nice to be fair I figured it out
right before you started reading the
chat okay but thank you thank you but I
didn't I didn't need any of you you were
figuring it out you were on your way you
were right on your way

[Part III]
I guess this is a returning it into
Columbo just one more thing mr. sage
something's been bothering about this
man on the horse you say my wife always
hated horses so I know that couldn't be
my death we're talking about just you
know if you could clear this it's my
fault I'm a forgetful type check you're
a great Columbo I live I love Columbo so
hard so hard so much oh do you need to
do an Nvidia graphics test I need to not
click off-screen behavior
have I seen Das Boot directors cuts it's
200 minutes no no I have none no I have
not
I'm not that kind of film nerd so I was
thinking it was dust foot that's what
the 200 minute cutoff joke which is just
dust foot playing eighty times good
peter falk but not enough glass i yeah
mr. Columbo confirmed for police quest -
oh we need to do police quest - soon
yeah well here's the question what do we
do first police quest - where do we
finish undertale
oh you you do want to finish Undertown
Oh as well okay I love it well then we
should finish you know I like the idea
of wrapping something up before starting
something new so if you would like to
finish undertale no no so excited for
daredevil season 2 hope rosario Dawson
has more screen time the Elektra casting
seems well suited unsure about the
Punisher however I did not die are you
unsure about the Punisher Chad Chad Chad
person I like the actor they have in the
Punisher he was in this I don't know I
don't know anything about what they've
cast he was in season wanted to have
Walking Dead and he is really good at
playing an intense creepy guy that kind
of so I like him as the Punisher
he makes perfect since I have not read
who they cast as Elektra and I don't
care to read that I don't yeah i mean
Punishers is is a great nemesis i love
The Punisher as a character he's great
he's alright and he's got his notes but
his notes will clash well with
Daredevils you know mm-hmm so I think I
think it's a good he's a good daredevil
Foyle he's a good daredevil Foyle I'm
looking forward to the night to the new
season
do Columbo from Murder by Death
I hate I I don't I think I think the I
don't I in general don't like the
Punisher just because I think he has one
note he hits one note and then he gets
it he hits it very well he hits it very
well but it gets old
I think he'll work well Reid Reid Garth
Ennis pleasure I know you keep down I'll
get to it I'll get to it but he did both
serious Punisher and then he did dark
comedy Punisher some choose your poison
of Garth eNOS Punisher and read it oh
sure
oh no and like Punisher will especially
play well with what daredevil in the
show because like you know what I need
to say this time I hate Jesus I really
hate Jesus what what what
cuz like the first season of daredevil
was all about him trying to balance like
whether or not he was gonna actually
kill someone right and the Punisher yeah
I'm gonna kill someone the Punisher the
Punishers biggest decision is how I'm
going to tell someone like I'm gonna
kill everyone but do I want to use my
gun my knife don't want to strangle him
so it's it'll he's going to play nice I
the suit looks a little bit better
they had a teaser out a teaser try me
how did they change it it just looks
toned down it doesn't it's it's not as
good as the black suit yep still because
that black suit is so fuckin badass
it looks better
but do do do do do do we know what the
punish is wearing I don't we don't know
what the Punisher is wearing I think oh
now they're gonna fuck around with an
origin story for The Punisher they're
just gonna get right into it we should
be the smart thing in my opinion well
you know they didn't really fuck around
they didn't give kingpin an origin story
like at the beginning they they peppers
fruit yeah so I can only assume they'll
do a similar thing with the Punisher
button but we don't need to see him it's
like a regular guy for the three
episodes hold on you've turned me into
the punish yeah oh god I hope that
doesn't happen they've still never
called them daredevil on the show right
I don't say they have at some point near
the end they just calm like the devil of
somewhere something right oh yeah they
just come the devil like he's not the
daredevil yet the devil of unkown what
are they called again Hell's Kitchen the
devil of Hell's Kitchen
hey you killed Jesus hey rich he'll be
dead he'll be back in three days
yeah oh that black suit fit the series
so well
beer Meister I agree with you that black
suit was the fun level oh oh oh that's a
horrifying visual everyone vomiting so
oh you killed Louie I don't know if you
were supposed to do that tip alert er
you're not refreshing
I
okay friendly bartender says I love it
that Poland found its way into your
conversations on a number of occasions
Poland has it zoo Laos keys possession
more than once my dear dear
so have a big juicy lol fuck my cock
from central Poland or perhaps people
from Poland Thank You friendly bartender
I'm not I'm not sure where Poland has
infiltrated our conversation but we will
accept your tip do
yeah that's true and did you finish
Jessica Jones no they didn't they didn't
really do anything with kilgrave he was
just kind of there yeah they didn't give
him like his own like tragic origin so
well I guess they say they kind of did
but they much like kingpin they peppered
it in throughout the episodes it wasn't
like a it wasn't a dedicating thing they
did well they took their time with their
characters and I like that I do
yeah oh I mean if even if they give the
Punisher back sir because like the
Punisher is his own Oh the Punisher is
his own backstory you know I killed
people because that's the only way to
stop them
a corrupted profile next might be
information how okay lower that and then
let's go into a portal Jim
interesting Oh what did I say security
something security exception
what
hello
No
but
you've sucked for centuries
I have a truth to tell you
you're out the only draft so there are
thousands like you they do not surrender
to Lucifer and fell screaming into hell
but they are stuck all the same perhaps
on a puzzle perhaps on a level you have
destroyed two of the three core files if
you are still resolved I will help you
find third that's some recycling bin
that is their second in there you could
find the pony islands of old versions of
the game that he created and then
discarded search through the discarded
game okay find me a place räikkönen
plays a portal to the final qualifier
yes you fire what what no I don't know
talking they I thought they were talking
about Jessica Jones but I don't quite
understand what's gone there have a good
night Lord Belmont
Lord Belmonts going to get coffee
because he wants to play blood-borne
you know right Colbert that's so right
at all
that's totally for blackness a shimmer
of light we'll rich Evans win any Golden
Globes tonight are the Golden Globes
tonight behold the screen continue I
know what this is
blackness a shimmer of light a bold star
is emblazoned on the dusty no I guess
yet attractive menu appears to beautiful
it's a text adventure
- beautiful ponies accompany the text
Pony Helen the menu button holds such
promise start game says one option says
the other credits say they'll do crits
about your filter one name stands out
among the rest you return to the main
menu with a newfound appreciation for
developers the menu button holds such
promise look yeah I mean should we go to
options yes sure this is great a vast
array of options are displayed before
you and aliasing cheerful facade
advanced RNG free ticket advanced RNG we
had that before then we do it yeah I
want a free ticket
so nice
back it's just our game I guess
well try advance RNG
you click the option it beeps okay but
nothing happens
obscure options that was in the other
whatever wasn't yeah alright well we got
a free ticket ok the menu button holds
such promise start games as one yes oh
oh we have to go into the options mm-hmm
of course we do
what don't you just do exit click on one
of those other folders and the recycle
banner there are other things we could
have done yeah I just happen to have
picked this one first what's um what's
uh just pedal around here a little bit
longer
how do we do what are you trying to try
to make a tiny axe an asterisk
hold on shift yeah I still gonna need
anything I want you to snowman snowman
okay maybe in

okay the menu button hold such promises
try exit is there an exit well I don't
know
nope
just start instead of Sergei
yeah something in the options did start
game good miss bolts and I was our typo
maybe
there's something in the options that
were missing that we did not do anti
aliasing or cheerful facade yet so I
will try cheerful facade fix Start menu
Oh or maybe fix dart mania
peeps but what did it - ah yes okay
this is all the stuff we have to do
telegin says rlm should attend Glasgow
Comic Cons Scotland I mean why not also
well best of the worst do an animated
special since you had the Christmas tree
on the last of this probably not why is
everybody so big on us doing an animated
episode I don't know I know you know
what we've talked about this before
works like a lot of our jokes come from
the low production quality yes and
there's only so many things you can say
about animation before you're repeating
the same thing over and over again so
start oh you know like we will probably
have more animated stuff but not just an
animated unless we can find the three oh
it is a well programmed loading screen
it looks very quickly very quickly the
game is loaded and you are a pony a
beautiful son Kate approaches do you
jump shoot or do nothing jump you leap
majestically over that gate but another
gate approaches jump
you clear the gate and land running but
now an enemy approaches oh oh we
definitely shoot lasers pore from your
mouth and fire at the enemy obliterating
it another gate appears oh it looks like
it might be little too far away oh okay
I know to get closer
it looks jump above this we've gotten
here we've gotten to the twist you jump
over it and feel smart for waiting at
all shimmering flag post approaches jump
didn't matter your neck breaks it's okay
you are no longer that Pony an explosion
of confetti announces your success you
gain nine million experience and reach
level 1000 surrender your soul now to
enable graphics that's great that was
great
what was that oh it was the text base
yeah
have you considered doing awful
Christian movies for best of the worst
loving the bad man Left Behind series we
have a couple we want to avoid it I
think you know that would be the smart
call but we've never made this smart
unless it's just there's something
really bizarre or horribly made if it's
just like a bland Christian movie that
says stupid things that first movies say
yeah less interested we have one that we
have one sitting on the shelves and it's
about like rock and roll corrupting a
kid that I hear is pretty good bad yeah
but we're more interested in bad
filmmaking right than just something
that's cheesy maybe
hey I can't tell you how upset I am that
I missed kin and Christmas best of the
worst you should be upset you should be
very upset I watched that episode and
was just livid that I did not see Chuck
Norris oh my god oh this is different oh
my god
lark almost all those Christian movies
are just playing stuff right you know
what I I personally I am interested in
seeing left behind just because just
because of its name really right like
have you ever seen left behind I've seen
it I know the gist I understand what
it's about
yeah
most of the jokes would just end up
being misconstrued as being anti
religious just don't bother that's that
would be the smart choice interest your
soul or supples to play as the pony this
one isn't going to work either
our only option is to keep trying okay
oh I definitely need to do we need to do
an eel bream an evening with bream like
just all meal brain I don't know if we
could handle it to tell you the truth
maybe it's better to dole it out I don't
know we don't plan ahead really so much
to the downfall well it acts me so much
that we don't plan ahead but I
understand it makes perfect sense
what is happening we're in 3d that's
great how much would we have to pay to
get that raw footage of that comedy best
of the work that you guys scrapped
that's a that's a question for Mike and
Jay they hold all the footage my my
guess is quite a bit because it was like
I said it wasn't like there was nothing
controversial or like exceptionally bad
about the edited land he was just boring
so you wouldn't want it because it was
boring all you would see us is like be
frustrated that we can't make jokes at
this it wasn't a comedy episode by the
way we were watching comedies
we weren't never the one of a scrapped
wasn't it I don't remember you know what
it's been too long I don't remember
insert yourself now to upgrade to 4d you
this is it my friend
the last score file get past the daemon
and delete it you scrap to bestest oh
yeah a long I mean a long time ago yeah
how long it was oh it was a while ago
and it wasn't funny or entertaining and
we all knew it
right after we filmed it Mike then tried
to edit it and nothing funny came from
it and so it is gone forever and you
should be happy about that you should be
happy that it's gone forever
beneath the valley of ultra vixens
literally blew my mind
even harder than Double Down ooh Breen
vs. Jesus who wins trick question Breen
is Jesus there's like two Memorial days
ago yeah it was a it was a while ago
might have been two years ago want more
cannon movies that's right now I want
more cannon movie bestsellers so I can
watch them goddamn it
Asmodeus as a motet what if keyboard
okay Asmodeus AS mo de us us yeah
you can't quite convince yourself to
start watching the expanse now say
something disgusting
what no wrong answer for this one say
something disgusting mmm-hmm
say something vile close enough close
enough like I said no wrong answer
you see this is that really dick neutral
or is that the game probably not
probably not probably neither wait typed
that phrase for me I miss it no I don't
know we were distracted we were
distracting his we were distracted by
neutral shenanigans
oh no that's not dick neutral look what
the hell yeah I didn't I didn't think it
would be you think that's the game it's
it's an imposter
no it's an imposter on Steam it's not
that dick neutral no I think that's the
game fucking with you no it came up
right after we said that and then he
goes low lol fuck my cock I think that's
the game fucking with us type that for
cuz you don't you never have that stuff
on right no new messages if I'm gonna be
as dick neutral though huh why would it
be dick nurture just took one of your
random friends just took a random friend
that is totally a fucked up thing that
the game does I bet I bet I bet I bet I
think it might be right all right go
back to the game go back to the gym oh
oh wait it's not up on that why I turn
off okay no it's not I'm hearing no oh
that's okay oh oh we lost
like I said no wrong answer see he came
back but I can say that your concept of
disgust varies gently from mine
did someone hack you just to type a
phrase for me just a phrase just the
phrase infernal prove to me that see
it's the distractors to distract us
today you're still paying it is the game
that's great type that phrase infernal
you know Bernal is that a spell infernal
yeah sure okay that's weird that's great
but now okay I'm gonna keep watching no
matter what apologize to your friend
