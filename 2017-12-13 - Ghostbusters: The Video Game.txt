got that stuff by now nothing to worry
about most kitchens have self-starting
okay hike area everything but the
kitchen sink
a little hard to come by then you've got
to grab by a ton steam it's actually
very easy to come by
hidden stuff
no no hidden stuff there
yes boring-ass purge solo stream I
apologize ahead of time for not talking
but that's that's why I'm playing
ghostbusters
so Bill Murray can talk for me but I
know I'm missing something I know for a
fact I'm missing something
it's a collectable around here somewhere
you know I thought that guy said
Rodriguez our Mitzvah
would it kill him is it not on steaming
it won't you know I'm gonna take backup
blast them until these days and then
throw your capture stream on they might
have taken this off steam I don't know
why they would
good good that's it buddy
gotta breathing
you'll be able to put his sorry figure
into the trash
perfect perfect that's a big WOW I don't
teach that pitiful good sacked
assignment and by extension you perhaps
the place sitting disturbed that you
can't cross history you can but not
briefly if you do it too long and
there's a little explosion that knocks
you down
they did they did incorporate crossing
the streams into this what seems to be
your problem thanks to me and my new
exclusively assigned recruit here the
festivities can now proceed in an
entirely ghost-free environment so
you're welcome
and to the Rodriguez I am I can't slam
them in the trap I don't have that
upgrade yet it won't work patient
decides to join us you grab the little
spud ray we need to have a heart to
block talking this way Oh heads up your
initiation is over now give us a hand
we've got a couple of really persistent
Oh Oh goddamnit
stop hitting me trying I'm trying to
scan that ghost for the Tobin spirit
guide
fuck fuck my ass kicked
they keep they keep knocking me over
I've done better
Chris
get out of here
what do I have for
sure now what kind of terrible it was
kind of doing terrible who is going to
pay for all of this no need to worry sir
as you know the mayor wrote to office on
a strictly Pro Ghostbusters platform and
we now invoice the city directly for all
captures and eliminations and unhaunted
New York is a tourist friendly New York
no they explain it a pinch the mayor in
the city have taken out an extensive
insurance policy as well so you're
covered honestly I'm sensing some
hostility here perhaps we should just
leave the ghost here that's what you
would prefer sir no no but please be
discreet discretion is our profession
Wow where did he come from
I suppose we should go after him unless
you want to discuss it first get that go
with dr. Spangler check out the angry
fishermen now you don't suffer through
the game to get at the cutscenes because
I actually like the game I like I like
shooting at and capturing ghosts
this way where's where's Winston he'll
be showing up in the next section
section the cast rotate in and out
they're rarely all four with you at once
probably to cover for the fact that Bill
Murray only wanted to read about half of
his lines
defensively there I'm just assuming
those are gonna get up I'm trying to
kill me
there's the toaster
oh god damn and I already blasted you
that's horseshit
that was that was a close call I think
good work
are you alright nice going you might
really be the right person for this job
yes you have destroyed a significant
section of a five-star New York hotel in
just under three hours your mother and I
are so proud he's got something let's
track it down
first one I've ever seen some type of
piping for contempt of the market
animator
to itself with the material manifest
is generating a field of Attraction so
strong that it's able to be assemblage
component
look behind you
I thought it works fine at me but when
knives and forks become a big angry
giant that's really me not liking it a
lot happens every day right anybody here
from said you could make it but first
how was i eating but we had to make do
with this new specimen here
wasn't me this time I swear
pull it together right what do we have
that can stop that cheap confection rave
weren't you gonna finish up the install
of the super slammer today super slammer
sounds untested tacky and exciting I'm
in against the minions of a god that was
never the intent but in theory yes but
want wrap up this capacity has never
been used or even tried before and why
would that stop guys that don't know
anybody yeah man what are we the FDA
will have to clear a path through this
mess first
yeah I have no need to talk over the
fucking ghostbusters okay that's just
that's ridiculous
there's a new one yep moving this
residue was animating Morgan help us
Stay Puft to somehow hatchings
many minions from
well there
this section can be hard
I'll probably have him first game over
shortly
multiple class bonds FRB in bow
Hey prepare the new on trap put you on
the muon
oh yeah I'm like super slappin throw all
the ghosts you capture at the slammer
you can relinquish your hand help
no friends
now this hobo go start paying the button
you're only encouraging them Bakeman we
need to have a talk about power
I'm detecting something significant what
is that
am i hearing wings
it's not a no deathrun but i won't
complain if i don't die how's that
is it available I'm checked my upgrades
here and I haven't yet don't have it
available yet
oh wait just pick this up right away oh
all right that wasn't a bad ghost
the game didn't in play do you have your
8 sided dice with you
all right you better pick me up before
you die
across the streams
yeah that's a bad not so bad any ideas
well we're not getting through that way
now
hey cut through this alley we might be
able to hit off State Park we need to
find a way around this mess see it's
either you or Ray
I've had just about enough of the
marshmallow curry
let's go see if we can find us a
shortcut get with me spooky and
clothesline fresh well on the score of
this game

leaking gas all over the place that is a
serious safety hazard man I wanted to
test these first but some wanted to test
these first but some wanted to test
these first but some wanted to test
these
