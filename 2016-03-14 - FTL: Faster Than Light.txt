place
so whatever yeah no I uh I am now mobile

playing I was hearing noises that I
didn't expect to hear them it's very
jarring very jarring okay is FTL visible

failure a FTL no pause run so that'll go

it the Osprey the Federation Cruiser I
kind of want Stefan what I know cuz I'm
gonna no pause run maybe that's boring

much
but I've had a lot of luck with this
ship this this simple simple unassuming
ship and I got some names yeah I got
names of people with pizza rolls and you
know what I'm just gonna pick them as I
see them cuz I see the same names pop up
all the time and not that I don't
appreciate you guys whisper the love

connections than most people's I'm just
gonna whoever I see handsome Rob has a
pizza roll handsome Rob will be this
this wonderful woman of color here we're
here we're here we get and then there's
suma gets handsome bro oh well I'm
pretty sure who's handsome Rob the

of someone someone who's a mod or
something let me know what's going on
with with with starting a movie I'll
sink everyone I'll do a countdown or
something I don't know
yes took a screenshot that's not bad
advice Tiberius Kirk that's not bad
advice but I'm doing later all tapping
and looking around with words saved I
don't know I don't know maybe I'll just
randomly look at names and not spell
them right you know all right well
somebody somebody shouted me what are
you ready to watch zodiac or just start
a movie without me on your own okay it's
fine if everything's fine I'm gonna die
while playing up deal horribly Oh
ship ship name suggestions suggestions
this will also be the the official name
of my car who's who's got a suggestion
on the ship name doomed doomed you know
what
oh the Damned oh I like the Damned the
Damned
my car is now called the Damned and I
love it I love it
but I spelled Damned wrong because I'm
an idiot
somebody tell me if I spelled Damned
wrong because I'm an idiot
yeah well it's fine you know what it's
all fine two M's I put two M's in there
as they're not supposed to be two M's
that's fine
wait okay uncool aid man since 1em 1em
1em it's only one em somebody else is
saying too but I'm seeing more people
saying one em so I'm going with one
that looks weird that looks weird
why does it look weird I'll take it on
faith wait I don't think anything on
faith I'm just you know what though
I don't take things on faith but I'm too
lazy to double check so 1m there is no
1m all right normal because I'm not
completely suicidal no God and the way
we go paused Oh No
why did it start paused my no pause run
has already been ruined it's already
been ruined I don't know what to do
because I have to have to unpause this
there we go there we go I hit the pause
button once but to be fair I had to
you're in a my engine some juice my
burst laser some juice make them a
priority D power the medbay and power
the Rockets cuz nobody's sick just yet
engines guns and shields that's where I
want my crew and OH
store first first thing off well that's
just like a that's just like a fuck you
fuck you look at all this shit you can't
buy that's what it means when one your
first jump you see a storm in FTL
Oh we'll go to the distress beacon hey
Jack I see your type of things in the
chat I know that's Jack because I'm not
typing things you don't need me to read
this shit we all know we all know the
FTL so you don't need me to read this
shit all right I don't know why oh no no
I don't have all right see this right
here is why I like using the Osprey
because this right here is a really
common event and one of the blue options
is for an ng crew member the osprey
starts with an NG crewmember and a rock
man and a mantis you you get a lot of
blue options just by starting with the
osprey um it promised he'll simply fire
on it from a distance oh no fire a few
volleys but they aren't able to
penetrate the defense system shields
weapons have no trouble piercing yours
well well great well great we're off to
a wonderful start wonderful start oh no
oh no I've damaged everywhere damage
everywhere everybody fix the ship open
them doors open them doors you're gonna
suffocate
I don't even have a good mouse pad I'm
doing this no pause no no decent mouse
pad I'm insane why am i insane go back
to your stations
right free shit free shit not bad - two
stores and I ever have next to no cash
that's that's just bullshit as bullshit
is what that is
I know there's no game audio I thought
everybody was gonna watch a movie
tonight
because I interrupted movie dicks
tonight vote everybody vote if you want
game audio or if you'd rather hear a
movie when a movie starts I'm willing to
I'm willing to go either way on that I
don't really care it's all fine
I'm saying three three game audio's game
audio's game audio game game alright
I'll do the turn the game audio up I'm
heading over there right now are you
ready a stupid piece of paper I'm using
a clipboard as a mousepad and I have
notes from the last review we did on the
clipboard and I don't think that piece
of paper makes a great mousepad it seems
to be better without so I'm or as Oh
boobs that shouldn't mean that shouldn't
be nothing FTL it's not too loud
is that too loud how's that audible
am i using the compressor everything is
plugged in jack and the lights are on so
I would say that yes I am using the
compressor
I hear a hiss well the hiss is the the
compressor and the new compressor is
important because when I say oh my god
in theory that keeps me from blowing out
everybody's eardrums
oh you know you know what I'm a weirdo
and I might actually have the music in
the game off we had options options damn
here yeah see how's that
still no audio even if right after I
turn this up it's still quite low
fucking fucking the brakes are off
now you're gonna tell me now you can
tell me it's terrible in two out good
all right I'm seeing some Goods there
will be more a police quest - but
that'll be when Jack is around rich why
don't you have a Twitter account what
the fuck would I do with a Twitter
account not some kind of narcissistic
weirdo who has to has to have a force
everybody to listen to some stupid 12
character long thing I said every 40
minutes
all right uh rebel Scout all right it's
gonna be our first battle with no
pausing now oh god it's so end I mean
the defend the outpost first last year
take I take out their weapons I think
they have no weapons bar why are you
paused I did not cause the it must have
paused automatically because I hit
escape oh that's obnoxious I know I
undergirded the room I was good at
Target
now I'm pausing and so this will be
legit now alright I'm gonna take some
damage because of that oh that sucks hey
I wanted yeah we're fine I think auto
fire is gonna be my friend
oh they got a fucking repair bot those
jerks oh wait you just got that one gun
oh he can't do jack shit that's fine
Jackie are you watching this this is uh
this is the first sector right off the
bat two stores before I can build up any
kind of money
to stores straight away can you believe
that shit jack is awful oh fuck well
fuck my nutsack
damned damned I tell you damned oh and
you miss I got fires I got I got a
handle fires without pausing or oxygen
or weapons or weapons I have I have
nothing I have none of the things I need
to survive
fucking hacking my fourth fucking jump
I'm fighting fucking hacking that's
that's some bullshit
well that fucker up
boarding John it's not worth that shit
I know that I want to fuck around with a
boarding strategy without pausing that
seems like a recipe for dead crew
members dead and lost crew members
jump
how do you like your RTS rich dead I
like my RTS dead we have some cash to
play with
fuck yeah i won i won fucking scrap
recovery arm but a fucker fuck yeah fuck
motherfucking fuck fuck yeah
how do I feel about possible RTS still
don't like them it's not the same thing
don't beat that
I do not have any what do you keep
blowing up my health ships the stupid
ships as you killed that fucker
have I upgraded my PC since I've built
it no I don't really need to do it's
still a pretty decent PC it still runs
everything I've thrown at it
oh I'm fine actually
now you're gonna bother taking out their
weapons shields and shields and steering
man cuz this drum ship is just stupid
stupidly designed drum ship
why am I so good at games rich what
tells me I'm terrible again I know what
you're talking about what is the name of
my machine it's called computer actually
you know what
I think I did name it blinky blinky
shadow which is the red ghost name in
pac-man
name and nickname
we have time to get that quest problem
yeah we're in that civilian ship power
up and engage the pirates
rich why do I think the next-gen movies
are so flawed because they're dumb
action films and they're not story
centric to Star Trek The Next Generation
stories which are about diplomacy and
discovery instead of a blow-up the thing
gotta shoot those people and blow up the
thing stay down you fucking weapon room
I'm aboard you boring human who we have
to name right ship crew all right
I've just been picking random names
today anyone with pizza roll and first
name I'm looking at us taco salad
Tuesdays congratulations you're going to
die
Tuesday I can't put the YS on the end
see your taco salad Tuesday
congratulations your babes were changed
you're not the pilot you are your
sensors man make sensors because frankly
I don't think shields are all that
important they retread recharge fast
enough
they're fast enough
damn add damn at all
no question yeah why why is the exit so
far forward why why is that
you know I mean this the sector was
designed for me to have a minimum number
of jumps I'm not cool with that I'm
really not cool with that next sector so
what's going on you guys you guys still
launching a movie or just a movie even
can someone let me know I'll call out a
start time I'll do a countdown
rich did I've romance anyone in Mass
Effect yeah Ashley because she was the
most well-rounded character
sticks
none of the characters in the second
mass effect while they were interesting
characters I never thought any of them
were good love interest in the first
game there were fewer options I
genuinely do like Ashley Williams
character not not Ashley Williams of
Evil Dead
but Ashley women Ashley Williams female
last kicking soldier it was either her
or the Arab and the hours like this
weird puppy dog who instantly falls in
love with you and she's creepy as hell
can't Stanley Hara I don't I don't think
there was a third option unless you're
playing as a girl but then either way
you only had two options
whatever whatever
why was my my hate for Mass Effect 3
start at the second game at start of the
third game ii had a horrendous plot well
ii didn't did ii focused on the
characters and there were good
characters there was lots of interesting
things in the second game lots of great
world building it wasn't a great second
part of a trilogy ho is is ultimately
the problem and you're you're wrong
was it denílson hummer liara is very
much creepy she's creepy she's like a
puppy dog she's like a humanoid puppy
dog who wants to have sex with you and
I'm I'm not into puppy dogs so I wasn't
into Liara I swear to God I think her
father was a puppy dog you don't know
anything about Mass Effect technically
that is possible
she's a weird alien and they didn't have
sex with anything so I think her father
was a puppy dog
yes Liara was the blue one with the
squid hair oh we're not sending anybody
over to slavers fuck no fuck that shit
we're gonna get blown to pieces what
we're gonna do
yes yes take that shield down
I'm getting I'm getting some hard-ass
shit early on it's not fair it's not
fair or right
yes I'll accept your offer I want that
mantis man urban vermin you are now the
Mantis men because I'm just picking
people randomly today that that takes
internet connection is completely out of
the equation does the pause count of the
menu is up no it's just pauses in battle
come on come on game automatically
pauses when there's dialogue going on
check out that beacon is FTL good yes
FTL is very good it doesn't very
difficult like insanely difficult I'm
afraid to play on hard
hey all right oh I almost want to get a
teleporter now because mantis and rock
man oh they make a great boarding party
I don't want to do it no pause though
with with with with teleporters that
just seems like like problems waiting to
happen and see who will this be don't
remember naming too many people laughter
wickless before so it's gonna be wet
las'
why don't you like to pause I love to
pause but the whole thing is that the
challenge is not pausing your Rockman so
you're gonna you're gonna man shields or
maybe sensors and doors and you're gonna
mansions oh wait I got a I got a mantis
who's not doing anything
Rockman is gonna be shields
cuz he's slow shields are more
centralized see I'm thinking I'm
thinking yes it is sub only for
neighborhood
Academy and I gotta be hidden benefits
being a sub love us subs the great
sometimes sometimes we open up the non
subs we're not we're not completely
we're not complete dub Nazis I'm not
Nazis at all really
like like never basically never anon see
that's the only right answer never a
Nazi tax slaver scum that's the only
right answer and get mauled by their
flak
all right I like that I like that no
wait not piloting check out the shields
yes die
maude should get a few names to they
almost never get pick I don't know
that's true they would name odds plenty
of times but you know what I'll name a
mod who wants it
who wants which mod wants this this this
mantis ma'am oh I'm getting so many good
boarding type guys I should morally I
should go with a boarding strategy but
that's that's a recipe for death
mr. Schine smile mr. shott smile it is
as capital what a saying is it is now
why not actually it's not
look I'm not very observant that's the
thing about me
second always tech not getting anywhere
an FTL by not attacking
and he plans to do stuff with Dark Souls
3 when it comes out
probably mana
investigate the station always right we
need some repairs now when I need a
store you know what I'm not gonna find a
store I will now not find a store
how is my pie a well-rounded
did you get it did I did a good thing
all right you're ready you're ready for
the movie now I'm not ignoring you I'm
playing I'm playing a game all right
everyone wanted to watch zodiac before I
was going to do my cousin better now you
know I'm Monday is kind of an off night
and I'm sure people came in when they
got some kind of tweet email
notification thing I started I don't
know chat likes to get together and
watch movies on off days Mondays I guess
everyone watches a quality movie as
opposed to a laughably bad movie and
before I showed up my secret stream
everyone was gonna watch the zodiac so
you know I'm not gonna interrupt
anybody's fun you're gonna you're gonna
watch the movie I'm into a countdown and
then everyone's gonna hit play on their
copy of the movie that they legally own
or have rented from amazon.com I'm gonna
I'm just gonna keep playing FTL
I actually don't own zodiac so it's fine
it's all fine all right I'm gonna calm
down I'm going to do the way oh now now
now it's now it's postponed oh no oh no
all right nobody's watching anything
nobody's watching anything I'll tell you
what it's my fuckin secret stream I'll
do what I want one movies do I own cuz I
can watch two and I can watch to it what
do I have
I'm fond of
things
oh yeah second here don't throw
something doing something watch that
recently ooh maybe
hmm Fight Club
if we watch beetlejuice
fuck it I'm gonna say Fight Club
Beetlejuice or nobody got one if I got
Fight Club Beetlejuice or Iron Man 3
pick your poison chat
Fight Club Beetlejuice or Iron Man 3
alright somebody set up a straw poll
Sam's I'm seeing in the islands it's not
overwhelming it's not too overwhelming
so we're gonna set up a straw poll I'm
gonna I'm gonna keep playing FTL Furnham
few minutes then we'll see what straw
poll says so somebody set up straw poll
say now it's paused here but I'm out in
combat it doesn't really matter
make a pause because I alt-tab I had no
control over that pause next jump
Oh store for heal all right good I don't
wanna don't want to get out of this
nebula too quick we're gonna explore a
bit on this nebula but we know we can
get to a store that's good
de-stress them back
fuck fuck fuck fuck
looks that oxygen
you'd get on air
open the doors
that fire should be out
and I could do oh that was disastrous
just disastrous
scrap the company on weapon pre igniter
I can't afford the one greenlighter I
would love the weapon pre igniter oh do
I still not have oxygen oh shit thank
you for telling me thought I did
scrap scrap you can't so crew not but i
would anyway that's just just Stevie
we'd start upgrading components
damn damn
it'll do for now
see I need I really need here's what's
here's why I'm stopping I'm thinking
here
you can't sell as far as I know you
can't sell crewmembers and I don't want
to do that anyway I couldn't do that I
desperately need to start upgrading this
crap down here or any betting shields
I need engines I need to expand on my
weapons I also need to repair and it's
like do I hang on to scrap or do i
repair and I think I'm gonna repair now
that I got look at I got crap worth pre
igniting anyway but it's fine
whatever I think inspired man in civil
war trailer if you want a more thorough
discussion about that load up the last
stream I did what Jack the police quest
one from yesterday there's gonna be a
blank to your discussion about it I like
it the eyes look good good classic John
Romita scene your eyes
none of the mechanical stuff bothers me
in the eyes Peter Parker is going to
have he's going to build that himself in
Tony Stark's lab that's my prediction
so to still be costume built by Peter
but it'll it won't be like he just a
nerdy kid built it in his basement and
I'll be he built it using a super
geniuses lab so though they'll make
Peter seem smart without making him
super genius and the costume will still
be his and that's why it's it's cheesy
spider-man costume but not something
like that ass like stark would design
that's also why he's gonna call it
underoos
I like it
all right way oh I have you know what in
the pilot scene that would be why you
know I better save these positions
Rockman you were my you're my shield guy
and that's your positions every one two
three one two three doesn't matter I
guess I'll go down
love to upgrade my weapons give it a
heavy ion in the plate shake out
take out everything of theirs ship Oh
get that rocket launcher I eat them I
hate them oh I hate them so much
what about what about my med babe I want
to be healing in the middle of this
fight
of course you know what I mean
Minos of me means
all right I just have to hope these
these doubles is this double with a
freaking call because I Alzheimer's
scrap scrap arms make up for a lot of my
my current scrap deficiencies
now you're injured
all right so what was the result of the
straw poll what movie won
click on the straw poll
has open open the URL that's why I
clicked on it Betelgeuse is one I have
no interest in backstroke of the West
I've I've seen enough prequel movies to
last me a lifetime
a flippin lifetime plus I don't have it
why did you add that in there you you
people you people
all right it's free on the internet
watch watch it we'll watch it it won it
won the straw poll it shouldn't even
have been on but fine crazy people
you're crazy people
ling-ling do it and it better be free

under the Godfather or something Jesus
Christ Jesus Christ whom I don't believe

don't believe in alright y'all got like
y'all got like a minute to find the
movie and queue it up you got like a
minute

fine it's fine
well I'm gonna be honest with you I'm
gonna be so busy playing FTL the movies
gonna be like like somewhere in the side
it's gonna be in like the bottom 10% of
my brain is gonna be occupied with the
movie I'm gonna be be worried about
dodging laser bolts so it's all fine
everyone is ready I'm assuming everyone
is ready time has been had speak now or
forever hold your peace I see no one
speaking so I'm gonna start start a
countdown I know this is the way it's
gonna be a Long Beach countdown okay so
I see somebody say wait all right so on
go 20 21
oh wait that's it's counting the wrong
way 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 oh I see
so this is one moment that's why I had a
Long Count
that's why I had a long come around
there wait
everyone's gonna wait for you uh
residual Mack everyone's waiting for you
everyone everyone in the stream like
Gigi does that mean Gigi rich does does
that mean you're ready
I'm going to assume GG means you're

game using barrows easy he's busy
okay I am now resuming the countdown
unless somebody else no you get it you
get it again
dad on go
twelve eleven ten nine eight seven six
five four three two one go motherfucker
bitch pants thing all right there you go
there you go
have you don't understand the movie just
watch play up deal that's fine
airings fine make sure my sounds down
over help cuz just everybody speaking
Chinese right now I guess there's some
comedy value would people saying things
you you can't understand but the the
comedy is coming from these subtitles as
I understand it so you know I need some
and that way we can actually I can
actually put this stream up on YouTube
later like archiving things so my
marathon streams will be lost forever me
as I was listening to movies Oh what are
we got fuel for drones fuck yeah fuel
for droids no no they're drones and it
paused again without my consent this
game keeps keeps keeps shitting on my
menopause running down here and then up
to the exit yes I want to get that
storage cache
and shoot him oh no I don't have my
Rockets ready what my heavy ions
I need upgrade shit oh you know what I
kind of can I've got 80 some I'm doing
good scrap thanks to thanks to my dual
scrap arms and because it's no pause I'm
going with you no auto fire and I don't
think that's good for Rockets you
Rockets need to be managed because of
fuel an FTL stream but nearly 350
viewers well you know it's an off night
it's fine it's an off night unplanned
stream let them wake up realize they
missed a stream and weep Oh God
Star Wars Episode three just looking at
it just looking at it it's not a thing
you want to do
oh nice 31 scrapped for nothing
everything's coming up millhouse they've
paid for themselves
all right all right well doing some
shipbuilding here
oh did I miss out on the Zoltan home
worlds now I feel dumb now I feel dumb I
was thinking I I was just looking at
whether or not it was red or green
because green is good if you have lots
of spare scrap because you can buy
things and right now I just spent all my
scrap that I'll fight things but if I
missed my chance I had the super shields
I feel like an idiot hey you know why
whatever it's fine
ow fuck
oh fuck you gonna get mauled fuckin a
rocket launcher oh thank goodness
hammer that thing to pieces
one ship has one rocket launcher has
taken off 1/3 of my fucking ships health
and I want all of these people to die
until they're so dead they can't die
anymore no I'm not gonna accept your
surrender I'm blowing you to bits
oh that sucks
all right
this is why that I know everyone's
watching the movie now that's fine but
that is why normally I invest in engines
before I invest in shields and I didn't
this time I don't know why but engines
are good because you can actually dodge
fucking missiles and you can shields
don't do shit for missiles texts Jack
wants to know something that could be
wrong and I'm gonna take off or saying
all right what's up
who did what now
I assume Jack was texting me that was my
I heard my phone go off when I checked
it he's getting my quick hogs has him up
the carpet this is Jack in the chat
again somebody someone was talking to
Jack yeah
time to continue on our adventure
all right no muscles on this ship so I'm
not getting quite as screwed Jango lost
lost third on my friggin health and one
one fucking one fucking missile launcher
more than the ship take their shields

trouble with the the stream

crew here all right
I'll kill that fucker kill that fucker
kill that fucker kill that fucker
yeah
do we have an energy
alright Chet what do you think
yeah I think ng I mean I could have a
kick-ass boarding crew but I'm not gonna
go with a boarding strategy anyway so ng
ng it is alright Who am I to look over
at Ches 87
yeah I need better weapons oh wait no
doesn't waste that's a waste don't yep
take out his fucking weapons
I've got an NG and I'm not using it you
know why because I can't Plus Oh Shh
this heavy ions crap

Oh God well that's a joy
if I could sell this heavy ion because
it's a piece of crap
now
yeah
sorry
you need flak cannons
now you help with out of the fire
alright alright
I mean I could be doing better on scrap
and upgrades but you know ships holding
together and they'll cost me a shitload
of money to fix it
no he's died
I could I could stand to make some more
of these shots
where's my ng you gonna fix that fix
that
do that thing miss miss miss oh fuck
this Lacy's not doing much damage
missmiss
one hits the shield the other to miss oh
god this is gonna take forever I'm
targeting the wrong thing here
check out those fucking engine service
piloting or something Oh
three fucking energies they're gonna
just fix everything immediately they're
obnoxious
thank you for giving up sleep to watch
me give really boring quiet solo stream
Len listen ski that's very kind of you
as soon as I can ditch this fucking
heavy ion the better I don't like it
fires too slow and misses too much
and I want you to die I'm really fond of
thought of you dying I'm not accepting
your surrender
fights like this are wide trouble
kinsman it's not playing FTL oh this
hardly ever happens
we're almost there just two more hits no
no that was three misses it was exactly
what we didn't need yeah how long has
this been going on everybody's super
leveled up I'm not grinding
oh thank Christ 41 scrap I'll take it
ship ship
I probably want ya
all those great engines are shut down oh
nice nice
all right
I was gonna be tricky to use no pause
very tricky
oh fuck just fuck everything
I heard running
I'll give it one volley
all right I don't like this hell bird
but no pause that's not gonna work
yeah I don't like it at all fuck
- missus

shields
I hated doing that I hated skipping that
I need some good weapons
yeah
it's good for now
oh shit
hey she's no curbed room ship I usually
don't but in this situation halberd is a
great weapon but without pausing and two
four five six seven eight
no I'd rather have the scrap we're full
on crew
good that worked out great
yes F press f for slave respect I killed
them all because I'm horrible I killed
them all for 69 scrap that's all they
were worth to me
you never tried drones on the boss how
does that work I have no fucking idea
I'll take that
not accept surrender no
all right this isn't bad I could work
with this
yeah I'll make veteran no no I'm a drone
slave see the downside of going going
with drones is that they require mo you
did you need drones to use the drones
and I'm gonna need to spend a lot of a
lot of money just buying drones yeah
I'll take that I need to scrap I need
the fuel actually that's what I meant to
say
kill them kill them
right I don't think anybody died good
what kind of what kind of evil AI who
during an ion storm without an enemy
ship would leave full powers the shield
but suddenly de power my oxygen kind of
kind of horrible AI would do that ship
ship was run by hell it's fucking run by
hell
it's fine alright go go get out of here
get out of this fucking shithole
next sector a civilian

defense drone for this particular run I
am using drones more than I usually do
which is hardly ever
fucking hacking sucks
are you powered you don't need to be
powered you're not doing anything for me
come on come on get through
it'll be no no there would be nothing
morally wrong with you if you turn this
off and finish watching part was to a
fleece cuesta or wonderfully sequester
whatsoever please quest to part you are
watching you can watch that and said
it's fine it's all fine rich so those
streams can be boring affairs where I
talked to myself if at all so I get it
all right
who wants to join the damned uh what he
got here recede looking for a rookie
named huggy snuggle
welcome aboard the Damned
all right you go here what are your
talents yeah you can hang out in the
engine room
your man you run back up pal
yeah
fast fast fast
yep
now just one jump Wow
whoo all right upgrade
I'm going to avoid the Mantis homeworld
just because I don't want to deal with
boarding I definitely don't want to deal
with boarding
and you know what you can you can
protect the drones cuz I don't know what
else you can do oh wait now your sensors
man your your sensors man because my
previous sensors man died well I didn't
know what was happening
jump
yeah we're low on fuel there's not much
I can do about that but get lucky
there yeah
oh flak flak forgot about my flak
yeah okay don't I keep it in there
mr. shy smile says rich just been
confirmed it's just been confirmed that
Conroy and Hamill are in The Killing
Joke great now The Killing Joke is a
must-buy and by the way for fuel I'm
accepting that
damn
that's a wasted jump there but worth it
I need the fuel source worth that I need
the fuel
oh I can't I can't I just can't
it wouldn't make any sense no my setups
working too good
I can't it wouldn't make any sense chat
right it wouldn't make any sense
who needs ions those ions are working
for me those ions are taking shit down
I'll tell you what oh no oh oh fuck fuck
no those those two ions together are
really mulling things Balkan takes
everything down after 50 minutes Hogan's
got some flaws I'm more I'm more
inclined to selling the burst laser too
and the flak and then getting the Vulcan
so that would probably be crazy
what I have is working
ah shit we're staying the course
we're staying the course staying the
course
oh I can't undo a prank it's fine
all right here we go there we go I on
the fuck out of their shields
yeah yeah Vulcans would not have done
that
at least not many murders quickly
yeah
oh this is stressful
get your ass over there
and you suck at repairing things but
help out help out
ah
that was a nasty one
yeah
yeah
all right free shit
I could use one of the I figured what's
called that that battery kind of station
that gives you extra power they're not
gonna get it ooh next best thing
so chap are you sure that defense drone
one is better than defense drone two
this to fire faster though
what I'm looking at is these guys like
to I have to dismiss somebody on the
crew I think that just has to happen I
need his ol time
I need a Zoltan I want them both
