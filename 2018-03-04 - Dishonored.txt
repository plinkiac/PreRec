[Part I]
should we should be on Zen even having
any any problems with the stream is
everything cool is everything good
everything working hello
I've got dishonored here I absolutely
fucking love Dishonored I am absolutely
in love with this game right now and
we're gonna have we're gonna have a nice
quiet rich solo stream because I'm I'm
totally gonna get lost in this game I
know cam well yeah there's a good reason
though this this game much much like
thief is best played in the dark and I
could turn the camera on but you
wouldn't be able to see shit the camera
is black is the camera still trying to
to show up and double-check that are you
still trying oh you're still trying to
show up Thanks there you go
hang a fixed totally fixed alright I'm
I'm going to warm up by embarrassing
myself with the combat I'd totally do my
best to play this game stealthily
so just have you know a well-rounded
game because I'm constantly playing the
main story stuff as I can
fearless still I'm gonna do maybe this
is some combat just just to be
well-rounded man no end of the breach
end of the breach is great but currently
dishonored is my gym
my screens a little bit dark I think I
think I can deal with that someone's
down I know you're somewhere around
say um this is about as much as I'm
gonna be talking what motors this is the
dunwall City trials this particular one
is the alley street boy it's going to be
bad I hate those dogs
Oh is another dog where's it at maybe I
can kill the one come here come here I'm
gonna kill you stop you know the combat
engine of this despite the fact that I'm
trying to play the games the stealth as
I can
the combat engine in this kind of great
just disappear we know you're here link
me yeah die motherfucker don't you got
game what you've got
yes anybody thinking of playing this why
I love this game I wanted to play this
when it came out my computer wasn't
quite up to it I got it
fairly early on but I was getting like
20 frames a second
where's my mouse pad
my aim always seems weird when I play
here at the studio I think this mouse
pad is just awful
yes rich solo Jack is ill
all right you're doing okay ish I'd like
to maybe have another help file when I
find you it's going bad good rats oh you
can summon enough swarms of rats and
literally eat people alive and it's the
coolest fucking thing fucking corpse
I wouldn't push this guy over the ledge
but I just hit him over I don't have the
power for that yet
what's got it is that that my hands not
be restless reveal yourself
give yourself up come out both know
you're weak at home
I didn't want to up you keep going
stop like see you
nope no into the bridge
I like into the breach I also like the
solder
missed I missed bedtime to miss
Cowboys I love the tallboys there
they're a great visual and they're kind
of fun to fight
goddess
No
don't kill the corpse but the organ
grinder
he's my kryptonite
oh you're stuck in there you might be
impossible to kill ever
that would suck if I get stuck on wave
fucking 12
dog
that guy's music box blocks off my magic
powers
sees he's bad news
can you get unstuck
where'd he go Oh oh no I'm at Wave 12 of
the 13 waves and I'm fucked
he's glitched in there no no
oh right at the end
I think his legs are invulnerable
time to play into the bridge uh fuck
into the breach why do you people deny
me my good time why
I can't really shoot with these slits
he's not actually there
what can I do it blow em out
now try to shoot his feet all right I'm
pretty sure they're invaluable
hello
oh well huh so do i retry this as actual
feet
all right well try shooting this actual
feet
and now I'm completely out of ammo now
that a method of matters anyway
hello fuck it fuck it
he's pretty good pretty good entrapped I
had that happen once before all right
I'll start a new game Springs a little
bit dark I'm gonna I'm gonna crank up
the brightness a bit for me I don't know
how it's showing up for you on this TV
it's a bit dark
all right
ah I think I got a normal save I'm good
III like into the breach I haven't
played it I'm gonna put a bid
I haven't played into the breach to
completion though Corvo if only there
was someone else I trusted to send so
that you could remain near but there is
no one else and the spy master was right
to insist that I send you the plague has
taken so many and we must find a cure
when you are near my heart is at peace
Emily and I will count the days until
you return hurry home and bring good
news
watch it
what kind of name is Corvo fictional
fantasy universe name this this doesn't
take place in any kind of Earth history
kind of dunwall tower what Corvo has
news for the Empress and we've come a
long way vaguely steampunker Suns black
magic superstition for all we know
there's a cure for the plague by now
wailing part of this world economy big
whale big goopy will monks that's
unusual we need help with the Rattler
I love the crazy world in this game yeah
I mean this game reminds me a lot of
these a lot it's the spiritual successor
to theif the mechanically have been
different I I originally tried playing
this like me and thief was very much
about hiding in the shadows this this
game does not give a flying fuck about
shadows it's all line of sight
the Empress would be waiting for your
news for though their voyage sir it's
been good traveling with you Corvo
have you ever met my niece Calista she's
getting more beautiful every year I got
feeling I'll meet her later in the game
yes yes the pressure was too low hello
sir you're back we tell me about your
trip please
were there any wheels wait let's play
hide-and-seek first I'll cover my eyes
and you hide me you have time
well there's busy talking to that nasty
old spy master yes combat is the other
big difference between this and thief
okay
combat is very much a viable strategy in
this it wasn't the evo really good it
wasn't it wasn't intended to be come on
combat and thief was intended to be a
little bit clunky and last resort
let's see if you're so good at this I'll
hide my eyes and count and at the end of
the countdown
I'll shy and find you okay I'm going to
count to ten
find a place I'd
stealth tutorial is a hide in the seat
game with the Empress's daughter it's
adorable you can you can lean around
corners standard it would spider-man
villain I've always been fond of Doc Ock
face game it's too dark in here for a
facecam I'm playing a game that you
really want to play in the dark
I beat a little girl a hide-and-seek did
you see my nanny says the big ocean is
full of them but I think she only says
that to scare me later will you show me
that TV in chokehold like you promised
I walked her mother don't you show her
that same chokehold and the intro to
Dishonored 2 - did they reference that
if you were listening to that thing she
just said welcome Lord Protector stop
moving Campbell and you Corvo
welcome back wherever you been they sent
him all around the aisles to beg for aid
a waste of time my elixir will banish
the playing from this city now keep
still a moment I overseer Campbell I'm
not so sure that painting looks like
Campbell
we saw my improvements to the water lock
see what I'm forced to paint the high
overseer is no beauty I'm sure the
Empress is eager to see you knew it was
a fool's errand Corvo the plague comes
from inside us we must all strengthen
our faith I oversee her I must ask you
to hold your pose no foreigner can save
us from the consequences of a corrupt
society no fancy elixirs either remember
to every man his choice to every man his
fate and by the way here's a cute little
thing he's painting him I'm gonna grab
the bottle what are you doing
I need the bubble to draw the eye away
from Campbell I suppose I can paint him
without the cider though in truth he is
always close to this stuff
she'll see you at once
they're sick people not criminals we've
gone beyond that question your majesty
Emily just glitched out save them from
the plague if we can all of them very
well we will not speak of this again
mother
Corvo is back thank you Emily leave us
please
as you wish your majesty
hi okay common to weird glitches tonight
in today's that doesn't usually happen
love surprises that's usual it's a fair
wind that brings you home to me what
news have you brought
emily has blink
she's already allied with the outsider
I hope that one of the other cities had
dealt with this before
knew of some cure this news is very bad
we're at the breaking point cowards
they're going to blockade us they'll
wait to see if the plague turns the city
into a graveyard are you ok mother you
seem sad yes don't worry darling mother
is fine wait where are the guards who
sent them away
Corvo thank you if you hadn't been here
not again
Corvo it's all coming apart fine find
Emily protect her you're the only one
he'll know what to do
won't you carve Oh Corvo you had one job
what a solve look at what he's done
yes he's killed the Empress
what did you do with young lady Emily
traitor her own bodyguard ironic I'll
see you beheaded for this cargo take him
I was rich resisting playing into the
breach because I am absolutely fucking
in love with dishonored this is scratch
from a thief's itch hilarious how they
automatically assumed he's guilty
who do you think's behind this shit it's
a setup sign the confession and that he
give me the rights to put your spirit at
ease
that's enough for now
get out better than Vanquish well you're
talking about apples and oranges to
think but maybe God almost certainly
empress isn't dead her daughter Emily is
hidden away and no one will ever know
the truth yes unlucky you tomorrow
you'll be executed but it's for a good
cause this country needs strong
leadership now something to guide the
weak and that's where we come in there
was nothing personal in this even though
you almost sank our plans but it turned
out well you were in the wrong place at
the right time and someone has to take
the fall
goodbye
but they come back to itself
you should eat Corvo this meal comes
from the friend trip so we're in jail
what there's something hitting under our
bread it's a key to the door all right
yeah basically is this people helping
you get out they want they want your
assistance
planning full stealth or assassin Roger
mixed I haven't finished the game for
one I'm about halfway through and people
are I'll kill sometimes I'm not I'm not
playing bloodless right social event for
the high and mighty
come see the noble Lord Protector get
his head chopped off I slaughter the
innocent guards fuck up and convention
the solitary Wing is off-limits to
maintenance this guy turns around before
I could knock him out he's gone
is this a spiritual successor to the
theme it's the it's the closest you'll
find to a spiritual successor to theme
yes
like I I was doing bad early on and this
and is honored to really cuz I I kept
trying to rely on on shadows and
dishonor doesn't really care about how
how dark you are it doesn't care if
you're hidden in shadow it cares we've
hidden behind some dignitaries
this game looks very halflife tuition I
have I have recently heard that a lot of
the guy who did art for this game who
did some design work worked on half-life
2 so that's there's probably a good
reason why you're reminded of half-life
2
hello is anyone there alright
sometimes this kind of turns around when
I'm sneaking up on and I don't know why
I'll take that coin
attention tomorrow's execution will be
restricted to the personnel assigned to
the event and approves dignitaries only
so far we're doing great
the stream has no owner that's that's
what I should have titled this dream
this stream has no honour
you like hiding people on chandeliers
what so they fall over and hurt
themselves when they wake up after you
leave how's the audio
can things good good
Mackworth your lazy slug sorry not yet I
was gonna report that boiler leak from
yesterday forget it
just do your rounds or reports trouble
for both of us
I'm moving
attention
tomorrow's execution will be restricted
to the personnel assigned to the event
and approved dignitary homeland
I'd like to get that guy's key
I just want to find a good time to sneak
up on
I fuck up here they'll be blood
I had unless accompanied by an officer
of the wall escort
huh
I didn't want to do that but I couldn't
have him alerting everyone else I feel
bad about that that man had a family
will be restricted to the personnel
assigned to the event and approved
dignitaries only let me know if you want
to take my patrol flow off
I want to make sure he can't see when I
take this guy out
almost almost undetected almost
a no deathrun I that would take too long
me to spend a whole day just playing
this
look at I'm looking at that guy in the
upstairs I'm looking at him he's turned
around now we going for the kill
nope
or the be not killed
I have a nice collection of a conscious
men what do I look like Kevin Spacey to
you
whole group of guards up there I don't
want to see me staying underwater
yeah as original only stream jackass
sick that it
Lahab Ridge steals their possessions
before choking them yeah man master
pickpocket I am so my allies have
stashed weapons for me in the sewers
watch for booby traps could be some down
here by the look of it all right if
we're lucky one of them will get Corvo
you're afraid of him he's sir Conan it's
all merchants and whores down there kids
like you you never saw what he was like
I saw him fight three two one in the
practice yard I hope it's me that finds
him I don't
I haven't watched a full-on speedrun of
this game I have seen videos of people
who are basically just fucking showing
off though added it made me feel so
awful about myself and my own skills
there's people out there who have turned
playing this game into a fucking art
form
oh man this is gonna be a perfect ghost
except for that one guy who spotted me
and I had to kill him I hate those guys
I hate that guy who made me kill sewers
are full of people by the way who have
died from the plague
still on things
do over yeah man you got to live with
your mistakes
turn over
that's to know the elixir preventive
maybe either way let's just dump them
down there go rats
I love this little puzzle you need to
get to that thing but all those rats are
there so we just throw some bodies on
the ground and that distracts the rats
which ever played this I never played
the first one my computer was too crap
when this first came out
and I had it but I was getting 20 frames
per second yeah maybe someday and
someday came
by the way there are booby traps
that's that's a tripwire there but if I
trip that I will get shot it's another
one right here so uh we're gonna disarm
the traps
now that I've played this what do I
think I'm absolutely in love with this
when was this released six years ago
what you actually do in this game
stealth
I just slid under a tripwire you know as
you do
all right this all kinds of little
there's no details they put in here my
gears are safe with some information
they give you a hint on where you can
find the combination to this safe they
hint that it's the whiskey you check
your whiskey and this is whiskey shelf
over here and you can I don't know if
you can read that if it's too dark
thirty numbers four or five one
I might like Splinter Cell I had thought
that Splinter Cell was more linear like
metal here where there's certain ways
she's supposed to get around things and
it's not really that open like a thief
or a Dishonored
you won't get past me you know I'll try
to but I've heard someone say that
splinter cell's bit more like thief so
maybe I'll try to make a lot I'll give
it a shot
knock something over if you can bastard
did we kill this guy it's probably safer
to kill him honestly smells like a
deadly bird here yeah I did it why would
you kill him uh easier less chance of
alerting the other guard not getting out
this way on my watch
I mean I'll admit I probably didn't have
to kill that guy there is another way
but the the drop kill was just easier to
do and less risky man you're such a
chopper
you have slate bolts I'd like to not use
them just yet
wretches cold-blooded a little bit
I'm bloodier when I play this than I am
when I play the thief when I play thief
killing people it just it feels
unprofessional it feels like I was a bad
cat burglar when you have to kill
somebody in theif here though I'm an
assassin it's fine
these guys have just tappers oh they're
big-time tappers
our fair inference and the disappearance
of lady emily heir to the throne has
temporarily estate over here
I'm Samuel and I worked with some good
people who want very much to meet you
they said you'd come out here
I could still hardly believe it I'll
take you to meet them just down the
river from here
all right how did you unconscious bodies
found that sucks wondering which ones
they found who got discovered man who
got discovered wait can you kill Samuel
as far as I know at some point you can
kill everyone in this game hostiles
killed - I'll see y'all take it low
chaos that's good low chaos is good
I do want low chaos the ones you didn't
hide rich well who found them who found
them
this is the Hound pits pub closed for
business after district marked off is
dead from the plague were right under
the Lord Regents nose and he don't know
a thing
of course if anyone finds out what we're
up to the watch will break in with
swords drawn and now that you've escaped
the Lord Regent is going to be tearing
the city apart
take you up to meet Admiral Havelock the
rest of the loyalists the Admirals a man
to be reckoned with if anyone can help
you find that missing girl lady Emily
and clear your name
I expect they're hard at work in there
let's join them they'll help you again
whoever really killed the Empress
even after six months and cold ridge
prison he slipped out like it was
nothing
yes not surprising he was the personal
bodyguard of the Empress you've heard
the stories yes I have it still amazes
me that someone could get to the Empress
and young lady Emily no one knows the
real story Trevor we all have our
suspicions we'll know the truth in time
he's strong and quick but I hope he
understands subtlety as well this isn't
one of your fancy dress parties the
reality is that we need men killed have
you ever killed a man
only with my wind but it's a fair point
as always he'll be here soon and I'm
looking forward to meeting him all right
so so many the chat says why are these
guys so sure you didn't assassinate the
Empress um I don't think they really
give a shit these people are they're
trying to use us they're trying to use
us and that's that's okay that's okay we
can continue this later Lord Pendleton
the man of the hour is here
Corvo I'm Admiral Havelock a true
servant of the Empire like you until the
Lord Regent purged those of us who
wouldn't recognize his claim on the
throne and I'm Lord sever Pendleton
I represent the nobility in our little
group but we all act as equals here at
the Hound pits
this is a momentous occasion cause I'm
going to come out with we've been
building a coalition of loyalists aimed
at ending the Lord region's tyranny and
restoring throne at risk of execution
were committed to finding young lady
Emily and seeing her crowned as Empress
we've got big plans but we can't do any
of it without you
we need your skills your ability in a
fight and in helping us we're going to
help you destroy the men who murdered
the Empress sorry you must be exhausted
we can discuss this further after you've
recovered but before you retire you
should introduce yourself to Piero he's
challenged it's time it's not spoilers I
haven't finished the game I actually
have not finished this game but I double
cross a mile away
he's going to be crafting the gear
you'll need go talk to him and they
smelled that shit coming a mile away
good to have you with us nothing against
the others but there's no substitute for
a man who's done a service for the
growling look at me common beggar
my only question with the double-crosses
maybe is it is it only if you have a
high chaos kind of thing if you kill a
lot of people or does one or the other
double-cross you depending upon whether
or not you're higher low chaos that
those are my only real questions but I'm
pretty sure there will be a double-cross
I'll be crafting your weapons and gear
all custom work for you
kappa now the tank of whale oil will you
get a new tank from upstairs please
while I hold this in place be careful
oils unstable when it explodes there's a
terrible mess and if you read all these
things they appear in your notes I read
them later
I'm just gonna steal all your stuff
along here I know you're my a life and
I'm just gonna steal all of your stuff
all this all this optional or just
sitting all over the place overflowing I
could slowly increase pressure on a
subject over a long period of time and
then observe them for years to see if
the formulation of energetic substances
developed surely the Empress would be
able to if you like Laura what's a good
game subjected doing I believe it or not
now why do
get it near the receptacle magnetism
will do the rest
perfect thank you here see the assassins
mask you're a wanted man so everyone in
the city knows your face is Tarrant you
just hold still fit must be precise
there can you see normally they're
better now I could create more food
upgrades for your gear weapons munitions
but our situation is desperate
scavenge the city for valuables and I
will resell them on the black market
that should give us the money to craft
the things you need Jeff Simon honk and
steampunk
don't need to fight each other they can
coexist
upgrades Oh
what's priority one here crossbow and
accuracy as well with mask optics and
that's what I can afford for now but
we're gonna do fuckload of sleep darts
oh wait I forgot to buy combat her life
who darts now all more difficult soon
you should afford them later and you can
very well you know best let me know if
you need anything more
both capacity for more sleep darts ah
you know what I can choke some guys out
I don't want to be utterly reliant on
the sleep Dart
all right so should I loop this area or
should we just get on with the game you
know do it quick a quick run around and
I want to be able to afford more those
upgrades or anything over here there is
my time
are you rating dumpsters it's so fucking
pathetic so horribly pathetic traffic is
forbidden from landing in the Distillery
District due to risk of infectious
contact violators will be taken to the
flooded district for treatment and
rehabilitation
I do I do want to afford more upgrades
so I think I think looting is an order
later notice later there's something
down there
my you must be Corvo
I am Lydia at your service your room is
upstairs and ready when they told me who
it was well I thought you'd be older
like the Admiral I'm sorry it's so dark
we can't risk being seen it is a bit
romantic though isn't it
do not attempt to house or care for a
friend or family member who shows signs
of course he didn't people are foolish
and believe whatever they're told okay
she's not gonna trust your innocence Oh
will I
log entry wonderful seems we've moved to
a new phase Martin's improvisation
support the former bodyguard has been
freed moved to the staging location
Pendleton's voting bloc and my military
connections all we've lacked is the
ability to reject lethal force in a
controlled manner against a previously
inaccessible to the point we need a man
who can kill the bastards for us
Corvo is more than capable of that when
I prepare this game to Metal Gear not
the earlier metal gears cuz that shit's
linear which is fuck man any items
recovered from doing so are considered
state property
pleased to meet you master Corvo I saw
you at court in happier days but you
might not remember I was once a close
ally to the Lord Regent Hyrum burrows
back when he was just the spymaster
he's one manipulative bastard I can tell
you that there's something distinguished
about you Corvo was their nobility back
in your family line I wouldn't be
surprised
did you know I'm distant kin to the late
Empress in her line not close enough
sadly I'll never be improved see that's
that's our first hint for this guy
that's why I don't trust this guy hun
that is not have the Empress dies his
his plan and share thing to do
he's planning shed me a noble birth
requires a sense of loyalty so I I don't
trust the fuck out of Lord Pendleton no
idea what it's like to suffer Wallis
please breathe two bottles of dunwall
red never mind
which and fetch a clean glass tomorrow
plus he's a skinny white guy called Lord
well this you know what this is a game
with a monarchy and that's that's to be
expected from noble types
tread jump on I can just hold five which
is nice
I think I I think I've looted all the
things you don't know what it means to
work with a man who stood at the
Empress's right hand we can't bring her
back but at least we have the man she
trusted most and maybe we can help you
right some of the wrongs done to you
this bar is mine but please treat it as
your home
Piero still wants a word with you
he's well he's not a diplomat but he's a
brilliant man Samuel is a blessing
without him we couldn't navigate the
waters in here I can't pick it up we
keep our lights low point prying eyes
attention all citizens curfew extends
from sundown to sunrise
unless you're otherwise Onorato
violators will please follow me remember
this this isn't isn't my first time
playing this game I've played through
this section of the game before but I'm
about halfway through the game for my
first time everyone looks sketching in
this game that's the art style which
honestly I think is neat so it's fine
this is your room it was chosen to give
you privacy I understand you'll need
your rest
alright let's continue on with the game
all right
hello cool though your life has taken a
turn has it not the Empress is dead her
precious daughter Emily is lost
somewhere in the city and you will play
a pivotal role in the days to come for
this I have chosen you and drawn you
into the void
I am the outsider and this is my mark
there are forces in the world and beyond
the great forces that we call man this
guy's voice for some reason I hate it in
the second game I believe they recast
this Jessica's newfound power my gift to
you come find me
this how we get magic powers
then this is me at least somewhat
realistic mom sorry steampunk fantasy
world but kind of a neat world
the days that follow were trials would
be great Corvo seek the ancient runes
bearing my mark in the lonely places of
your world and at shrines raised in my
name these runes will grant you powers
beyond those of other men to help you
find these runes I give you this the
heart of a living thing molded by my
hands with this heart you will hear many
secrets and it will guide you toward my
realness
no matter how they may be hidden listen
to the heart now and find another room
it displays the ended of all things
oh by the way this is the the heart of
the dead Empress your your dead lady
loves heart whispers to you and tells
you things
why's it have gears because steampunk
the more serious of all things creative
salons as a confidence to you
I really need that room that makes your
magic recharge faster
when I say that I'm steampunk I don't I
don't know that I am steampunk I've
always liked steampunk how you use what
I have given you falls upon you as it
has to the others before you now I
return you to your world but know that I
will be watching with great interest
we go where we got Bo charms
good lungs find better ones
why somebody bone charms those are the
starter ones those what they give you to
start off with should I clear space for
Samuel then if you like but he won't use
it why he can't sleep in regular beds
anymore or that's what he says says he
was in the Navy too long can you believe
it
oh that pile of wood out there it's a
holy build from an old rowboat where
does Admiral Havelock find these people
I wonder to the heart you can point it
at people
it tells you things about them good day
master carver
Lydia nitrate chores sometimes and I'm
starting to think I never come out ahead
she's a smart one mister below how cute
sound and the Melanesian just says
alright this is why I think Havelock is
going to at least potentially backstab
you at some point this is not a good man
yes yes he has the bloodlust
mad
why is bad someone likes his job I'm
just saying these are hints well let's
get down to it first off I know that
assassination is dark business but
sometimes good men have to do bad things
to make the world right our purpose is
clear we want to restore her Majesty's
line by finding and putting emily
kaldwin on the throne to those ends
we'll hide act in shadow take them apart
piece by piece
well that heart be talking to knives to
the game only when I activated eyes by
your hand it won't be easy he's
protected by his overseers an army of
religious zealots but if anyone can do
it you can your exploits are legendary
Campbell carries a private journal once
you've eliminated him get the journal
because we think it contains Emily's
location recovering hers obviously
critical assuming she's alive that's the
gist of it remember our cause and strike
true we're counting on you
another thing Campbell is holding a
former overseer by the name of Martin
he's one of us and if you manage to find
him give him whatever help you can thank
IKEA master even when he's not working
for our cause it would be good to have
him back here at the house
glad to see you got your rest Corvo
you'll need
it's cousin vital let's get some vital
upgrades we missed
what can I do for you subtitles is the
volume not loud enough for you to hear
the sound I I deliberately wanted it
louder than normal because I know I know
how rich solo streams go alright
breaking my immersion but that's fine
for you for you from a fans anything
from a fans it's it's fine being so dumb
Oh Corvo if you've a moment Corvo hello
I'm Calista I work here for Admiral
Havelock I'm sorry to intrude on your
business but this is important I suspect
you're going to kill the high overseer
that wretched man there's really no
reason for you to listen to me but my
uncle Jeff Kurr now still serves as
captain in the city watch but he's a
good man and my only family the chatter
in servant circles is that Campbell just
took delivery of an exotic poison and I
think I know why my uncle's not
corruptible like the rest of them
Campbell is going to poison my uncle do
you think you could protect him you used
to do that right before you had your
current profession
before you became an assassin
right side missions fun side mission
actually i love that 'extra objective we
got to rescue cornrow it was when i was
when i knew i love this game I'm
supposed to use the heart to track that
here brain and I remember it's that
it'll be super good or pragmatic
pragmatic
goddamn fish waste crossbow dart on that
stupid fish take that you fish
they eat everything we'll find some more
for it'll be fine
ready to go just give the signal I hate
fish when they bite me
my no cam tonight because I'm

[Part II]
I know cam tonight because I'm in a dark
room and you wouldn't be able to see me
anyway it'll be a rough trip it used to
be it go straight up Clarence Boulevard
but now it's not so easy half the city's
dead of the plague the other half
fighting over what's left
city watch still holds the bigger
streets and they set up those wall or
like checkpoints man walks through one
of those and ends up burned to a crisp
everything not controlled by the city
watch is gang territory
the real live birds living on the
fringes like that grin rags he say she's
nuts
which is worse just take your pick
if you decide to go up clapeyron know
what the guard spot you
Hey what is it I think that last one was
moving what yeah the little one not
possibly my inspector than myself or
others moving no more
one two three he coming
so this is like beef very much so yeah
and there's some big differences but one
that I get no
half the block dead from the plague
better them than us at least some of
them had money
disgusting I'm not gonna steal from her
I'm just not gonna do it what does what
does the heart tell me are you a good
person to comment woman she's alright
she's alright or delivered for immediate
deportation to the flooded district
remain in position until qualified
personnel have completed the removal of
infected bodies
I think
granny granny granny come out with me
instead granny granny granny you can't
because your dad dear is that you my
dear husband my eyes aren't what they
used to be
have you seen my little birdies ah the
dear things must be starving without
their granny here birdies here oh my my
my heartless game people should have
random clowns people in cars yeah I've
noticed that nice ones but oh well and
they're not very polite ones either
granny rags granny rags let us in oh
well they'll go away again if they know
what's good for them but what a bother
use the key to the front door love
you'll see to those ruffians won't you
yes I would
let us thank granny I bet you can't even
hear us
have it your way we're here to take your
money granny
wasting our time how much could she have
she digs in trash for a living let's get
it drink I'm trying to know we're
seniors with prank done
should I put them somewhere safe so the
rats can't get them I mean should I
bother I might maybe I'll bother
attention dunwall citizens the following
businesses have been closed and
impounded by the state due to
contamination Pharaohs barbershop and
surgery the do condenser alehouse merits
printing firm pennyworth stack and
saddle Emporium and the smoke street
dice well fuck to kill or not to kill I
can use the combat dart but fuck it
you
attention Watchmen this district is now
considered a highly infected area
residents are to be escorted to adjacent
neighborhoods or delivered for immediate
deportation to the flooded business
shame this game offers many many options
you may have a combat that's better
because the death that's that's kind of
your penalty for failing the stealth
lasted 15 minutes a randomly random guy
m'q random happened to stumble upon the
corpse raising the keyboard and mouse or
her controlling what what would you
think I'm music knowing me knowing me
what would you assume
I think the little birdies are sad today
oh my dear I knew you'd help me with
those ill-mannered boys my brave man
listen granny has a birthday present for
you I got it from the outsider and now
I'm giving it to you go on
it's upstairs on Dom Banerjee I think
you'll cut a nice figure with it
remember how we used to dance our
parties were even grander than those at
the boil Manor everyone wanted to come
the problem is there's so many cool
things to do but they're all lethal see
that's I don't that's the brilliance of
the moral dilemma of Dishonored I might
I might say that you're better
dishonored to worry you can take on
people people easily none not legally in
combat
I can't bear these bottles street
children ruffians every last one of them
rotten apples is the worst you know what
I just thought of you could do something
else for me another little favor and I'd
give you another present another lovely
rune carved from the bones of a dead
whale do you remember any dear she's dr.
Harmon now there was a clever man he's
got all sorts of nasty rat guts and
disease in his laboratory wouldn't it be
a shame if some of that mess found its
way into the bottle street gangs elixir
still that'd teach them see to it dear
I'll find you another present just like
the first
Galvani lives on Clavin Boulevard or at
least he used to use the hurt yeah oh
yeah why not now run off my baby birdies
are hungry so precious hmm
you'll have to go or they throw garbage
I think the little birdies are sad today
careful
granny granny granny come out
be careful Gordo they call her granny
rags you wouldn't recognize her real
name or even the name of her family but
an emperor begged for her hand once and
rich young men fought each other for her
favor
I watched her consider them all measure
their Worth and find them wanting then
she made a different choice you're on
your way to face the high overseer the
leader of a great cult dedicated to
loathing me what will you do I wonder
all right I need to take a short break
we'll be we'll be right back
all right I'm back okay everybody I'm
back I know it was so quiet when I was
away all right all right so here's
another moral dilemma
the game has given me she's gonna give
me another one of these upgrade runes if
I go poison um still er II that makes
play cure with plague and I think I'm
gonna do it just now why not
I want that room I want that
motherfucking room
I mean some innocent people might drink
you know the be tainted batch but most
of the people who die will be gang
members I'm okay with killing gang
members
see gang member I felt nothing
I felt absolutely nothing
out
hey biggest look I'm trapped
there were safety Lansford
you know I'll be there to free in a
minute put this this unconscious guy
somewhere where racks cats can't eat
them you know I'm gonna throw them on
top of these plague infected corpses
that's fine that's a safe place right on
top of plague infected corpses can you
throw bodies in this yes I owe you
brother I want to ask about the mask I
wouldn't want my face seen either
pulling a stunt like that you know what
I'll return the favor come by Grif shot
that's my business
well it was at one time but now I'm
reduced to scavenging things from here
and there as the city dies if you need
anything I wouldn't mind treatment for
lo chaos ghosts will blow over I'm going
for lo chaos though I don't mind a few
bodies Miscavige it's not gonna ruin my
lo que us a few bodies want to look at
some of the things I found good prices I
swear
all right Greg Greg whatever you can go
now we're done with you I get you a good
one
all right so we've got to find infected
rat guts poison a distillery with and
there's a doctor's office over here and
that's that's probably where we're gonna
find rat guts
and I've played too but here's the thing
when I played too we're doing a review
so I didn't I didn't really have the
time to take my time but Dishonored 2
hey you know I got a gonna play a I
gotta get further I got to do this can't
can't sit around and now oh you know
playing 1 I'm enjoying it more than 2
but that's because I got I got a lot
more breathing room here there's no
deadline
it's just I'm completely free to play
this at my leisure and I like designer
to
wait Did you touch the door handle - dr.
gull Bonnie's lab yeah I think so
then you have to scrub the rats get
their vital essences every where the
doctor said vital essences sent me me
guts I think so so your hands need
scrubbing you're unclean unclean that's
nonsense
can't we just no I told you with rubbing
alcohol or white vinegar all right all
right
what is he doing there all day Ambrose
says it breeds rats that carry the
plague
your friends are ignorant the doctor is
a brilliant man if anyone can save this
city it's him the Royal physician is
going to save us
is this ulcer disease destroyers gonna
be so understand how probably what do
you play this Jack it's gonna be around
Royal physician or not I hear tell has
nothing against Jack it's just the same
game dishes philanderer who spends more
time with prostitutes and he does in the
laboratory is this what it's going to be
like when we're married it is isn't it I
hope not
I'm telling you now I don't have the
endurance for it
no facecam tonight because I'm in a dark
room a game like Dishonored really
really needs to be played in a dark room
skipping all that lore
all that long crying out
mission clues when I get
obviously the playground is distinct
from the ordinary rat but in what
respect its size and the coarseness of
its ferb and I believe in intelligence
although the experiments they are not
complete
coriander's zoological Survey describes
only the ordinary rat plague rats okay
the jerk steals from at five or seven
years of most this was not a gradual
migration but they have been introduced
on purpose
sometimes this game can make you feel
really scuzzy really really scuzzy
and yet I don't have to do any of this
this is an optional side quest I am free
to not rob the the plague doctors home
but I'm doing it anyway
got my bad guts oh that's disgusting
not one I guess we're just gonna turn
the faucet on and not really wash our
hands after grabbing the rat guts yes he
just yes what are you doing up here
I don't think she alerted anyone else I
think we got lucky I think we got really
lucky there but this is I'm wearing a
mask
it'll be fine
I think I think we got really lucky with
her not alerting those guards downstairs
I remember what it was but we didn't we
didn't find the clue for the combination
of the safe in here which is nice
fuck fuck that plague doctor fuck em
alright this could be going smoother
what we're doing all right what did I
miss a painting hold on which one this
no I'm unable to grab this one
I'm going to presume we're good with
paintings did I go downstairs hi no
there's guards down there and I I don't
need anything down there
it's not worth alerting them any terms
in there let me see oh go back one more
time we'll check for bone charms
we're we're looking good
no bones germs
I'm not checking for roads I just did
can we get a no kill no detection run on
this game um that could be tedious
potentially
I mean you try for it when you play but
if I fill I'm not gonna you know reload
an old save just to just to do that I'm
going to accept the the occasional
bloodied hands is just that's that's the
price of failure man that bars the price
of failure
slightly awkward position this game
ain't worth it your opinion yeah try it
up try it out you might have to
experience and plus there's there's
nothing forcing you to play this game
non-lethal even like you can just
fucking kill everything if you really
wanted to
boss likes laptop this is one hot bird
can sorts with crazies does rituals and
the like bone charms and such
you sound afraid damn right I am
doubting an ordinary man touched by the
outsider he is giving dark powers he can
sleep here throw it across the room well
bad give him a leg up for sure
it's no coincidence per his name is it
true that he lives in the flooded
district with them weepers and wild
hounds that's what they say perfect
place for a paid killer died thousands a
fucking bad-ass thousand does the jerk
that killed your lover and kidnapped
your kid all right
doubt can suck a fat bag of dicks I know
people like doubt but fuck him I am so
murdering his ass
there's a lot of people in my to kill
list I'm on the fence about whether or
not I'm gonna let him go but I am
sledding downs fucking throat
doesn't doubt canonically survive I
don't give a shit about cannon this is
my playthrough of the game and quite
frankly a detail like that
I really think arcane should have gone
out of their way not to not to make that
a cannon thing they should have avoided
mentioning doubt
don't be south not till the next batch
of elixirs death
so he goes not to the abbey for the
office of high overseer where they train
the overseers to be religious he just
wants to know where his brothers gone
sneaks it you know Eddie Boyet at it
when it's solar brimsley job hidden the
dumbwaiter off into the crowd
ghosts like the ghosts
not quite what I wanted to do but I'll
take it
do it we did it can't stop me now and we
did it when infected the the cure with
plague here's a list of the families
that I'm finding that their watertown
plague here by the way so so we're a
jerk
if I leave the body here doesn't that
make it a little bit obvious that
something shady happened
get out there
look it's not even stash this body I
don't know if there is what I totally
blinked over that you're nuts game
you're nuts
I didn't steal some first I got I got
help elixirs coming out of my ass I
don't need them
this look actually teleporter is just
faster I've gotten past that trap when I
wasn't carrying a body
well I know a hundred of these old rags
my mama used to tell
fuck out
I got it here
appreciate I think it's the water do one
room behind where
I think you're wrong
nothing's peirong
where I went should be in range if
anything I would have missed
granny rags it's got a room need to
forget bad and the one through all
that's distillery nonsense for nothing
get out I knew you wouldn't disappoint
me now I can stroll along the waterfront
and peace and don't think I've forgotten
your little gift go on upstairs dear one
I told him peel it off peel it off so I
can breathe that will never wash never
never never
happy I killed all those people I'm
gonna make the false assumption that the
gang die is from the tainted plague
before they could sell any I'm gonna
make that false assumption that I'm
almost certain the game disproves oh the
room yeah I'm an idiot thank you thank
you
all right powers I mean the first
thing's gotta be blinking to the Hastur
blink is too useful
I just need that bone term that makes
the magic recharge that's what I needs
doing great I couldn't be doing better
oh he was dead anyway Oh Griff can I
afford your other thing go to shop
whatever get all the things right we
want all the things
nope nope nope I am that was an accident
fuck all right I'm not happy about that
fuck
yeah that could have been worse it was
you know what it was
here's the real penalty in a stealth
game that made me feel very an elegant
failing the stealth is its own
punishment in a well-made stealth game
no there's anywhere safe to put him but
we're just gonna we're gonna throw him
there he's going right there
cold is a whalers gaff in 50 years old
at least this guy fuckers forget his old
ass you'd even remember the inference we
tagged it plain under clattering Street
is ours
come on what's the take
like 25
god damn it god damn it in elegant in
elegant very elegant all right come on
what's the take warning + 2 elixir
that's not a safes come that was a
legitimate failure
I just get along he starts to come all
the way off is that true or is it the
itching that really gets you or the rats
Jasper isn't it it's not so bad in here
except I miss your wife huh
you don't scare easy I'll give you that
but that'll change what a sight you are
in that mask I know who you are and what
you're here to do and I can help unlock
me and I'll buy you a drink sure maybe
if you run through it and you're a
little bit so happy I'll buy you a
hundred drinks I don't know or if you
really know where to go but I don't
feels good to stand up straight thank
you Corvo what you're here to do tonight
is of the highest importance we've got
to find Emily so kill Campbell and make
it quick
once it's done search his body for the
journal his notorious black book and get
out of there
Campbell is meeting with the gardening
colonel and word from my informant is
that Campbell is going to poison him
maybe you can use that to your advantage
all right I won't be of any help here so
I'll make my own way back to the Hound
pits pub if I see Samuel the boatman
I'll tell him to pick you up in the
backyard behind the office of the high
overseer may all the spirits guide you
the mayor enemies head hit the floor
without you taking a scratch
I was just reading in the archive about
the heretics right so high overseer
Campbell lethal and non-lethal
assassination used what do we want what
does everybody want occurrence but I did
spy the face of one so branded a former
member of our order of course out on a
retreat we passed through a fishing town
and saw him making his crime who can say
the brand is reserved for an overseer or
even the high overseer himself who
violates non-lethal it's crueler I kind
of agree with that me remember the
sentence strictures and you never need
worry about such matters yes the
possible solutions for this part are
fucking great and amazing
wasn't he the one that girl wanted saved
the guy he's meeting with is but there's
a guy we're here to kill that's a
different guy
I think the non-lethal czar more
engaging I haven't I haven't beaten the
game yet so I can't say for everybody I
know I know the twins one is pretty
underwhelming you hear about it after
the fact
and it's like
oh I'm not I don't want to I am I am NOT
I'm not in stealth mode I'm just walking
I don't think I know enough of the
overseers Laura to be able to call the
assholes is that the regular dart not
the sleep Dart okay that's one more kill
hey coins at xuer coins always pick up
those Sewer coins
all right these overseers I know I know
there's some kind of religious sect I I
really wonder if this didn't start as
some kind of thief game because because
thieves got the hammerites and and
dishonored it's got the the overseers I
know I know I know some of the same
people who made theif worked on this but
saying I wonder man
I only got a couple of tips here uh
Hagrid blaggard says hi space cadets
which bit of pointless modern pop
culture are you most looking forward to
and ready player one I don't know I
don't know what all is in ready or one
I'm gonna say none of them um Boudreaux
says hey rich
Star Wars question mellitus XCOM aww
campaign I've missed almost all my shots
above 85% that's almost certainly not
true that'd be highly statistically
unlikely and several about 95 bad rng
yeah I know statistics can be weird but
if you experienced this look here's the
thing you you notice the ones that you
think you should make more than you
notice it when you actually make them
15% to missed is still a percent right
let you test the tips I got it was word
of Badman about
here's a good boy good boy justice
settle down man it's only me
Boreas gone to the flooded district and
all the rest of them so it's just me
tonight one don't
a little bit lucky don't you call that a
little bit lucky
but first yeah I mean it's not and this
is my second time through this mission
if I've been playing this on my own but
I haven't finished the game yet so read
that as you will
by the way the secret room way too
obvious and easy to find
guess those fools and Coleridge for
letting Corvo get away who knows what
the man could do now Hiram o
Regent as he asked just to call him now
seems to have faith in all the Sokolov
security devices he's put up all over
the city but I'm not so sure at least
the girl has been moved to a safe place
visiting her twice a week is giving me
ample opportunity we saw paintings of
dependability yeah that's the mask a lot
of downs men interesting interesting
and no wine bottle I have to pay
attention is there no wine bottle if
there's no wine bottle in that painting
can I see it after the fact well let me
see it after the fact if if that
painting had no wine bottle because I
took the wine bottle earlier in the game
I love this game so much more that is
there's an amazing attention to teat
that's the case notes books audio drafts
books written notes no no if you steal
the bottle it's not in the painting oh
that's awesome I love this game so much
I love this game so much
oh that got out of there just in time
tonight
did you get caught at the lockdown last
night six hours search the place top to
bottom and nothing to eat with the swill
we hand out free of course we didn't
find anything did I ever tell you one
time one of the second-floor shutters
got stuck open and I thought I could
slip out I couldn't find a way down by
the time I got back I spent the rest of
lockdown out on a Ledge
maybe the outsider was watching
to the beginning it was Martin's plot to
break him out of cold rich prison that's
clear enough but why Corvo the one man
feared throughout the empire
he's as skilled as they say he got
through he would have for watching he
had help yes how far does it go the
trail goes too much too far
fuck it there's the branding iron
we need all right here's the non-lethal
way to take out overseer Campbell is
these religious heretics they have a
brand that they put on heretics to get
them kicked out of the order and so
we're we're gonna force them out of
office by ostracizing them
kill half his guards but not him that's
the kind of guy I am a fuckup
I'm a stealth fuckup
all right here's what's happened the guy
I got a murder is having a meeting with
the guy I optionally
optionally have to save and the guy I
need to assassinate it's going to poison
the guy I have to say see this see this
is a table here and there's two glasses
right I I have a choice on what I do
here were children playing game I can
switch the poison I can combine them
poison them both which is kind of great
honestly or I can destroy both glasses
it's in since I'm trying to do the
non-lethal kill I don't want either of
them to die so I'm going to just spill
both glasses but they give you the
option to poison the first thing that I
loved about this bit is they give you
the option to poison both that does you
no good but they put it in there anyway
because this game is awesome and this
game wants to give you options so we're
gonna spill the drinks
many rooms do I have to do what I need
oh I have four I can afford this the
sleep carts ready watch videos of good
people playing this game it's kind of
amazing what you can do
the servants must have been in here let
me see it seems I have the wrong one not
that one yeah now if you'll join me men
will come get you when we're finished I
don't understand how this got so
unpleasant well I agree or dies and
suddenly this what do you have wine
it's a kivi enriched thank you
it's pissed off that is wine what is
still Dover I owe you an apology
captain this is hardly the hospitality I
planned for you well time to do this
these are gonna kill him anyway so we
have to stop time and do some stuff
Wow Pororo you can you can take some
sleep darts pick them up I know I'm
gonna be making my escape through here
so I'm gonna set down corn row there
where I know it's safe and then I gotta
get Campbell out of here before guards
come in this room
I think rapping nobody's there I just
want to see what they do
so they do realize something's up when
they don't see anyone all right all
right I wasn't sure how they'd react
so uh this is the non-lethal option
this is a full non-lethal right no no
I'll find you I would have been proud if
I got goes but I fucked up too hard for
that
we're just enjoying this a little too
much this game is fucking awesome
first time I played through this right
I not cornrow out
I take Campbell I I do the branding and
then I go to leave and I realized this
is shit tunnel level after you fucking
do your main objective there's a shit
ton of stuff after this right and then I
finished the level and then I found out
cornrows still dead and I'm thinking
wait a minute
I knocked cornrow out but the game
condom is dead because I didn't take his
body with me and it was like they they
thought of that detail like if you don't
take his body with you then the bad
guy's henchmen are probably just going
to kill them anyway I'm like that's a
really neat touch that's a really neat
touch
person in champ I don't know that I'm
liking this more than dishonored to as
much as it is I I have I'm not under any
kind of deadline I have the time to just
take and just enjoy this game and I I
didn't with dishonored to
by playing the whole game I don't know
maybe maybe I'm not playing it all
tonight No
all right so I put cornrows safely in a
dumpster now we can we can go about the
game
should be gathered for whiskey and
cigars tonight never doubt of the way
you expect preferential treatment just
because you are her brother she will all
which is must burn
you appeared as if from nowhere we would
both be dead if not for you we are
forever in your debt
I cannot thank you enough I must get my
sister to safety but first I may know of
a way to thank you there's a safe in the
bunkhouse
the combination is 2:03 take what you
want and good luck rich have you seen
those high-skill chaos playthroughs of
this game I've seen a couple of them and
if you if you mildly enjoy watching me
play this tonight go on YouTube and
fucking look this up there are there are
some people who know this game amazingly
well and they basically just show off
and they do some amazing fucking shit
while they play this game
the same way I played Dead Rising 1 I
just played Dead Rising 1 very very well
these the runs they're talking about are
people playing this game they're just
showing off they're doing unnecessary
shit and they're just showing off and
it's really kind of amazing to just
watch
like this there's more there's more
stuff I can do we finished the main
objective the level is not over I think
I think I'm just gonna get to the boat
quickly but so much shit to do
is that zombie
that's got some fucking eagle-eyed
vision
thank you
so I'm not going for the sake now no no
I think we've we've spent enough time
here I'm debating in my head whether or
not I'm going to play much more of this
tonight or if I'm going to get in a
little bit of into the breach
a Corvo it's Samuel I'm here from the
way I hear it
Campbell lived a pretty posh life maybe
it's not my place to say but men of the
faith shouldn't live like barons are you
ready to go
okay let's go
all right I found the only sokoloff
painting oh yeah I forgot it it's not a
couple of obvious runes that's fine it's
fine
Admiral Havelock and Wilson first live
stream I've actually enjoyed it want to
congratulate why do you much much
I'm glad you're enjoying
people want to join this that's good
he's alive
Thank You Corvo thank you my uncle is a
good man and one day he'll prove it
here I know you did this for the right
reasons but I want you to take this as a
reward
it's an old heirloom one of my aunt's
gave me a hundred bucks on thanks this
is going to work we have to take down
the Lord Regent and all his key allies
you know that yes hopefully the high
overseer is the first step you did it
somehow you took down the high overseer
Campbell against the odds I knew you
were our man called the Campbell gone
we've heard the Lord Regent and
measurements and with Martin back we'll
have the finest strategist alive the
Lord Regent must be shitting himself in
dumb wall tower yes and Campbell's
journalist not forget our hope is that
in these encoded pages the location and
condition of emily kaldwin can be
discovered our entire movement will mean
nothing if we can't place them no you
did this here right reasons said to
poison her for hire oh you're not for
life we must this is no doubt the Lord
this is personal thing Emily somewhere
waiting to reveal her step out as the
hero and further cement his Regency if
he doesn't bring the young lady forth
soon your motivations are either revenge
or wanting to save your daughter but
you're not doing this for money let's go
yes time or even asset you weren't even
an assassin before this you were the
opposite of an assassin or a bodyguard
journal then share the fucking awful one
Oh meeting game-saving your daughter
yeah
all right I'll play all right people
want to see more of this I'll play more
of this but I need to take a break I
need to just get a snack and brain chill
for a bit so I return but we're taking a
break
you
alright alright um I'm back back ish
there's game

[Part III]
there's game Shorter's quake ever I
needed some deep just had some chips
that's what I had
by the every citizens duty to report
treasonous speech and actions the state
depends on you
we're yet rillette Havelock Hamrlik
hello Corvo I expect Martin will be
joining us shortly I hate to start your
day with such a strange matter but the
servants heard something last night
moving through the storm drains beneath
the building most likely a weeper the
poor bastard there's no hope for them
with the plague that's that far along
nothing more than a shuffling corpse
full of sickness and insects if you ask
me I'd appreciate you investigating just
to be sure it's not a nosy Guardsman
that's getting too close
here's a key to the hatches I'd send a
servant down there but they die of fear
on the spot on the frame maybe Pierrot
can concoct some sort of sleep poison
for your crossbow if you want to go that
bit pro all stinks says hey rich this is
my first tip ever I want to save some
questions for when jack is around too
but for future reference if I tip
multiple times in one stream do you guys
answer multiple questions
yeah well answer multiple questions but
we we don't guarantee we'll read every
tip
and you probably don't have to worry
about it just if somebody says something
I don't know just disgusting or awful or
just quite frankly something we don't
want to talk about well we'll ignore it
tip but yeah you can tip ask as many
questions as you're talking one
jeez
that's art
kill them Richardson mercy has a chance
they'll be cured you went down there in
the sewers I thought I heard a weeper in
there earlier
you're probably the bravest man I've
ever met overseer Martin has arrived
he's with Admiral Havelock now they want
to talk to you they're not zombies
they're just zombie like dad there's
zombies whatever it's fine I trust you
remember Martin and overseer before and
perhaps again someday soon I owe you
thanks for my rescue indeed
you've given us a glimmer of hope
because we've gotten what we wanted from
Campbell's journey you've done it we
know where emily kaldwin is being held
the golden cat a bath house for
aristocrats a little better than
Ackerson brothel but there's an
unfortunate twist it appears that
Pendleton's own kinsmen stand in our way
the twins Morgan and Custis not only are
they controlling Emma but they have the
controlling parliamentary votes we so
desperately need yes the Pendleton's
have to die but most importantly Emily
must be brought here safely so we can
protect her until the Lord regent and
his entourage have been dealt with her
Pendleton's waiting for you on the dock
he's asked to brief you personally I
think it's best
oh shoot all the way over there
what's her name Cecilia I forget her
name
I know the golden as the patron mind I
designed some specialized devices for
them right Kevin blueprints if anyone is
curious don't I brought you tea as a
courtesy to a colleague I won't make
that mistake in the future I'm sorry I
only thought never mind what I thought
thank you for the tea I have to get back
to that room so I miss one of the swords
behind me it's fine this isn't my main
playthrough so it's fine master Pierrot
has a great deal to learn in some areas
a royal protector just the man I needed
to speak with
Corvo I'd ask to speak to you myself
you see I'm sending you to kill my older
brothers Morgan and Kostas they're
horrible men it's true as you may have
heard cruel beyond words further my
brothers are close allies to the Lord
Regent and as long as they are in
Parliament we cannot gather the votes
we'll need to stop the Lord Regent from
further consolidating his power these
days they're best known for exploring
their favor with him to cheat others out
of their wealth let's just say that not
every family victory in quarantine for
having the plague actually has the
plague I warned my brothers in every way
I could I really did but they never did
listen to me they'll be at the Golden
Cap tonight at their usual revels
they'll be protected by the city watch
so it'll be dangerous now go please do
it before I change my mind
Pendleton the the bottle has to touch
your lips you just pretended to drink
that and I don't know why
I'll take you to the golden Kratts when
you're ready I've taken Lord Pendleton
enough times believe me
all right so Jeff the Pendleton twins
here lethal or non-lethal what are we
going with personally I think non-lethal
here's a little bit of a wet down
I'll get you as close as I can to the
golden cat Corvo
you'll have to go the rest away on your
own the entrance is near hold the square
the main thing is to make sure that
little girl Emily gets back all safe and
sure them to Pendleton's are there so
I'm guessing they'll be a lot of guards
slackjaw
might have some ideas I'm happy to get
inside the cat if you don't kill you
this here's his territory he and his
bottle Street gang holed up at the old
done walled whiskey factory they sell
the elixir that folks used to fight off
the bank I lay low but keep an eye out
for you and the little lady to bring him
back good luck to you I know Emily must
mean a lot to you be careful going up
the street corpo a river hand I know
pulled up alongside me last night and
said there's one of those watch towers
on clamoring now I guess you getting rid
of Campbell shook up the Lord Regent
okay so I gotta I gotta make like Chuck
green save my daughter
it's our bat that's a little a little
teaching moment there
huh
Emily's your daughter spoilers
it's so fucking heavily implied it's so
heavily implied
please please man
at some point it's not a spoiler it's
just common sense
we keep saying huh
died
well okay it saw me that
skur myself
Hey I fucked up when I got caught by the
tower at that point the ghost dream was
over man
the dream of ghosting was over hey
you're just a man nice lookin for slack
jaws wanting to talk to you dad him yeah
he's the one hey we got a message for
you from slackjaw he wants to talk at
the distillery
first things first here
Hey
was this
hello just saw that out of the corner of
my fucking eye no one
was it was it worth it
I don't know I'm sure most yeah no it
wasn't worth it at all
I'm missing Luke Skywalker what the fuck
are you talking about
chat
should should I be kind
got anything to smoke or eat shut up hey
boys just gonna teleport right next to
you
I don't think they're gonna last much
longer in there that's what they get for
taking free sweets from the steel that
tainted elixir is bad stuff I guess
starting to get a little blood thirsty I
never said I was going for pacifist than
you think
wait I never made that claim easy you
just need a bit ain't you heard
slack job keeps the good stuff for
himself rest of us
all right attacked me slack Joe
don't waste time than if I judge your
looks alright I might have some work for
somebody put plague in the proof tank
half my men are weepers
drop three of them in a distillery rest
don't wander an industry since it's so
and I find myself short of able bodies I
may have a point of interest for you see
way I figure it there ain't nobody worth
killing around here except those two
Pendleton's over at the golden cat I'm
right and I see it's not your nose then
voice of twins rich mean and weird worse
than most of their ink
they've been laying low there awhile not
sure why there's a lot of security at
the Golden Cap tonight though special
guests in the mic but you're gonna walk
in there dressed like that and kill the
Pendleton brothers maybe I got a better
way to take care of them too if you're
doing something for me first understand
someone I don't know who is killing my
men taking my territory stealing my
goods might be a fellow named of Galvani
I said my best man to investigate but he
went missing and well now I need someone
to find what happened to him
go to this Galvani's place he lives
nearby of clattering Boulevard you do
that for me and I'll get you a better
way into the golden cat
well we want to find a better way into
the brothel so we're gonna do what he
says rich did nothing wrong no I didn't
I killed one of the assassins who helped
killed my my just wasn't really my wife
it's kind of an illicit thing really by
the way you see these these plague
zombies I don't believe they're there if
I don't poison the still so those people
are zombies because of me
and my actions now she wasn't she wasn't
your wife because we're not royalty
we're not rat Noble we we couldn't marry
her well your your relationship with the
Empress is just scandalous it's purely
scandalous but it was love
I love this game disliked how it
punished you for playing lethally how
how does it punish you for playing
lethally you affect the world around you
and it's a beautiful thing man hey
blow-off chocolate and you can kill
quite a few people and still get the lo
que hace you can still get the best
ending and kill a surprising amount of
people I yeah I know because I've been
getting the low chaos mission rankings
and I got like eight or so murders a
level and it still says I'm low chaos
I am annoyed that in the very next
mission we play if I if I if I could put
on my critic at the side objective has
is going to the very same place that the
side objective and the last mission had
us going to so this is the second time
in a row we are going to this doctor's
office
yeah it is a bit lazy
did you see him you sound like a lot of
blood really wish I saw not a big deal
maybe you can go up later and take a
look after the mother to are gone
it's a solid game looking back yeah I
could see why they never made enough to
they made a number two of us we mean
shit
what do you think I think he's dead do
we have suspects
suspects we ain't gonna waste time
solving he'll personally if I give it a
drink what are you gonna put on your
report
I'm gonna say we found one a slack-jawed
men inside all dead and bloody and that
you are speaking
get up right now where are you someone
get over I'm getting reckless yeah I'm
getting a little bit loose a little bit
less careful I've been playing for a
while now I think I'm wearing down it's
fine
I'm still having fun what happens if I
bring the body back where should I bring
the body back with
no ghosts or clean hands I don't give a
shit about achievements I care about
having fun chief ones can go fuck
themselves I can't bring the body okay
that answers that
some achievements are fun I guess but if
it's fun to do do you really need the
achievement to do it
like clean hands like it felt okay if I
wanted to play through without killing
literally killing nobody hey that's my
third time through the game not my first
no I don't hate fun but I don't think
achievements are inherently fun
achievements just like a checklist do
this do that
hey hey hey wait a minute what just
occurred to me how come it's always me
who pay for the whiskeys
well having your weapons out slows you
down I didn't even know that I didn't
even know that I just learned something
new
check check if you enjoy Cheeseman's go
ahead and do them I'm not trying to
strip them out of existence I'm not I'm
not going to gather together the
infinity gems so I can will away the the
very existence of any and all
achievements but there's something I
personally don't give a fuck about
what's this information from my missing
guy let's have a listen
like Tom it's me crowd was right there
is someone what you do
what's a tick over the Diller over if I
made it in it's it's my game to make so
crows did my achievements would be the
most fucking obnoxious Bissell finger
you know you and me had a deal and so
that Joe never goes back ever
I have been literally been around in a
circle this 100,000 times in a row hotel
abandoned since the plague gutted this
part of town take the stairs to the top
you can use the roof to get into the
golden cat brother see that select Joe
keeps a bargain just as good as the men
who run the city talk to everybody in
the game everybody in the game in
alphabetical order each other out again
I could get rid of the Pendleton's for
you quiet like and without killing him
but you got a deuce and I would not have
a convenient list with everybody's name
my achievements would be the worse and
by virtue of being the worst also the
best
the cats having a big reopening tonight
a lot of money clients including an arts
dealer name of bunting
he's got particular taste so so I've
been told by some of the ladies got some
pretty fancy stuff locked away at his
place and the only thing preventing me
from Natick all that loot is the
combination to a safe
of course the Pendleton's have been
camped out there for months - not sure
why so that means a lot of the city
watch and other soldier types bring me
that combination my masked friend and
then I take care of the Pendleton
Brothers just like that
you ain't never even gonna touch up and
I promise I won't kill him and no one
will ever see them again now if that
ain't a deal slasher don't know what is
why do you trust this guy more than
people were working for this guy's
upfront about HIPAA dick
yes that combination he wants for the
same to keep my eyes you can rob the
safe before you give him the combination
and it doesn't hurt you at all you could
just screw him over at the same time you
know what he was straight with me I
didn't rob the safe good
hey don't you owe me a drink like
someone else
how do we get around this you just down
there now
a filthy mudlark better tramp like you
get elixir
we've been out half rations for a week
ain't catching no the cops are about to
rob this way you get lost this here's a
private party help sir please help me
thank you thank you sir
you saved me how can I thank you
I have nothing wait take this it's the
back door service key to buntings house
the art dealer on the main street I used
to work for him you know
before the plague he's let all his
servants go but he's still there
probably hoping he'll be able to sell
something from that safe of his I don't
know what he has left but it's all I
have to offer you
please take
again your your your elixir lady I can't
thank you enough strange but the stuff
that they were trying to steal all right
we're loyal Brescia is now in effect
non-compliant
Venice
perfect
they go get your own squad after what
happened last night yes of course
all right listen fault I got to stop
with those damn miss clicks that's gonna
kill me almost did once it's fine all
right another criticism when you get
that arrow that means you're gonna be up
on the ledge you don't always go up on
the ledge and then come on man come on
fuckin rats lousy fucking rats alright
we're going to the whorehouse just
Bridget Eddie said anything for a new
best of the worst
oh that's been canceled
how do we do first her get lost trying
to make supposition what powers can we
afford can we afford you just barely I'm
not that kill happy I'll be fine with
wind
tracking
Morgan's in the steam room down the
stairs tonight it's just safe in there
because I've heard rumors one of them
gets hurt I'll lose my job
oh that's just the girls talking it's
nothing
pressure builds up in the pipes and well
it almost never happens I'll make sure
they never mention it again anyhow
Morgan insisted to be in the steam room
tonight I list this my first time
through Custis is easier to manage some
nights he just waits in the gold room
and talks to a girl it's funny what
people will what alerted them
oh you saw me
they saw me that sucks
my plate there wasn't that bloody it
wasn't like I missed that because
everyone was dead I just I missed that
bit of conversation
in case you don't know where the
dormitory is I already know where is it
simply through it this part
I wonder if I've been careless enough
right now I've got like medium to high
chaos it's something else is different
to less the other time I played this
mission there was a woman here I wonder
I wonder if the ruckus scared her off or
if I didn't run her trigger something
else that causes her to come up
who are you why are you wearing that
mask
no it wasn't the one I choked down she's
the one that I encountered in the office
before there's just a mother normal old
prostitute that long time ago you're not
dead
no what you mean I have a plan I almost
got away twice there's a special door to
come and go for special people and I'll
show you and if anyone tries to stop us
you can fight them it's this way no she
walks into that room that's downstairs
somebody else was in this room because
at the time somebody else is in this
room the one that I choked out was
already choked out and my other
playthrough
don't think where'd you go
jeez Emily
you can wait him way ahead of yourself
Italy
the door is locked unlock it so we can
get away from this place leave no neck
on show and that's not fun let's go
let's get out of here
Emily I've got to go take care of some
dudes this is the door I cut out once
then they caught me and mocked it oh do
I need the key yet nope I got the key
we're a minority right after this I'm
smack dab in the middle of that's where
I'm at my normal playthrough
rich what is this fun you speak of
oh I'm sorry let me go put on Final
Fantasy and hit the a button repeatedly
talk to that nice girl again when I told
you about
you realize you're at the golden camp
right yeah but she's different she
really liked idiot
she likes your money not you you're just
jealous
shut up
I don't have to like FF but admit I'm
wrong wrong about what the tedious
combat the shit characters fuck Final
Fantasy
the Pendleton's are here you're supposed
to be on duty there's supposed to be on
guard
you'll get dismissed for sure I can't
believe this you said you weren't even
drunk wake up finally I've been like
this for 20 minutes your footsteps sound
a little loud and you gained a little
weight on it I just like last time
understand slowly and only trigger the
shock at my command get it and the safe
word tonight will be retribution let's
say you hear that you stopped one sharp
out of line and you are out of a job
stay focused please
oh I deserved that one
shall I tell you why the pendulums are
heater right stop with them I cheated
them rob them of thousands
you're ruthless
don't hold back I'll tell you everything
the Pendleton's inheritance was worth
hundreds of thousands at least told me
it was junk retribution retribution that
was perfect for tonight all my service I
said the tribution now let me out
bitch who is this what do you want the
safe yes of course the combinations 879
take anything you find I think I felt my
heart skip
please my heart will take this ask me
anything
I screwed the Pendleton's yes and and
I've been to the brimsley see they
worship the outside I've seen it I did
it too
Wow one too many times
alright it's fine how are you still
moving
shet who who the fuck's told you this is
gonna be a no-kill playthrough who said
that I demand to know do we know where
the Pendleton's are gold room steam room
all right or the clues that we have
Morgan will be in there all night more
coin for us that we'd make even more if
they didn't blow it on prostitutes my
cousin's a foreman at their mind
he says the slaves have dug half a mile
down so deep they're dying by the Dozen
from collapse or fumes but the silver is
almost gone what are they going to do
looks like they're gonna gamble and
drink every night until it's gone and
jump in the river right they state that
the conservative position gets an extra
three votes
things are bad could the city get any
worse chances are very good
done
gone
pressure valve a stopped working poppet
properly this is the second time you
will not get a third chance do you
understand repair it promptly reroute
valve you say hmm is steam valve hmm
that's our target
anything kills more fun with these guys
I'm gonna be honest with you
can i rewire it
Oh lock the door
something I can do I don't know that I
can
actually already lock can I block it
as far as I know I can't so I'm just
gonna I'm gonna proceed with the plan
took the prostitute out with him that's
that's cold man that's cold sorry lady
I'm gonna take your money though
ya know an innocent woman like I'm not
proud of that one but it's neat to see
what happens
there's been word of a ruffian
I hear you didn't say
who do you want me to be tonight the
Pendleton anyone high overseer hey
excited me to retreat
well we made it away I don't feel very
good about this this is turning into a
glorious train wreck yeah it's fine
these guards they're really dumb and
it's fine
oh damn it damn it damn it
so long for so you having to come that's
kind of fun man
so much for dumb guards ain't you can't
win them all
which way to the egress
I hesitated I thought wait they're
walking away I don't need to kill them
but then I forgot I am holding a cook
grenade in my hands that might be the
dumbest thing I have ever done but there
was some thought behind it it was just
dumb thought
we network
yes I have been disarmed my stealth has
been Dishonored
I've dishonored the very concept of
stealth tonight by the way with that
grenade if I had the cam on you still
wouldn't be able to see me because it's
too dark in here
there would have been a very nice
facepalm but don't dally that young
let's head to our daughter just get the
fuck out of here
like I'm going the wrong way
say no emily's have the boat but I went
the wrong way to get to the vote because
this is a this mission is a comedy of
errors only it's missing the comedy so
it's it's just errors
look out for the watch they got no
respect for laws
this matter I'm having fun
she get more review views and Isola
strays are bad I really need jack i met
your friend Samuel he's going to show me
how to steer this boat Samuel and I were
worried about you Corvo ready when you
are
are you both ready to go Corvo you must
have worked wonders out there in the
city tonight I can't believe my old eyes
alright there we go we got you know what
all that matters
we got Emily back safe okay and by the
way people are talking about you getting
punished for killing a lot of people
it's fucked up as that was look at it
says for my overall chaos ax
alright it's still low so there is still
room for playing this game in murdering
people and still getting the quote best
ending found dick all for money that run
though
so you did the business did you core
vote I'm not one to speak against my
betters minded but if anybody ever
deserved their fate
it was those Pendleton's what business
are you talking about oh I got grown-up
business girl I mean your ladyship
forgive me it's okay I heard a lot of
grown-up business at the golden tab oh I
should concentrate on piloting misspoke
Karen yes but I know I'm playing this
I think this honor does a solo game
young lady Emily I'm Calista I'll be
caring for you and schooling you while
you're with us pleased to meet you as am
I would you like to see your room in the
tower can I see it yes you may you will
get to see it all the entirety of The
Hound pits good I think I'll like it

you later
you do not fail to impress armed with a
blade you've changed the course of the
city forever
and with the Pendleton twins gone our
own Lord Pendleton will assume their
votes in Parliament in one night you've
done more than most men do in a lifetime
I need to speak to you soon but for now
Lord Pendleton requests your attention
she doesn't even call him dad I don't
think she knows this is an illicit
affair between a common bodyguard a
commoner and the the high Empress of the
land
wait she's his daughter well here so far
it's only been hinted I don't know if
they explicitly state that later in the
game I'm pretty sure it said flat out
and dishonored - alright I think I think
that's good for the night nothing that's
good a really shitty stealth run but god
I I love it i I absolutely fucking adore
it
absolutely adore it alright um I caught

Playstation 4 is blood-borne which is
fantastic but otherwise I'm pretty much
