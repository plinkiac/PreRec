do I sound decently now I've changed
what mic I'm using someone recommend
Leonard Cohen albums I'm not an album
guy I don't think in terms of albums I
can name me a few Leonard Cohen songs
that are fucking awesome Leonard Cohen
did the future which was featured in
Natural Born Killers the future is great
he did everybody knows which I fuckin
love and Karen's really fond of oh yeah
I think of that leo yeah yeah I think
all right so um here's what's going on
today part of the reason I played a song
first supposed to give you know people
time to file in before I before I really
get into it Jack wanted to possibly talk
about the new deus ex game that came out
and I figured if we're gonna talk about
the the new game that comes out and I
don't even have one percent sure we're
gonna do that still but figured if we're
gonna do that I should be familiar with
the last one with the human revolution
the prequel it's not really a I guess
it's technically a prequel because it's
a prequel to the original Deus Ex and I
guess it would also be a prequel to the
one that just came out all right it's a
prequel yes Karen knows about planet
coaster so I have not played this game
before I actually played a little bit
less than I played a couple hours before
I had a thought you know if I'm just
gonna try and and play my way through
this game I may as well stream it I mean
why the heck not let me let me get my
number pad set up here which I should
have plugged in earlier but I didn't
think - it's fine everything's fine
all right and fair warning because I
kind of want to play this game for
myself is gonna be pretty quiet rich
stream maybe even quiet relative to
other rich Evan streams but I thought me
playing through it I don't know how much
I'm gonna get through I don't know how
long the game is but I thought me
playing through human Revolution for the
first time people would want to see that
so uh here we are here we are kill or
knockout I'm not entirely sure I played
through the first section and it doesn't
seem like you have a choice I couldn't
oh god sorry I got got some got some gas
here oh I want to built right into the
mic that would be horrible but I tried
to go kill us in the first section and
it didn't seem to want to let me now I
did not play the original original so
I'm just gonna do a new game here medium
difficulty I'm probably I'm probably
never going to play a vampire the
masquerade I'm sorry
let me know if the TV is picking up in
my mic Jack knows I'm streaming I don't
know if he's gonna be free later he
might he may stop by he's under no
obligation to
you're not hearing the game at all all
right after the cutscene I will look
into that
I read the fucking chat
Lord Lord Saavik I read the damn chat
it's quite a stream because I don't talk
much during rich heaven solo streams
Karen's settling in great
yes we still plan to stream tomorrow
night this is not not a replacement
this is a last-minute rich thing
yes this is my no skipping cutscenes OCD
alright try turning it up in here turn
it way the fuck up
and you let me know if it's deafening
can you hear it now is there game audio
I think that's fairly important
all right why why is that not working is
it a number one thing oh it's the number
lock thing thank God I thought I was
gonna have to rebind everything all
right
apparently oh wait I just switched that
bind all right I played it long enough
to try and find key vines that will work
for me am i weird
what did you mean back there Meg about
how you found it
nothing it's just there's something I
should know about this place about Sarah
Megan we're still getting biochemical
fluctuations across the artificial flow
cell okay but the increased neural
peptides coming from the P dot cluster
could be throwing off your calibrations
right I double-check that
I can't believe you were asking about
David you've been here long enough to
know what Eric he wouldn't be her town
has zero pokey stops I thought there are
all over the fucking place the one one
time I played Pokemon go on the stream
with Jack it seemed like there was crap
all over it seemed like he couldn't walk
two feet without running into crap you
overthink everything Adam the work we're
doing is good we're helping people
overcome their fear main character Adam
Jensen he's kind of quiet he's kind of
generic hard-ass
ah dr. Reid this is general O'Neill dr.
Savchenko was telling me you've made
progress on the typhoon yes thanks to
Vasily actually as I was saying sir
the typhoon uses a modified combat
chassis like the one I'm wearing but
I've improved its design using shaped
micro charges to propel the steel balls
and the back glass problem solved
through kinetic bleeders in the oven
here Watch go ahead
I'm afraid I have to run but Vassili has
all the details general you're right
you're missing the point
Space Ghost is annexed but neural
augmentations that mean we got faster
react in the future you can really when
they get feeble augmentation its yeah
David talked about it for years
yeah here's a talker I'm space cyber
camp
admitted a part of you likes him no I
like everyone don't you read yeah right
I'm an ex-cop from space now I'm a
corporate cop up are you going look at
my robot eyes I forgot to leave her keys
so she will not yet they will be rolling
eyes I need to get punched in the face
first destroy that bears yet but I get
robot eyes
me too about a lot of things
there's something I
well good evening you're gonna say
something right
why'd you stop so I know just walk to
the elevator but so what
you can tell me you what hats on what
you don't know great now it's a sausage
fest and here's that firewall yet you
don't fix an entire firewall you find a
loophole and then did you plug it yes I
did oh wait I'm not gonna do the space
cowboys the whole damn story on you
mostly because I haven't played this
game you a trapeze and I want to
actually you know like experience the
game I played through this section
before she wants me to show her this
maze can haven't located her prices says
that's in character
this is the newest and encrypted GPL
trackers
sure what it takes I want you Darrow in
Washington why my side that doesn't jump
for anyone
senators love this guy Lyle the hearings
will go much
big day for us tomorrow everything in
place you sir
Capitol Police boss quarters to the hill
and then federal protection services
takes over good good
how's that girl holdin up she's nervous
oh she has to do is show more research
she explained it to you now really into
the whole science thing boss it's
incredible
all those purists out there accusing us
of tampering with the natural order when
all Megan's done is figure out how to
unlock the potential that exists within
our own DNA you know for five one irony
were there any come on Darrow ever did
environmental malfunction laboratories
subsection 6 all lab Chiefs please
report in we better not take any chances
not tonight these may all have better to
get down there I'm assuming this came
out last gen I don't even remember when
this came out it's kind of amazed at how
relatively bad another that looks
terrible but how relatively bad this
looks
I think this games a little bit older
than I thought maybe just a little bit
all right I'm gonna try cranking up
people said the game audio was a little
bit quiet I've got cranked up now I
cranked up all the way see you let me
know you let me know if this is too bad
too loud
Prichard where's Megan super Borden yet
her GPL implant shows her moving through
the microderm labs I think she's running
damn
what's the matter serious equipment
failure can you get eyes on her
Richard Richard
oh no it's fire
I don't know how to do this for section
no-kill there's no takedown option
do you just want to sneak past them
you even get anything in this game for
non-lethal or just personal satisfaction
all right just run past look this were
an actual situation just running past
those guys would be kind of dumb I think
I think this is a situation where lethal
force is perfectly acceptable
a little bit disappointed himself
honestly
we beat them up this our fists even an
option
nothing has told me that I can fist them
assuming I can't kill her but you know
fuck
well Ted
did I accidentally win
don't you say one I'm fine with that but
I don't mind stealthy snow that's fine
I think the gas the gas killed brother
and I didn't even mean to hit that gas
canister I think I just shot it lying
when I was blind just an accident but
you know what I'm fine with that
I might intend to play this is a mix of
stone and guns
your cc1 correct
this is intro she's the best I don't
know I feel like the Mass Effect 2 kind
of Lazarus cutscene Shepard Magdalene
I think that meets this
and that you've lost enough people today
you work at me to play this is the one
this has been on my I should really play
it simulator list better remove and then
Jack's been talking about maybe doing
something about the new Deus Ex which
it's not a guarantee that we're gonna do
anything with that but I figure if we're
gonna do that I should play through the
original and if you want to stream
against me today you know it'll probably
fine cuz I've never played this I'm
gonna be paying a lot of attention to
the game and a little bit so I know
what's going on
so I played through that part a little
bit of the first discussion forum last
night before I decided no I'm as no
stream
but I'm gonna be pretty quiet
now the second mass effect is good it
doesn't have a strong a main story
running through it lots of great
characters and some fantastic world
building in Mass Effect 2 and the the
last mission it's David of Mass Effect 2
is one of the best climaxes of anything
ever
the suicide mission is the session is
the absolution tree meet me at the
helipad I have to see Pritchard first
something's wrong with my retinal
enhancement Frank's on the second floor
in the tech lab make it quick
people's lives are at stake why is David
keeping the SWAT team
about time what happened you get stuck
in an air duct on the way over
yeah nice to see you too Francis
something's wrong with my retinal
display can you fix it if it's what I
think it is probably of course it might
right imaging processors weren't
completely in sync don't worry your
centrosome aspect is a nice any damn RPG
action game hybrid a retinal display
should be fine now it's recognition
that's born as an RPG tries to shine
this game absolutely fucking face-plants
at the action part we done here though
the characters you saw are so good you
don't know don't give a fuck I know
everything else like game was have
broken into our manufacturing plant and
taken hast a spec to actually has maybe
this time you'll actually acceptable
decently acceptable combats actually
pretty good decent not the best ever
fucking if you get a problem confront
your man once you just say it and get it
over location is great if anything I
blame myself
the mighty Pritchard blaming himself
that's gotta be a first I'm the one who
told sour if we needed a physical
security team to protect us if he'd read
my report closely enough wait a second
are you saying it was your idea to hire
me not you Jensen I wanted dynacord
sharp-edged or bell tower all the top
private security contractors were on my
list but Seraph wanted somebody in-house
and so did dr. Reed I suggested leave
Megan out of this why Jensen it's no
secret how close the two of you were and
let's face it you've just been fired
from SWAT for that Massacre in Mexican
town no one was about to hire you you
really have to stop getting your news
from those PICUs blogs Francis they only
confuse you the point is if Sarah had
listened to me we wouldn't be having
this conversation
but Megan God love her always did have
serifs ear serifs ear is gonna be
hearing a report about violence in the
workplace if you keep their self
you really feel like continuing point
taken all right
don't shoot some things
Adam how close see to the helipad almost
there good because swats about to turn
this into a PR nightmare meet me in the
chopper
I'll brief you as we go
go to my office why do I need to go to
my office now look how I'm gonna get
through the game I can't stop look at
everything didn't think we'd see you
around here for a while yet you know how
it goes Malik duty calls
don't I know it else I was in my
wingsuit halfway to the top of the
Renaissance Center when I got the 9-1-1
but you six months is a hell of a short
time to come back from the dead
maybe you sure you're ready for this
maybe I'll come back Roger then this
game sometimes it's already more arguing
with the DP DS technically just space
cop bull I've got the plant surrounded
but mr. serif wants you to go in first
you all set here because the sooner we
take off the better it will be for
everyone
I'm ready great then let's get airborne
whole point of this room that's like it
experienced this game if I'm doing space
cop talking over everything that's just
I'm not going to be able to experience
this is just bass cop though I am Space
Camp
I'm robots means can that's so
embarrassing
I told Farina to put his dad on a roof I
don't want the crowd seen you go in fine
as long as she pulls you out the minute
I'm gone so what am I looking at here
who are these guys crawl human purists
or so they say the same purists who've
been firebombing limb clinics all over
the country you buy that no I don't
think it's a coincidence they hit us
today only hours after he moved to
typhoon in for assembly line factory the
typhoon Megan's team was testing it the
day that bastard who's on point for
these guys Adam
no you and Megan will once who is on
point for these guys
goes by the name of Sanders that's him
there
he's an Augmented Adam so he can't be
one of their mercs who attacked us but
he did know exactly how to get inside
our plant all right so how do you want
me to handle this when I guess I keep it
out until you've secured it as far as
rules of engagement go I'll defer to you
lethal or non-lethal
I'm not looking to start a firefight in
there just neutralize them okay but just
make sure those bastards don't wake up
and warn their friends you remember what
it's like in there a lot of tight and
closed hallways but the labs themselves
are pretty open high ceilings so do you
want something you can use from a
distance or up close give me something
with distance if I get too close I'll
take them up personally just try not to
break anything expensive the typhoon
should be in the factoring labs but
Prichard will tell you more as you go in
I've got them running comms terrific
anything else
keep your eyes open for hostages freedom
if you can but the typhoon is your
number one priority we've developed it
for the alphabet agencies and if we know
some of them intact it's still a secret
well a little bit I'm sure you'll get
the job done right totally see him doing
the voice possibly would have been a
better choice
somebody wants to mod his face cop body
wonder this game I will gladly dub in
the voice
I got a very important text I got a very
very important text that I have to
respond to immediately
Caryn's on the job hunt and and and I
think she caught I think she caught a
big one so III need to text back because
this is this is actually very important
I'm so sorry I'm doing this in the
middle of the stream but this is good
news yeah I got my priorities straight
goddamn it little lady gets the new job
but I gotta I gotta back her up
I gotta I gotta throw in my support
okay okay where were we at I asked we
were going to do not know things we're
gonna stop the fuck out of this shit in
Siena few of them coming out for a smoke
every now and again so be careful
tell me you're the guy we've been
twiddling our thumbs waiting for SI
security name is Jensen Jensen yeah I
thought I recognized you used to be on
teams talents Amstel that's fine to me
cuz I'm not I'm a staff guy well I don't
good self you're taking orders from a
CEO things change not always for the
better feel like getting in there and
doing whatever it is your boss wants you
to do cuz maybe then we can do our job
you look pretty dug in up here
what's the react team plan we got off
this point and Bravo was wing boat
standing by to breach your target we're
coordinating I'm here but until your
boss gives us the go-ahead we're just
holding our dicks realistic honey
features how much time do I have before
any shooting starts according to
protocol none according to your lawyers
yes my first time this way it's gonna be
a very low talk straight down and call
it basically before I decided to stream
this hell on these pure it kind of got
as far as talking to this guy and and
knocking the first person out how many
am I looking at down there
hard to say we've spotted three in the
courtyard maybe half a dozen inside but
that's a sketchy estimate at best since
we seem to be getting a loop playback
off you're in telecoms that shouldn't be
possible
I told Seraph to make sure Pritchard
overhauled the system well someone
inside must be tech savvy because all
we're seeing is a loop for all we know
there could be five 10 or three dozen
purpose in there they communicate any
demands yet not yet but I get the
feeling they're not that organized most
of the guys I've seen look like Street
bangers and thugs the kind of get their
jollies thrashing equipment you asked me
is the man in charge you have to worry
about
the leaders name is Sanders right what's
his story
Zig Sanders we're running background on
him now
looks like he fought two tours in the
Gulf one of them on a recycle and
military bill you mean he's augmented
Seraph told me is not it used to be
augmented says his odds made him do evil
shit so he ripped him out nice got a
whole crew of gullible street kids
listening to his crap and ready to die
for him or kill I think I've heard
enough you sure wouldn't want to make
your boss unhappy
we've got people inside any idea where I
should look for them yeah your plant
manager Josie Thorpe managed to slip a
call out before someone snatched her
cell she said the hostages are being
held in an office near the assembly labs
makes sense
the workers were setting up for a
production run so they'd have been
concentrated there you know more about
that than I would anything else I got it
from here sit tight wait for Seraph
signal like we got a choice so I am here
that's good
they mark things on this map like where
is the the assembly line offices were
where are those because I need to find
hostages how long fuck it fuck it
what could I steal I stole that whatever
that is it's mine now bitch
Jensen it's me Pritchard where are you
on a roof overlooking the plant good
your point of entry should be through
shipping and receiving should be Francis
the hell does that mean we have an
employee entrance they're heavily
guarded by purists no doubt so if you're
not a fan of the frontal assault I
suppose you could try accessing the
building's roof
yeah everything seems under control no
sign of squat no sign of anyone I did
the lethal one shit oh well so much for
non-lethal so much for non-lethal I got
them ass-backwards it's fine it's fine
could I not
is he just not oh wait
now I'll take all your shit
while my stealth has not been busted but
by my non-lethal plan here I went to
shit real quick didn't it
what's in here what's in here
you got something from your room magic
room
it's fine now whatever it was it stunk
oh oh okay still good for my for my
totally viable no kill run totally
viable I'm gonna get it so far how this
is largely just an experiment right here
how aware are these guards
alright that did not work out
not gonna be a person alright why do I
not you know why don't I got a cursor
for everything put the stupid gun is
that because it's a non-lethal gun I'm
figuring out this game by the way I
don't know what the fuck I'm doing
alright alright that was that was a lot
of experimentation
oh good I get to redo him too good
oh hey look at that though I am gonna
get I am gonna get these
okay well not my my non-lethal run is
totally viable sir climbing I think
doesn't walk were jumping shit I can't
like mantle up there
that's stupid oh then the Sabre man but
my arms still want to work man
just arms so hard you know
I move the damn box
Oh
I wonder what box related shenanigans I
can't pick you up
nope
can't unplug that
thing I can shoot why can't I pick you
up
can I climb with a box
I probably can't climb on the box but
it's worth a shot
nope can't climb with a box alright
I've not played Deus Ex before this is
all brand new to me
I can't mantle is there a fucking switch
like 90% chance this kills me right yep
all right all right
no sign of animal
somehow I got a feeling my plans of a
quick playthrough of this game not gonna
work out so well and why do you get them
all right something behind you I'll for
fuck's sake what the fuck this is the
dumbest thing I have ever seen this is
the absolute dumbest thing I've ever
seen
a searcher ooh whoa look at all this
goodies here remote detonated explosives
um guys this gonna be one of those games
where stealth means run through all the
vents Bridger I'm in nicely done Jensen
may I ask how a vent on the roof it'll
be in my report next time we discuss
security loopholes oh goody I'll be sure
to take notes the typhoon is in the
factoring labs
there's an elevator just passed the
assembly labs that will take you to it
got it
it's
Hey anyone there no just us pigeons
something running jump is not really an
option though what I wouldn't do for
some Batman vision right now must have
imagined
all right that guy it's gonna be a
problem
that's like a sneak around
can I just try it
oh you prick
Oh
easy
taking wast innocence anybody seen deer
at probably smoking a cigarette Wow
you shouldn't be wandering off like that
bad almost went badly mini-map yeah good
advice good advice I wasn't even
thinking about that mini-map this guy's
moving now I better get out of here
Jennsen
I just tried to unlock the assembly lab
door but my override codes aren't
working someone's changed the protocols
what didn't you plug them I'm on it but
until I find this particular breach and
fix it you'll have to hock the door
manually Richard out that one well I
would have opened our lockers they're
fucking people coming
how does this game work what all right I
don't know what I'm doing
yes yay
sure what up access granted
I I did it I think you did it yay
yeah calling me a pig no way
tell you the Shred what's that bomb
built off this guy will be the last skin
in here goodbyes
shut up chamber Trevor you got to calm
down help me find something come up with
all right 3d camera seems bad try going
around the other side
all right things have gone to hell that
sucks
I wish I understood this hacking game
like what's the goal
just hack all the hacks
I'll keep hacking all the hacks click
help
Mahad way
well do I have to hack all the things
where I just got there I got there and
didn't seem like I couldn't do anything
very confused died of the debt the
dashes I guess they only go one way that
makes sense
access granted what was confusing me was
the dashed line
all right this is store not hacked
enough there we go
what's he looking for proof that these
fuckers are lying to us I guess just
like Steve said hope seek knows what
he's stupid
all right it's got to be an iron sight
lack of a sights on that fucking thing
or killing me
I not familiar with this game I don't
know what the hell the zoom button is
hold on options controls keyboard
iron sight is what I'm assuming I want
alright I don't have that bound to
anything near me but freaky do I have
that's not what I want to know
that would probably be very handy
someday that would be very awkward but
it might work
and I need one menu button that I get
all the other menus
so
let's try it
all right
what's he looking for proof that these
fuckers are lying to us like it just
like Steve said hope seat knows what
he's doing alright how did that not hit
him what the fuck now I guess just takes
well
Wow
all right so the the tranq darts don't
last long all right we learned something
new every day
let's see looking for proof that these
fuckers are lying to us like it just
like see said hope seek knows what he's
doing
stairs give me anything I can get up
there
we'll see if I can get up there
can I like climb a thing just let me
climb it though this won't let me climb
a thing well that's a letdown
can't climb a thing
vent under stairs well that seems so
fucking cheap
vent under the stairs is like the give
up button
all right that didn't work that didn't
work
what's he looking group these fuckers
are lying to us like it just like Steve
said hope seek knows what he's doing
alright alright alright
y'all watch movie in the chat if you
want like I said this gonna be a boring
ass rich Evans solo just like knows what
he's doing
watch
fuck is that
that distraction did not work
that kind of worked kind of worked
I'll take it I'll take it
are you what kind of pick you up
augmentation in order to unlock new
abilities or augmentations you must
first gain experience in the form of XP
points you will receive these points
when completing main objectives side
quests or through special bonuses like
completing a mission without being
detected or next time we discuss
security loop once you've accumulated
enough XP points you will receive a
praxis point these points are used to
unlock upgrades to existing
augmentations and to unlock entirely new
augmentations praxis kits which can be
found through exploration or purchased
in limb clinics will also give you
instant praxis points to unlock an
augmentation or upgrade simply selected
in the augmentation screen check the
cost and if you have enough practice
points activated
all right
social enhancer what does that do
I need three so I guess I need to save
up for the cloaking is that how that
works
all right what's what's the consensus
what's good no click it clogging sucks
three total upgrades okay
Wow there's no no real solid consensus
in the chat
I can't I cannot
action activation cost to
all right well apparently I can't do
dads jack shit anyway
none of them are one I look it's magic
event I wonder if I should go through
the magic vent
I got new key virus software
what's clearance
uh yeah sure why not I don't know what I
just did I assumed it was good
access granted
yay save those save those what save
those what I don't know what to save Oh
fat lot of good this hack did meet
I get a camera well fuck
so much for hacking the planet look
house accident
fans feel so fucking cheap I'd feel
better about Vince if they'd at least
like didn't have like the one corridor
that they go through like they're
actually laid out like an actual vent
might be where they went to multiple
rooms and stuff it might feel less cheap
though it would still be cheap plus they
usually make Vince that big
they don't make people sized vents
that's just not a thing
oh okay it's a strength that might
actually be able to lift that see I
can't hack it
I'm hacking less of the planet but I
thought I would
step away from the console now
help me
some bitch
Prichard you still there where else
would I be
that's me to serif now
Adam it's David you got the Thai food
yeah but you were right about there
being something more behind this because
I've also got a dead purist in here with
some pretty interesting cerebral
implants don't touch him
I need an expert to recover his neural
hub in case it's booby-trapped
copy that I know what Sanders swats
pressure me to let them off the leash
find him before they do and deal with
them
let's watch should I just get rid of
stuff here
anyway how do i how do I get rid of
something there we go
I never said there's gonna be a
non-lethal run I never made that promise
I said I'm gonna do it makes sense at
the time
by overclocking my CPU nope I don't need
to have good CPU
well I guess duh
that is not adorable
oh then a vet
Wow that's nothing like an actual event
it's not collapsing under my weight I
mean I'm a heavy robot man do you have
any idea how fucking loud it would be
crawling through fucking vents assuming
they were made large enough for a person
to fit through now I'm talking about a
normal person what a lot a person who's
like 60% middle
shit I don't even know what any of this
stuff means
you gotta find something before the cops
busted
where's that thing I picked up
I picked up a thing
did I not pick up the thing where's the
thing I picked up
Media log
I don't see it
this is I guess this is it so just it's
not like a thing I can dig through it's
just like one message all right all
right I can deal with that and see a
passcode or anything - super useful
don't lie to me I don't want to hurt you
you're a civilian but I will if you
don't give me a choice you didn't want
to hurt anyone
you should stay home tonight Oh Lord
Seraph said that dog you're here to
clean up before the police busting
things we're breaking the law shut up
all your body polluters break laws
you're all the same you're gonna have a
hard time convincing people you're any
different wants to hear you at a nog on
your team what
I found your attack dog in the factoring
labs trying to cut their security with
his implanted hack where nice tried too
low but I would never let one of you
freaks on my crew I've got business to
take care of understand
what you say and I'm not seeing I got
some yellow yeah we're leaving you know

thing right now the boss ladies of our
moon together listen to me whatever is
going on it's big you've got a better
chance of getting to the bottom of it if
you work with me but I can't do a thing
until you let her go
are you stupid
I don't work with arms God you think I'm
some kind of moron and who can blame you
because it's exactly what I must look
like to everyone right now trapped in
here by the cops and my only option is
to take the hostage how screwed up a
snap
you got a lot of nerve consulting me
considering your success rate today you
were played for a fool you led your
people into a trap and now you're on the
verge of getting yourself killed unless
you let her go did I ask for your
opinion just now you up meant it
handsome sir as bad as the cops it's all
about who's got the most power well
right now I got the power to decide
whether she lives or dies and you got
nothing sucker
the only thing the cops are focused on
right now is the safety of the civilians
same as you
you've risked your life to do what's
best for other people you're not some
drive-by banger I know that the question
is named one of your kind to my brother
into manipulating and I have to make
sure that they get what all kind openers
deserve I'm not wasting any more of my
time arguing losing out of my ways
listen the hackers plan was for you to
die he knew there would be civilians
here tonight thought of everything he
used your brother because he knew you
would trust him that's how well he knows
they couldn't do so just like in your a
calling kill you the hell with this
you're making my head hurt without your
bullshit I'm a man of action and what I
really need to do right now is fix the
damage that was done to me tonight get
in my way and she dies what's happening
what's your situation
Adam Sanders is gone boss but I'm pretty
sure he's just a dupe somebody else set
this up damn it
welcome why are you back here now the
admin building has a rooftop terrace
meet Farina on it what about the
hostages good night there's nothing you
can do son so I couldn't save them
missed the hostages - yeah like I knew
where they were this is my first time
playing the fucking game happy Dix
clusterfuck I looked at the map map
didn't have any markings that I noticed
not quite what you signed up for is it
Jensen excuse me sneaking into your own
factory to hide stuff while the boss
holds the cops at bay don't get me wrong
I love mr. serif I just hate it when
contracts become more important than
people I thought you did too
move her body
everyone missed it
I do but things don't always go
according to plan Melek I did what I
could
I I'm sure you did you ready to go
back quite yet Melek can you wait here
yeah but don't take too long boss is
expecting you
oh shit all right note to self don't
throw corpse
don't throw corpses at the SWAT let's
see what we can do here
you say the hostages are marked on the
map
I'm not seeing them
are they in a different area
I this is a previous save
it's too late
I'm willing to go further back to try if
I can
is there a restart mission option
rich and I for fucking real
just restarted the game alright alright
fine fine
is it possible to save lady
don't lie to me I don't want to hurt you
you're a civilian
but I will if you don't give me a choice
you didn't want to hurt anyone
you should stay home tonight Oh Lord
Seraph said that dog you're here to
clean up before the police busting
things we're breaking the law shut up
all your body polluters break laws
you're all the same you're gonna have a
hard time convincing people you're any
different once they hear you add a nog
on your team what I found your attack
dog in the factoring labs trying to cut
through security with his implanted hack
where nice strike turnovers but I would
never let one of you freaks on my crew
I've got business to take care of
understand
and I'm not seeing it I gotta check
things out
Sonia la vieja we're leaving
you know I can't let you go with her
stand down sir
I told stand down no this bitches in
bullshit you're bigger than that you
don't kill civilians damn right
I'm a decorated vet and I won't be
jerked around I need to find out who's
behind this and right now the boss
lady's my only ticket listen to me
whatever's going on it's big
you've got a better chance of getting to
the bottom of it if you work with me but
I can't do a thing until you let her go
are you stupid
I don't work with arms God you think I'm
some kind of moron and who can blame me
cuz it's exactly what I must look like
to everyone right now trapped in here by
the cops and my only option is to take
the hostage
I'll screwed up is that right that's
right do you think that taking the
hostage is your only way out of here
you're so committed to that tactic
you're not seeing any other solution let
her go and you will sorry but I got no
choice I know your kind I saw it a
million times in the Gulf
the only thing augment it wounds like
you care about is gaining the advantage
just like the cops out there I'd have to
be stupid to do anything you tell me to
the cops will be looking after civilians
they're too busy worried about you
but if something happens to her you will
get their attention the priorities will
shift and all you'll accomplish is
getting yourself killed
nice try but if they're so worried about
this author lover then they'll make sure
nothing happens to her won't they draw
okay SATs go straight into the crapper
and my Master's going I'm not too dry
I'm the liquor I'm the one who has to
fix things but I can't because I'm
trapped in here
listen the hackers plan was for you to
die he knew there would be civilians
here tonight he thought of everything he
used your brother because he knew you
would trust him that's how well he knows
you he expected you to take a hostage
just like he knew the cops would kill
you for look you're right
damn you know he even asked me once
about hostages I told him I would if I
had to I thought I had to here but I
can't afford to Kenan go on get out of
here
what I did what you wanted so let me go
I've got blade here to uh say I've got
as much interest in finding out who's
really behind this as you do come home
yeah well maybe I'll go but I promise
you this someone's going to be what's
happening what's your situation
Sanders is gone boss but I'm pretty sure
he's just a dupe somebody else set this
up damn it
Kell why are you back here now the admin
building has a rooftop terrace meat for
Rita on it what about the hostages good
night there's nothing you can do son so
I couldn't save them
well fuck
not quite what you signed up for is it
Jensen excuse me
sneaking into your own factory to hide
stuff while the boss holds the cops at
bay don't get me wrong I love mr. serif
I just hate it when contracts become
more important than people I thought you
did too
sorry to break it to you Malik that's
just the way the world is doesn't mean I
have to like it
you ready to go yeah get me out of here
Malik your wish is my command
climb in
did I freeze
we seem to be frozen
we seem to be frozen si Oh as far as
like searching around and whatnot to
find all of the stuff normally I would
be all about that but I am trying to get
this game through this game quickly so I
can get to the newer game I'm gonna skip
right now I'm just I'm using this
opportunity to chat so I'm probably
gonna try and get through this somewhat
newer taxing faster than most things
with that copy that'll play through and
Jensen I just wanted to say new look
suits you like you haven't missed a beat
at all thanks
so how's it feel being augmented excuse
me don't take it the wrong way I mean
I've got a few neuro enhancements myself
discrete ones to help me fly better but
I chose to get them implanted you didn't
know that you had a chance to try it out
what do you think tell me I'm all for
spoilers can I can i hook up with this
lady instead of that Meg bitch not that
she's a bitch but I kind of like her I
kind of like this one here was Melek
I'm not gonna lie and say they didn't
come in handy back there but like you
said I didn't choose to get augmented so
it'll take some getting used to I get it
but don't be surprised if the boss keeps
pushing you to get more why what do you
mean you know how he is
he thinks augmentations are the be-all
end-all of everything and he can't
understand why someone wouldn't want to
become more than human
Megan used to say the same thing I'm not
surprised the research he was doing was
pretty damn inspired might have
convinced a lot more people to give what
we make here a try if that bastard
hadn't killed her listen Jensen I know
you want to find the men who attacked us
and so do I if I can help in any way all
you got to do is ask this is on the PC
actually there is something I want to
know this is the first attack older guys
from five years passed away
you were there that night what do you
remember about it but it was chaos first
everybody figured there had been some
kind of accident
but Pritchard couldn't get a good visual
and communications were haywire then we
heard the explosions by the time anyone
knew what had hit us they were gone
whoever they were they were good chance
a special training good did anyone else
see them the men who attacked not well
enough to get a description Richard got
some fuzzy images off one of the intel
accounts but his tapes were all
confiscated by Homeland Security
homeland
I heard homicide passed it over to
Special Investigations Detroit Special
Investigations they did for the first
month after that all I really know is
the case is still pending and mr. Seraph
is not pleased I've been thinking about
why they attacked what they were really
after
isn't it obvious they didn't want us
going to Washington no that was just
timing hearings can be rescheduled
somebody else can present Megan's
findings I don't think so Jensen they
took out her whole team
Declan ferdi Vasily Savchenko Mia Colvin
even Eric costs the labs their bodies
were found in we're burned to a crisp I
know the only reason you weren't caught
in the fire was because that retaining
wall came down saved your life believe
it or not so the whole attack was just
to destroy Megan's research so it looks
that way
mr. serif is hoping to reconstruct it
but it may take months if he can keep us
solvent that long
I'm gonna find a Melek one way or
another I believe you and just so you
know when you do I've got your back I
appreciate that now like but right now
you've got to get the typhoon into the
tech lab right see you later then
oh and Jensen the boss wants a
face-to-face debrief in his office once
it's secure
Roger that good night Malik this guy's
so generic yeah he's got gum for the
future future space
Seawolf 85 says with Jack gone could you
tell us how you really feel about him
I want the gooey details he's a friend
of mine we do prereq there would have
been no prerequisite
deck is a nice bin Jack is a great
father that's the that's the gooey
details on Jack he's a likable human
being
hehe when my car broke down
he he gave me a ride here every every
night we streamed for like was that
eight months check is jakka's good
people give me rides way out of his way
didn't ask for a thing in return
didn't ask for a thing
all right where we at
we're doing things like I said I
wouldn't mind exploring around the
building and whatnot but there's a lot
of game to get through I think it's
disgusting how public opinion has turned
on David so quickly like it's his fault
these lunatics keep attacking us
by for a second he was with purity first
I think someone slipped
well if it isn't Mahatma Gandhi himself
come to honor us all with his life
preserving presence if this is about the
typhoon I'll get to it in a minute
now Pritchard I didn't brush my neck to
have you lucid in a pile of CPUs and
scuzzy adapters well look at you using
the big words don't think just because
you hacked through the plant security
system so fast that you're an expert on
everything computer there's a reason I
can't examine the typhoon yet do tell
for your information I am running a
diagnostic sweep on our network and
router security to find out how Sanders
hacker got ahold of our codes I'd have
thought the first question I ask is
whose codes were they unless you already
know stick to kicking down doors and
shooting people Jensen and stop trying
to do my job I guarantee you will get
along better that way
security cameras there is a 95% chance
I'm gonna have to sneak through this
building isn't there
ever I find out someone internally as a
villain probably Prichard nope
am I wrong about that hello
I'm telling you you he might not have
put the gun in Sanders hand but it was
Taggard speech to the UN that started
all this William Taggart is nothing if
not a shrewd political operator you know
that David so for the sake of
appearances they have to look him in the
eye and let him bullshit me with a smile
always with a smile
she talking to us ghosts later
I didn't know I didn't know ghosts were
in this game yeah you wanted to see me
yeah are you feeling I've had better
days while we were done here checking
with dr. Markovic at the limb clinic
downtown and her to get a checkup
if you insist listen about Sanders yeah
about Sanders what the hell were you
thinking letting him slip away like that
since you in there to take care of
things
I'm hoping they'll pay off for us later
Sanders was furious when he found out
his hacker was all invented he's not
gonna rest till he finds out her set him
up oh and you're naive enough to think
he'll share the information when he gets
it I thought you were ready for this
Adam I am today's attack was just a
shell game being run by somebody else I
intend to find out who and why so that
it never happens to anybody again good
cos so do I that hacker
in Sanders group you're sure he was
augmented tears cables out myself
yeah well the police are saying he's not
refusing to let me see the body no
matter how much money they threatened to
pull from the experiment Helen oh no
well maybe they didn't like being held
off so long at the plant is that my head
of security speaking or the ex-cop
listen Adam I don't want to squabble
about this I need you to get to the
bottom of it
you still got friends in the force you
think you think one of them will let you
into the morgue to pendulum run in to
get over to the station and find a way
inside because if that hacker was
augmented his neural hub might tell us
who he was contact me when you've gotten
a hold of it you got it
your office
turn around why should I turn around
because I missed the stairs
to your office
Adam Jensen
this whole thing just brings back bad
memories I love working here but it's
hard knowing that in any second
mrs. Reid Oh madam I'm sorry you
startled me and please call me Cassandra
you and Megan were together long enough
I was waiting for you out here
why not come meet me inside I don't know
I guess I'm just not ready but this is
where you work but to me this is also
the place where I lost my daughter
I guess I never thought of it that way
I'm sorry it's not proper of me to come
here and stir up bad memories especially
after what you've been through
yeah a lot of things changed six months
ago I can't get over how much they've
changed you at first I couldn't even
believe you were still alive
how do you handle all of this
they did what they had to do to save me
and in a way I can do more now than I
ever could I'm glad to know you take it
so well many of us wouldn't be able to
cope so easily with such dramatic
changes in summer but I you haven't
played much of it yet sorry
I'm here about making about what
happened to her or rather about the
investigation into what happened what
about it well simply put I feel
something is not quite right with the
way the case was handled you think there
was some foul play involved
I do call it mothers intuition but when
speaking to some of the investigators
there were a lot of inconsistencies and
then I met this detective a man called
chase he agreed things weren't handled
by the book although he has no proof and
now you want to find out more I'll never
hear my daughter was African at him I'll
never get a call from her to ask how
I've been or have the chance to ask her
about her day she was stolen from me
however unjustified this all is I still
want to know why it happened
you're not the same Adam and we've yet
to see if it's of a better or worse but
I know you loved Megan please will you
help me find out what really happened to
her
I never got a chance to investigate the
attack myself I'll look into it
thank you this means the world to me
Adam
really the first thing I'll need to do
is meet with this detective chase god he
works part-time as a security guard in
an apartment building on Brooklyn Court
I'll be waiting for you in your
apartment lobby once you're done
why does a detective need to work
part-time as a security guard
oh he retired soon after the case I
don't really know the details but maybe
he'll tell you more I'm on it
yes I got run of the city here nice neat
I take it blew our sight missions which
is which
all right this is my first real day of
sex experience so tell me something
honestly I am
it's a crazy notion to think I'm going
to get through this in one evening I'm
gonna guess this is a longer game am i
right about that
yeah okay okay
definitely not happening in one evening
mass effect okay 40 plus hours Wow not
that that's a bad thing it's just I I
dedicated yesterday to getting through
this that's not gonna happen that's not
a problem all right so you want me to go
to my office there's no reason not to
fuck around a little bit then let's go
to my office
Adam Jensen please report to your office
Adam Jensen
this must be a lot better than new one
for what I've seen it looks like the new
ones getting mixed reviews or am I wrong
about that
there is oh I'm in the next floor up
yesin remember me
hey Jensen man it's good to see you I'm
glad you're back
how are you holding up I managed I'm
sorry about Megan I know it must be hard
for a while we thought you were a goner
too everything's going to shit
the attack on HQ and now this mess with
the factory yeah
tough times all around how about you
Corel are you okay I don't know I I
fucked up I mean bad what happened well
a couple of months ago me and Tyndall
you know one up Richards Tex
we started sneaking out some naraba
scene from one of the labs Jesus Tim you
realize this could get you fired
worse arrested if the company chooses to
prosecute what were you thinking I know
it's just it's complicated I didn't want
to do it at first but there were good
reasons anyway now I want out but
Tindall has security footage of me
stealing the stuff and says he'll expose
me if I ever stop helping him I'm in a
bad spot at him I need that footage back
I know you're busy with everything
that's going on right now but I could
really use your help
pretty ballsy stealing a patented drug
from a secure lab how'd you manage to do
it
both Tindall and I worked the night
shift every other week I've stashed the
neuropathy in a bag while he edited the
security footage guess he kept part of
it neuropathy what could you guys want
with an anti rejection drug for
augmentation patients reselling it
providing a competitor why do you
automatically assume I was trying to
turn a profit how about $10 can't you
reason with him you could try but
Tindall is a pretty driven guy I mean
that guy's like a rock you need a Casey
odd or something to crack him Casey
social enhancer it's an augmentation
designed to read people's reactions and
behavioral patterns higher end series
even allows you to directly influence
people with pheromones or something
now that's just ridiculous
and I should care about this because
damn Adam are you really gonna shake me
down like this that's cold
I'm hurting here look I may be able to
get my hands on a weapon mod for you
Jesus never thought I'd have to buy your
help
what is it exactly you need me to do I
need you to get back that security
footage Tindall has on me it's probably
in his apartment on his computer man who
stole Ross I'm just looking for getting
mad at me for taking him down it might
be tough to get in because his building
has a large security gate protecting it
well that's just great hacking the
security gate is possible but would
require advanced hacking skills you
might have to look around for an
alternate path maybe use the fire escape
or something all right tell me more
really Wow
thanks Adam I thought I was done for the
security footage will probably be on his
apartment computer meet me in front of
the subway station parking lot once you
get a hold of it I got it from here
right does all I needed to see in the
place
for me to have a place
yes sure
all right and how come I don't know my
own past is there a way I can get my own
password do I have to hack my own
computer how do I get into my own
computer
probably probably via that
you just you just keep that on your your
desk huh huh huh huh you just keep it on
your desk all right that's fine
that that doesn't make any sense you're
the security guy you're you're the
security guy Jensen why why you just you
just left it on your fucking desk head
of security
136 for okay
not the only thing on them yes
why do I have two computers oh this is a
hacky heck heck
well he's gonna need probably a bit too
much going on to fully get into it
during a stream gonna read out all right
you know what here around the other side
sure
Adam Mary I don't mean to bug you on
this but I think I've got another
suspect in those in Europe the Naropa's
element you mean to get through thefts
my Cod Denzil Mitchell going over my
stack of versalife purchase orders he
said he needed to verify the legal
address for a contract David want her to
look over well that was part of one I
said that weirdly because I didn't I
didn't realize where the rest of the
sentence was going but he'd have that
address at a dozen correspondences all
ready for lawyer you think he'd be able
to come up with a better defense store
code is one 364 by the way leave
great aw nice I'm gonna look at my
augments here we go I I tried looking at
my augments before I don't have enough
magical augment points to augment my
augment now I got to know all right I
guess I got a I got a upgrade something
or other it's fine so I guess that's
just done that's fine
I can use some words more better
well it still I'd already updated
updated social I'm sorry I'm sorry yes I
am Donald Trump I have the best words
close the fucking door there you go
presentation in Washington the UN
wouldn't even be considering
restrictions we don't know that
all right I understand that the boss
battles in this are very hard so with
future augmentations should I focus on
on combat because I don't know I could I
could I could trust my natural stealth
abilities and not get stealthy upgrades
and focus on on badassery and I'm
assuming if I do side missions I get a
bunch more augments to augment the
augments you can you can talk your way
out of bus fights
oh if you have the director's cut you
can non-lethal the boss battles
interesting interesting
I mean I want a kick I like stealth
here's here's the deal
I like stealth but I'd also like to kick
a little bit of ass is that is that too
much to ask to be able to kick a little
bit of ass here and there maybe I think
some boss or another is especially a
prick and I want to beat him in the face
that's that's the thing I should be able
to do right just a just to beat the shit
out of somebody
can I take a cab
this is game not half cabs all right
we're side mission is this will this
shoot at me if I walk in here I don't
even remember what side mission this is
I got nothing for you
check with the man keep your hands where
I can see them you got anything you want
to buy or sell I'm the guy you want to
deal with everything's on the computer
right at your fingertips
always a pleasure
apparently what I need is just behind
here
Grayson hook me up with some real time
guys whose door I got a sneak in the
drug with footage this would be a fire
escape I don't see a fire escape where
you going for the main fucking door fuck
it fuck it okay I don't think this is
that mission I don't even know what
mission this is that's fine
hello there well you must be Adam Jensen
Oh observation mrs. Reid told me you
might pay me a visit this is that man
don't take this the wrong way but you're
kind of hard to miss I'll try to take
that as a compliment she told me you
might have information regarding Meghan
Reed's case and the attack on Seraph
headquarters oh boy what a mess total
pissing match we had the feds on our ass
orders from three different departments
and pressure from so many lobbyists it
felt like being the scrawny new kid in
the prison shower it is a very
high-profile case mrs. Reed said you
thought some procedures were overlooked
you got that right I mean you know how
it is mrs. Reed told me you used to be a
cop there's always cases where you see
the lazy officers taking shortcuts but
this this was different
different how too much stuff got
overlooked people seemed way too eager
to jump to conclusions and every time I
was remotely insistent I got turned down
by ranking officers people wanted to
bury this thing fast that's never a good
sign surely you have something more
substantial than this yeah well that's
where you come in I got a couple of
leads I could never fully investigate I
started poking around but these
government type agents just gave me the
creeps I got scared months away from
retirement I didn't want to fuck things
up but you you obviously have the means
to get to the bottom of this so what
have you got first off there's a rumor
that the order to close the
investigation came from higher up maybe
even outside the local department
anything like that would have passed
through captain pin there might be
traces of this left on his office
computer yes I'll have to pay a visit to
the local precinct well while you're
there there was an officer assigned to
the case Chet Wagner he's not what you
call
oh boy and when he suddenly got brought
on the case and I got suspicious
somebody wanted him there and I'm pretty
sure he tampered with some of the
evidence you should talk to him find out
what he knows okay I'll have a little
chat with officer Wagner you'll most
likely find him in the lobby
he got retrograded from his conduct and
he takes depositions now he won't budge
easily but I'm pretty sure you can find
some dirt on him on his desktop his
office is on the third floor he might
find something there to help loosen up
his tunnel anything else worth looking
into
yeah when the order came down to close
the case the bulk of the evidence was
stashed in a storage locker maybe you
can find some interesting stuff in there
it's on the alley right next to the
station the court is 40 48 91 but I know
an outside agency had access to that
locker so be careful thanks for the
heads-up max it's nothing and oh please
don't bother coming back here with
details don't get me wrong I'm glad to
help but the less I know about this case
the better I'll feel
48 91
so what is the alpha beta Omega thing
mean what did that do for me what what
the hell did that do for me
yeah what a personnel attack what what
does that get me I don't I don't find
you said an outside agency may have
tampered with the storage locker what
did you mean by that well I've seen I
mean I've heard that government agents
may have locked up some of the more
sensitive evidence and a safe inside the
locket come on chase what are you not
telling me damn it
okay listen I snooped around that locker
before and found the safe code but I
kind of got caught by one of those guys
he knows I know Jensen if I give you the
code they'll know I talked call me
negative but I can't think of a nice
outcome to that why retire from the
force only to become a security guard I
mean it looks like you still love them
work I love the idea of being a cop ever
since I was a kid I wanted to join the
force but I just got fed up it's not
like I had imagined it it's a job some
people are good at it while others just
don't care and it shows this case the
Seraph case it was just the last drop in
a cop already full
yeah how did you get assigned to this
case I didn't push for it if that's what
you mean to be honest I didn't want to
get me for zero why now I wasn't honest
you're four eight nine I always try say
induct myself in accordance with the law
with procedures and what I believed was
right not really the standard mo for a
case like this
I want that safe code and you know I
have the means to make you talk if I
want to look I've been threatened by
mobs just gangers pimps and dealers for
40 plus years and it's not like I gave
you nothing so come on now there's no
need for these unpleasantries I didn't
seem to work
wrong choice is a bit up but Omega kept
flashing through his conversation is the
social thing just useless you have to
help mrs. Reed find out more about her
daughter

or he's getting less that's
what's-his-face oh right here my pocket
okay ah gas station down the street all
right all right I got it
I understand the thing that happened
that it made perfect sense to me
let's drop that in the middle of the
street that's fine
map
where is the gas station
I don't see a gas station or a standard
bass station
I'm not gonna be streaming to live eat
the game cuz apparently that's gonna
take a long fucking time I could sell
the guns I didn't know that
where'd I drop it
alright alright so what's this about f2
I don't see it
I don't see where I have to hit the f2
the shop is the gas station okay
Jennsen what are you doing here I think
you know why I'm here Tyndall I want
karela security footage back you don't
know what you're talking about
I'm Sarah industries chief of security
I'm pretty sure I can find out about an
edited security tape so don't bullshit
me shit
listen Jenson I never wanted things to
get this bad I'm not a bad guy
I feel for karela I really do but
sometimes for a good cause you have to
get your hands dirty no there's a good
cause now no I see you think I'm selling
the stuff right I understand why this
would seem like an obvious motive
especially to an ex-cop but trust me you
shouldn't always take things at face
value I'm not selling the new Rafa scene
I'm giving it away giving it away to who
to the people who need it you think
everyone gets ah cumin tada choice
no shit happens and then what you're
saddled with neuropathy injections for
the rest of your life and that shit
costs money but what choice do you have
without the drug you'll die rejection
syndrome crippling pain that just ain't
right
so I did the only decent thing to do I
stepped up
all right which one is which
I can respect that but blackmail is
still black now karela wants out and I'm
here to make sure he gets out man this
whole thing is becoming way too much
trouble
I've even got to local pushers on my
back because they say my philanthropic
actions are undercutting their profit
that's not your only problem a
gun-toting client was waiting for you in
your apartment earlier really in my
apartment
shit the dealers probably sent him tell
you what I'll deal with the client later
you take care of the dealers and the
footage is yours
all right that second conversation I
didn't see anything light up he was he
was alpha before so I'm going with a P's
look you're right you're in a tough
situation I wish I can help you out of
it but it's your mess right you're the
one who's got to step up and do it he
sounds just like my old man
you're lucky I respected the dude here
here's the footage guess I got to face
the mess I got myself in
can I shoot the drug dealers anyway
that'd be nice
my god I got somebody fucking sidequest
going on here I know where half of them
came from
did you get it yet Adam please you have
to get that security footage back I got
the footage you owe me one two yeah you
got that right Jenson I mean thank you
so much this is my life I just got back
here there's the weapon mod as promised
you're lucky I don't report you to serif
I ever catch you doing anything remotely
shady like this again and I won't be as
forgiving you get that yeah I get it
and for what it's worth I'm really sorry
that's right cleaning up the streets the
filth and the scum all right where's the
shop where's the where's the where's the
sell my shit shop
Bartman's police station apartments why
isn't one labeled shop because they sell
things at the shop just call one shop
I just want a soul stuff for fuck's sake
there's the gas station and the linen
clever
why is nothing labeled a gas station
firm I know
area
how may I be of service
always a pleasure
leave me alone oh man Eliza is so hot
you crazy
Adam you got that neural hub yet you're
asking me to pull off a heist boss
inside a police station it's gonna take
time right well if you can't talk your
way past the lobby there's got to be
another entrance outside and back or on
the roof save the frontal assault is a
last resort
all right
something
can I get this
ah
Oh more the shit
yeah that's not gonna work
it's probably how I get out from
wherever no idea no idea
and yeah you still watch this crap my
boring a solo stream
I'm gonna try and get to this game
there's no way I'm gonna do it there's
too much going on it's not a bad thing
there's an other box yeah that would
work it doesn't feel right it feels so
stupid but but
don't mind me I'm just the Box guy
close the fucking door
today students attempting didn't do it
in
okay
oh good oh good he did give me that
there's no way she's actually dead yeah
well damn it
I guess hacking is just super important
in this game
cannot close the fucking doors
the stealth expert of me wants to close
the fucking doors nothing over here
Oh
right right
sewers chant why this this thing like
this seem like it work just fine
you don't got a vent drinking game
ah that makes sense
he's gonna come back in the
or is he gonna stay there he might stay
there seemed risky to pick that hack
that door
I don't believe we're gonna get to a
full playthrough on stream this is my
initial thought but it sounds like this
games got way too much to it
dragwon event
oh I can drag with a vent all right I
like that that's an appropriate use of
vent at this pace it would take me 50
hours she had no doubt no doubt
nope that's probably the way Southwick
that's the way I came from that's the
way I came from Mallory
wait do we have a bot in the chat that's
a first to my knowledge
oh you found this tough so rich will
struggle with it all night well fuck you
too
oh god I'm so sorry sir
saw me last time
was it just bad luck
oh wait
all right and they just automatically
come the second you try to hack because
that's annoying
I'm sorry okay
look I'm not familiar enough of this
game to know how the cameras worked I
figured if you're not within the green
cone you'd be fine I think that's a
reasonable assumption
alright who's fooling around
police get on the ground
so this camera
they see
damn you hacking
I guess we'll have to vent it
apparently hacking is the only thing
that matters in this game
right I give up
I surrender without my surrendering here
here here
I surrender now what arrest me are you
gonna you gonna arrest me hey hey I'm
ready to be arrested now oh no oh no I
guess I am black
oh you know quite a bit of range on that
access granted
a great who'd have thought who would
have thought automatic unliking
unlocking device I'm like a man that
sounds good
let's take all the money
Oh
oh my lord
this is insane is granted
yeah
so that was the thing I need in here is
I doing do what I needed to do in here
well sure thing I'm missing why is this
little blue arrow or sad on the other
side of the hall no way that's down
there oh that's the different room never
mind never mind
apparently the key is just vent vent all
the time vent vent vent vent oh by the
way you remember those vents
I'm not gonna read all this stuff during
a stream I'm gonna scan through it real
quick just in case I'm gonna code should
pop up
what's
well that went perfectly
hi that's what I'm doing
well they're never going to calm the
fuck down are they
I'm a little bit fucked here I think Wow
Hey
they give up really damn easy what
this is some dump
better stay away
you know what you know we're gonna do
- era in person
I knew that was gonna happen
all right
all right let's see if I'm gonna Floyd
avoid fucking that comes around the
corner lousy cops which could slip no
sugarcoating it oh no I'm horribly hurt
Troodon what Oh
it's gonna have a heart attack and he
finds out it's possible to talk your way
through honestly I kind of want to just
do some stealth stuff
yes and possibly people well I really
want to kick cop ass
I am so beating the crap out of you like
I am beating you up so hard that your
mama's gonna feel it
that arm break was totally necessary and
1000% justified
saving this kind of for wimps but since
you're all impatient for me to save
there
patience attempting to access the second
Avenue
the pro-human organization hate received
maybe I can find them Wow fuck my under
it
think I'm under it
nice
so that hack 3 is pretty important huh
and I want all the hacks
of course
we're gonna stay here until I get some
answers kid we're talking about some
serious fucking crime crimes what are
you talking about me my brother's
missing and you want to charge it
typical all right let's try this again
when was the last we saw much
that's worth a shot it was it was worth
a shot
I'm not using the full keyboard I'm
using my number pad I don't trust it's
fine everything's fine we're gonna stay
here until I get some answers kid we're
talking about some serious fucking
crimes crimes what are you talking about
man
my brother's missing and you want to
charge alright let's try this again when
was the last time you saw lucky and who
was he with
I told you it was like a week ago we was
hanging it with some old friends old
friends listen no you both used to run
with the Motor City bangers we know
Jason is gonna be and we know he's into
something yo you got all there is no
occasion okay smart mouth how does all
trafficking grabbing just I felt like
playing Deus Ex maybe the D are bees are
having a chat with your brother right
now now you've got nothing to say I've
got all day
you did bang in a table and not saying
anything
no we're gonna stay here until I get
some answers kid we're talking about
some serious fucking crimes tell you
what here's me Moreira sheet I have
anything in my inventory that will do
that
and is it actually full
oh wait a minute it was wait a fucking
minute wait a fucking minute
genius
I need more of that shit
all right you gonna make me read it
first hopefully that is
91/2 for the morgue nothing for this
yeah that's so nauseous
so obnoxious
all right so the first upgrade I should
have gotten was not the Praxis it was
the the uber head
I'm pretty sure it's gonna want to it's
only been wanting to
which
which one is this just one one this
as same as this
that's wrong
we're gonna stay here until I get some
answers kid we're talking about some
serious fucking crimes
this is the one I want right the analyze
add-on which is the one that upgrades
the hacking the right hacking this is
the right one or is it oh okay
okay well never mind then
heck heck me access granted
should i hack this computer because I'm
assuming that will open this door
thank you
yeah which no at least I get that
I've got a mine that a fucking mine I
think I want a combat rifle yeah I
definitely want a combat rifle for you
sir what do you do can i I see what
you're talking about with that now with
the f24 quest
that's a big gun in it that's a big-ass
gun
no no leave that
move oh wait there we go do you know
what I want all the stuff upgrade
oh that sounds that sounds super
important super important what scrap how
many guns will please me all of the guns
all of the guns
Kiro take something
cert button flip it's got to be a way to
flip something right
I think that was a good hack
no sorry here's why I keep going to the
that menu right because I have a button
on my mouse bound to escape and like a
reasonable adult who's played a video
game before I expect escape to take me
to something like an inventory menu but
in this game there's a whole separate
set of menus from the option menus which
makes no fucking sense
alright laser sight the rifle - the
tranquilizer rifle with a combat rifle
which one which one should I use it on
yes for speed I have a mouse button
bound to escape for speedy closing of
anything you got to remember I don't use
the regular keyboard when I when I game
I tend to use a number pad which is just
like it's just like that far right side
of the keyboard is just those ones and
that doesn't have an escape key on it
I've got like the keyboard it's off to
the side somewhere I'm not using it
usually when I gave
I mean I wouldn't have to do that iron
sights with this laser can't go on
tranquilizer
oh well then never mind never mind that
solved the problem handily
yeah I should probably pick up some of
the stuff something else neat was just a
mine alright
way to cysteine
collect all the things
let's just get down there all right
access granted
all right now this is going swimmingly
all right there that's where most of the
shit is
so we need to get sue I am there
do they notice open grates
Oh turn around you find he has pirate
I'm not gonna run fuck away ma I'm going
the exact wrong way well fuck my ass
far easier than it should have been far
far easier than it should have been
situation at sheriff industries resolved
regardless
it's the first solo screen you've seen
and you're loving it I don't believe
that I don't believe that ah not sure
how much longer I'm gonna stream here's
the thing that's kind of a deus ex
virgin and this isn't a bad thing the
gameís is pretty deep and that's a good
thing there's a lot to do this game is
not a quick playthrough so I don't think
I'm gonna play this all night Mike my
current plan is I'm gonna finish up this
police station section and then just for
a variety I'm gonna switch to Orcs Must
Die because that's an old favorite of
mine till I beat the game is just not
realistic not realistic
Aaron was a cop in the other
access granted all right I think I'm
getting a feel for this game by the way
well the users terrible you're terrible
at this game did you play for the first
time today you're terrible still saved
the Beast yourself okay feel bad at this
game why isn't the instantly good of the
game I've been playing this game for
five years that I'm great at it
alright alright I guess we just book it
to go
I made this harder on yourself access
tonight
what nikka supposedly the very first
deus ex is great which i have not played
wait how's this after okay
yeah let me make sure this is after I
got all my goodies yeah this is after I
got all the goodies and went the wrong
way
I remember that I thought he would keep
walking for a little bit he didn't he
didn't do that
it's worried a fuckface hurry up you
fuckface you fuckface fuckface
what's here come on out oh they reacting
to the open dorm I didn't find
hey I love I love hiding bodies in the
vents
I don't like how cheap vents are for
stealth games here but does it appeal to
hiding bodies in vents I can admit that
full of bodies when I'm dead
an extremely regrettable fairy much like
what's here come on sheriff in person to
offer my deepest sympathy yeah
apparently I shattered I'm what I meant
to do the thing the other thing I've not
played the original Deus Ex
you get the spacious vent and I like you
all right there was that
she's taken out
it's like ice Patrol like yeah he's
gonna keep catching me when I try to
hack in that door I'm gonna have to take
him out but I got no vent to hide him in
I equivocal deplore the methods used by
these hostage takers
now that being said do hope the UN takes
a concentrated look at what happened
I know intellectually this won't work
does this open
I'll be damned that did work get out of
my way
that's great
what's going on
and in here
we really need to get out of the menu
faster after I hit the button game
body hiding stuff is great I love it
when stealth games let you hide bodies
why is that going so fast granted okay
it's like that clothes don't need that
already got in the armory so it's all
fine that's when I killed me last time
nope didn't love that
access tonight
they're saved
yep
and try one more time
access granted
two four one nine
Oh
all right
access granted
let's fill our nope nope that was dumb
that was dumb dumb so dumb I never said
I hated overwatch bit too much of a
clusterfuck for me but that doesn't mean
I hated it
access granted
let's the alarm Oh
hands where I can see them Janson shoot
me after I surrender
all right so I almost certainly don't
need to go in there but I need to get
over there which means I need to find a
vent I've learned that much about this
game
and now it's event the game we put it up
Vince in this game I put some more
events that's a clever way around vent
that only goes there all right like here
this that's a normal fucking vent that's
slightly large and I can't fit in there
but if the only way I can do those last
two objectives is by going through the
front door then fuck this game honestly
fuck this game that's terrible
that should not be
hey how are did you see it on the news
Eliza mentioned
what am i doing I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing oh they use the result
rifle I meant to use the tranq fuck it
bullshit bullshit
are you saying just walk in there we'll
try that we've tried just walking in
there here we go was a demonstration at
the live really how come last time I did
you freaked out was I did not like the
fact that I was ducked that that is so
weird oh that was just the front
entrance well son of a bitch gentlemen I
have a message for you from one of your
former colleagues a detective
Alexander Jenny what did you want she
said she could use some help if you can
make your way over to Grand River Road
and might I just add as wonderful as it
is to have you back at the office I am
NOT your personal dating service wow wow
wow wow
Wow but if I run though they freak out
if I run in a sprint
what the hell really really yeah
somebody explain that to me
can you explain that to me explain that
to me
why do they shoot me then you got what
you wanted I did yeah yeah hang on just
a sec shit Jansen huh surprised to see
you here yeah well I guess you're better
at looking out for yourself than I am I
don't have time for your self-pity I
need to get into the morgue that's it
not forget it I don't know what's going
on with that body down there but my
orders come from the brass no one gets
in first thing you say to me after
almost two years is you want something
should I have given you an order you've
always been very good at following those
yeah damn where do you get off being so
self-righteous you think I like this
look at me from SWAT team commander to a
crummy desk sergeant in the two-bit
precinct I don't need this from you I
get enough of it at home so either come
up with something better than your usual
attitude or you can just forget it
because you came to me
you think I knew you'd be here I'd have
been just as happy without ever seeing
you again believe me but I need to get
into the moon so just open the door and
stop getting in the way when innocent
people are in danger you don't get to
bully me Jensen you're not my boss
anymore
I don't have to take your crap not after
what happened two years ago you dropped
the ball and I wound up here you are not
taking the rest of my life for me now
get the hell out of here and don't come
back until you grow a conscience
don't put this on anyone else we both
know the real reason you're stuck here
is that you feel guilty about what you
did and until you face up to that this
is where you're gonna stay whoa that's
harsh
everything goes back to that day I shot
a kid but he was dead before I did that
he chose to make himself a weapon and he
could have gone to us like tissue paper
with those augments of his personality
side that's Alex you just can I take can
stop paying attention to it
Wayne are you getting careless that
empty pill bottle in the trash over
there didn't you know antipsychotics are
included in the force's zero-tolerance
drug policy I only need them until I get
things sorted out you can't do this it's
not right to use them against me the
fire me if they find out I'll lose my
pitch and everything but you would
wouldn't you
fine you're cleared I'll tell the guys
to let you through but I'll never forget
this that's a promise okay
that hole not right now that hole meter
system kind of sucks because instead of
paying attention to the dialogue the
only thing I'm really looking at this is
light up indicators and for a game that
has a strong story component that's a
terrible idea
second Avenue limb clinic found their
route blocked by supporters of the
humanity front movement the pro human
organization has hurt so where do I need
to go now
wait that's outside I thought there's no
like or that I already do all the things
I need to do in here

ordered to wait for tell Manderley I
didn't get the memo until I was halfway
through the autopsy by then it was too
late to close him up again right so you
recovered the neural hub tricky bit of
work that was a few inches lower and the
bullet would have fried more than just
the pedak connectors as it is I can't
guarantee you'll get anything useful out
of it other than the fact that it's been
modified modified with what some kind of
wet drive but eh I didn't look
ultraviolet means ultraviolet and I know
how touchy you guys get when it comes to
matters of national security
