[Part I]
I'm going to play the unloved Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the shadow
out of the shadows game and I like it
nobody else does except for me but I
like it and really that's all that
matters
how's everyone else doing I'm now you're
doing good that's good I'm glad you're
doing good I'm fine I'm just fine and
also split Asst thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
all right this is not a solo stream Jack
is going to crash in on the party round
round 8:30 Ronnie oh this kids bedtime
and we're probably gonna have to pause
the stream and fuck around with audio
once he gets in because there's no way I
could adjust for for Jack leftover
beefcake thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it seven months in a
row uhme remix thank you for subscribing
and it's your one-year anniversary
twelve months in a row holy shit we were
doing this crap for a year
thank you for subscribing for a fucking
year I should start the game now I guess
right I mean that's a thing that you
probably happened all right here we go
here we go I'm turning this game on I
was fucking around with earlier we're
going to the main menu nuts well yeah
the main menu item why the fuck not
going up going to the main menu and the
sound in my headphones is pretty loud
huh how's the sound and everything
we're sounding good this is probably the
song I should have started the stream
with this game keeps kicking you out of
full screen mode and I don't know why it
does that it's it's kind of annoying
kind of annoying keeps wanting to go to
windowed mode well you want to loosen
this song for good will you listen to
this song for a bit yes these turtles do
look better than the bay turtles
actually on my my Steam whatever I did
post a picture of the screenshot of this
game saying you know this is this is
what realistic Ninja Turtle should look
like why all right you're asking me why
this game is good it's well it's got its
got some technical flaws like this is
the first time in years I've had issues
with a camera in a game I mean cameras
are something that mostly gotten figured
out well so this game you know it's a
little buggy at times but I like to
combat the combat is I would describe it
as a hybrid brawler
like like back in the day old old rulers
like God of War and Ninja Gaiden were
like combo based you've learned the
moves and then you use the moves in the
game and then Batman Arkham Asylum kind
of took a different look at brawlers and
Batman Arkham Asylum turned brawlers and
it kind of like a a rhythm based keep
your combo up and and this game kind of
blends both like there's there's there's
a counter button like an Arkham Asylum
there's a combo counter and would you
get the combo high enough you can do
special moves just like an Arkham Asylum
but there's still there's still a combo
system like in like a ninja gaiden I'm
still in control of what moves I use so
it's like it's like right in between
that kind of old-school ninja gaiden
call our add up Arkham game alright
start the game
and there's the the lair it's kind of an
odd game in the way that clearly things
are based on the the current Nickelodeon
cartoon but they they made it look
realistic like it's it's kind of based
on a TV show that's meant to be enjoyed
by 10 year olds but they're still trying
to appeal to 30 year olds which is fine
actually I kind of discovered the
Nickelodeon show because of this game
and actually a really big fan of the
first season of the the current
Nickelodeon Ninja Turtles all right I'm
gonna start the campaign chapter one
sure ninja mode I don't know classic
mode I think that just makes a black and
white which is a cute touch but we're
not doing that
and I'm Leo fan are the TMNT superheroes
no they're ninjas who happened to be
Turtles
we buck bebop and rocksteady you're
pretty good in the new show yeah I never
much cared for bebop Rocksteady here's
here's my Ninja Turtles bias okay when
the Ninja Turtles came out when I was a
kid I actually my first my first
experience with turtles from the toys
themselves
I remember the toy commercials and I
remember the toys and I remember getting
a few of the toys and I thought they
were really beat and then I start a few
episodes of the TV show I mean I like
the TV show when I was a kid I liked it
well enough but then I watch a this is
actually this is a more important story
this is the story of how I came to love
comic books because the local comic book
store this had the Vino quest at the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles all taking
that was epic comics Friday after school
right my treat with me I would go to the
comic book store and I would play the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game
from playing the arcade game at the
comic book store I eventually discovered
the big black and white Ninja Turtles
comic books and I was like oh my god
this is fucking awesome I love the
original comic pick turtles the black
and white turtles for they all wear the
red headbands a lot more than I like the
cartoon I kind of hate the the 80s 90s
cartoon
too cheesy for me even when I was a kid
it's too cheesy
especially when they had to stop using
her weapons I couldn't stand the fact
that the the villains of the cartoon
show were all idiots can't can't stand
my villains being stupid here we go and
then I'm playing the game I'm not
talking bush you know what fuck it I'm
just gonna I'm gonna declare this a no
death run it's a short game it's doable
hey guys it's very doable
and if I'm not talking enough from you
briea Jack shows up at 8:30 listen talk
button which is kind of neat you get
bonuses for the taunts like Leo if he
taunts like before the start of invited
some people start hitting each other all
of the turtles get like a damage boost
Raphael does a taunt after he gets hint
he can regain health
they gave each character their own mood
scent and a little bit of a little bit
of personality
nothing we're fine here all quiet carry
on
definitely enero actually hitting not
robots with a sword yeah and in the
comic books
Leonardo was not afraid to hack somebody
up like the The Foot Clan in the classic
black and white comics yeah they were
they were not robots and well things got
bloody and it was it was good fun now as
a kid I like r-rated entertainment
violence is a grand thing
okay I give up what the heck is all this
stuff this is amazing high-tech stuff I
could build almost anything out of this
could you build a robot yeah could you
build a flying skateboard yeah could you
build a pizza uh let's cut you here -
yes that gets a pizza oven but wait that
smells awesome pizza
stay focused Mikey we got to catch up to
those purple dragons don't don't use it
much but there is hey we are stealth
mechanics get down guys behind those
dumpsters
okay they're leaving look here's a
purple dragon headed down the alley
aw the poor guys all by himself mine
and that gets a way that fucking fiends
get out of my way Michelangelo
and stealth stealth initiated
it's down
do you know that ninjas are supposed to
be quiet
nice these guys let's head for higher
ground right here and Raphael ofcourse
is appropriately brutal his attacks all
look like they hurt look at this look at
this look at that knee to the feet of
the fucking space rebels we give a shit
of course they all get to a secondary
kind of weapon in this game and Rafael's
of course just iron iron fucking gloves
come on come on
one piece of me
all right moving right along you want to
break somebody's arms this record he's
got a probe a guess technically he's not
breaking the arm I think it's supposed
to be a submission but looks an awful
lot like he's trying to break somebody's
arm which Pelley appropriate for a feel
they are but did you seriously just say
holy cats
the bigger they are save it turtle time
I love this life get out of the way
nice
I'll see you can switch through the
turtle tempte anytime obviously cuz I'm
doing and I want to do a counter-attack
fucking attacked me they're afraid
they're fucking afraid of me they should
be
look you're out of bag yeah I just
started a little bit early you didn't
miss much
this is he okay first stage fairly early
on in the first stage yes it's there
Nick stop their next takedown
hey I've arbitrarily decided this is
going to be a no death run it's not
gonna be innocent it should your case
being especially challenging no death
run yeah why not even faster and stay
out of sight
why not well of the way they run dude
even ninjas need fuel
yeah parkour beware my parkour
oops
all right I haven't used my key yet have
I
these might give it that's a knife
you know you boys shouldn't play with
sharp things and definitely don't relish
it
boy have I learned that
down he goes yeah you did that some
celebrating
let's get acquainted
whoa come here Punk
and welcome to the stream rich loves new
Keith glad you could make it for a
change your first time can see what all
the fuss is about and you get to be
horribly disappointed
seeing the camera is not perfect in this
game usually it's not even it's not even
good but I like the game anyway
in part because I really do like combat
me also because I really like turtles so
it's all over but the falling damn chump
right now my best that fight not my best
though splatoon I don't own a wii-u I
don't have splatoon the purple dragons
hey I cannot play splatoon for a number
of reasons
it's the tcri building what I can't
figure out is that company belongs to
those rich loves nuki thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
why would they be jackal jackal be here
later first first hour this is probably
no gonna be rich soulless room then jack
will show up
a bit of stealth action here
oh yeah
hurry up
you fuckers
Monni I figure out what's going on take
him down I'll take him down there we go
a video game AI everyone hang back a sec
technically this game is supposed to
have co-op online co-op this is their
valcon now this is the major reason
everybody in the world except for me
hates this game it's supposed to have
co-op it doesn't work so they fucked up
big time
big time they've never patched it
they've never tried to get it working
before and people are rightfully I mean
you know me yeah I don't give a shit
about multiplayer though in this one
instance I think it would be fun you
know no multiplayer for this game
we go
ninjas always
that shellshock why do they call that
show combinations
check this out I needed a step sale
come on everyone saw that right
pouring it combination stop okay
that's that
shell-shocked sorry I'm too busy kicking
ass the time she's kicking ass it's all
good
aliens now what's what's even happening
I'm playing the Ninja Turtles game the
unloved Ninja Turtles game and Dad no no
Karen today Jack will be by later if I
know I know I'm kind of quiet when I'm
alone less than an hour from now Jack
should be around
any opinion on The Witcher 3 not not
really
I couldn't even play the first night the
combat in the first one I hated it so
much I couldn't I couldn't play the game
so I've never played any of the other
games in The Witcher series I'm sure you
know I'm sure is great couldn't get past
the first one
all right
bring it come here that's the turtle way
down in the tunnels come in it this way
use Leo levels got a rapper bit got the
pizza here
and not gonna be self graph isn't subtle
graph would not use Dolph he would you
know he would what he was doing he would
just charge up to somebody and punch
them right in the face
oh yeah
yeah yeah come here yeah
this new hacking device Donnie made for
me
Steve the mini-game portion of the game
how you open the doors had a turtle get
out of my fucking way get out of my
fuckin get out of my fucking way yeah it
would be great if you could do co-op
technically it's it's there's a menu but
you'll just you'll just never be able to
connect to a game it's never happen
anybody actually has this games and
knows of a trick some way to get the
co-op working let me know maybe maybe
before the day is out we'll try I don't
think anything will come of it but we'll
try
we got company let's go
check this out
you know have not been able to do any of
Raphael's crowns little ground moves
because these people keep dying to write
and seem to be doing fief work for the
foot since when is that I'm sure in the
later levels they weren't died what has
gone it's not baby
scars so now they're made out of tissue
extremely well then again I am I am
playing I'm not doing this playthrough
from scratch well I'm not nearly fully
level I gotta do some upgrading on Donna
yet
I was looking at the chat finally I'm
sweating into a wall
everyone now really
let's get acquainted
but son the next X con game excited
they're making one
hey better thoughts on it in the last
stream we did I don't want to spend a
lot of time going over again because I'm
just gonna end up repeating self every
every stream we do I looking forward to
out of weather making one I want to I
want to see some gameplay footage though
before I actually really say much of
anything about the game take me
Wow fucking camera that was sweet
nobody here
subway tunnels I've never even seen them
on a map come on there have to be about
support sections of the subway
but apparently shredder is eating entire
sections existence from everyone else it
is a personal subway system no cops no
Transit Authority
you're telling us this why well they
could have a secret foot soldier
underground city
they could have foot soldier malls and
and foot soldier boutiques a foot
soldier movie theater foot soldier kiosk
selling foot soldier cell phone covers
come on back Mikey
right now there might be more info
floating around there on next time -
right now all I've seen is the new
trailer sorry this is the employee train
fellas we're gonna have to throw you off
I'm sure I'm sure I hear tales well here
we go all about its royalness suspense I
guess so I know so which which TMNT is
this game based on well I probably most
closely resembles the current
Nickelodeon TV show and it's more mostly
it's it's own thing
not bad guys
Oh
where's Ben Alice he's on he's on Skid
Row
analyze is on skipper let's find a way
out
need to regroup and figure out what's
going on
I'll show you the upgrade stuff on
so the green means they're unlocked so
I've got most those things unlocked
which kind of violence lake are
decreased health
I have no idea I have no idea
yeah we're doing that one it's fine it's
fine stop fine you're up fine choices
leave it be
what are the chances of my singing the
80s TMNT theme song zero zero like I
said I was a fan of the comic books less
so of the classic TV show look at this
they have a mode where they all have the
red headbands like the classic comics
for the sake of you watching this you
can keep track of who's who I'm leaving
it off but it's neat they do that
where do I see the TMNT and 500 years
under a pile of radioactive ash like
everything else has to come home I
believe he said we were exhausted and
needed rest so we're just going to
ignore Master Splinter everyone cool it
whoa whoa hold up what pizza we got
pizza okay more than okay Pizza Shh
hang on I hear something it's more
purple dragons okay everyone keep cool
what'd you guys get cut off from the
rest of them
rich doesn't even think will last 500
years yeah look after we developed nukes
we barely lasted 20 falling down Chuck
I'm in 20 years after we discovered a
way to destroy ourselves we almost did
it
what's the deal with the subway what are
you working on at some point in human
history somebody else is going to use a
dupe whoa I'm living feeling it's gonna
happen sooner or later subway get out of
here
forget it it's a bust you just you just
need the wrong people to get their hands
in a pot back to the lair we must and as
time goes by that's gonna get easier and
easier because the information is out
there and other people are trying to
develop these weapons our trail but they
know we were moving equipment through
the tunnels I am I should have any a
list of recent subscribers I'll go back
and read everybody when I get a break
I'll do it after the end of the day both
to the segment be right I have just the
thing
Arwen Jack calls him ever comes first
you swore the crane technology would
make your weapons
invincible do not let me down
why not just cut across the rooftops
it'd be faster I want to stay on a site
there were foot soldiers all over the
place tonight this way
time you start kicking some ass
it's something they do look like dogs
that's right conceptually I like ninjas
in this game they're not that they just
gotta eat
I missed I think I got everything moving
right along the masters are coming from
someone try to find the way to the
source
Mouser side hey Jack how you doing
I'll say hi properly I guess once you
actually call him but not gonna see in
the chat I'm just gonna say hello
awesome ninja weapon
face time come on oh there we go jump
down the fuckin hole how much how much
every how how difficult is that could
that be just jump in the hole
where's everybody still up here get down
the hole and let's continue on hey these
guys are competent their competence
they're not hitting things with sword
stabs they're competent
all right
power surge
break them down
PETA I mean more pizza but still
wife dial
everything'd I say you win games
everything dies and you win
all right
that's all of them out spin break him
down
victory dance so that was more mousers
want to fight people again
watch this
kick people in the face that is that too
much to ask
they just wanted to kick people in the
face I mean it's it's a ninja turtles
game that should be a priority
it's all over but the fallin down chump
that's the turtle way
bring it
come on come on
- Stockman is around here somewhere
Baxter and I don't like the idea that
they usually are
I think he's backing up the foot
for core
this is no ordinary tunnel nothing here
is as simple as it looks
do that bouncer explode on purpose
watch this
Ravager
Croucher
that's
yeah this one needs a reason
come here spin
here we go wait
what's this
it's all over but the fall and damn
chump my brothers watch this
I would kick things over here
I still miss kicking people
or at least people sighs things come
here
it feels like I'm beating up like
chipmunks
wait what's this
the trick is to inspire without sounding
like a fool
stuck on the stair there
no thanks I'm all set not not cool
looking to get stuck on the stairs
embarrassing but yeah
outstanding
Electrical ninja net
all right this few more being hurt
can you hurt turtles you can in the
world of mousers apparently
we go
yes
that's getting it done
grouchy
should be building up better combos in
this no fucking I'm doing fine powder
combos combos yes like in a video game
when you hit something a number that
goes up the top of the screen that's
your combo combo yeah I'm not talking
about the snack just wishes harm hijack
how you doing
you sound fine in my headphones now the
question is how do you sound in the
stream I thought I got rid of that when
I tested things can you hear me in the
stream can you hear it
yeah oh yeah I spent like an hour before
the stream getting rid of that and I did
and so it's just back yeah you Oh for
fuck's sake if they my headphones and in
the stream and it's not that bad in the
stream but it's there you know what's
causing it what the game when I recorded
without the game on it's gone
yeah Jack sounds good Jack is a bit low
I can turn myself up oh my god it's
getting louder rich
maybe it's because are you joining in
it's it's that do a thing
it's like crescendoing well I don't know
I don't know what to do I could start
and stop the stream and just hope it
gets better by magic
I could try turning the game audio off I
don't know what's more objectionable
that's the question I mean I'm not even
sure if that would work well I mumble
wasn't on when I tested it earlier yeah
maybe maybe that is maybe mumble is the
cost I don't know well I mean before
before I actually started the stream
that the buzz was that wasn't gone but
it was very low the game when I turn
when I recorded with the game off the
audio was crisp and clear if you see
yeah
power strange
I don't know what to do yeah Oh Oh God
Oh
I'm going to Hey yep right because I
minimize the game really really yeah by
the way that's it I don't hear it
anymore moans yeah it's the game I was
playing around this flank an hour and a
half before you showed up on that before
you show up for I even started streaming
so it's the shocking rich the what's
going on with this game I don't know
there I'm turning you up
really
how does Jack soundcheck actually we
should talk talk now Jack sounds weird I
I think I think we might be having more
mumble issues maybe we should try Skype
again oh all right I'm gonna I'm gonna
turn mumble off and I will see closer
just call me at Skype okay

[Part II]
all the time no I'm just gonna keep
playing the fucking game I don't give a
shit okay I don't give a shit you know
how about this we just we'll just don't
scream and just play the game in we farm
so you're saying the problem is the chat
the problem the problem restraint is
trying to scream this is it you know the
chats not the problem it's just us
trying to stream this chats great
everything's great everything's great
all the time
oh that does sound noticeably better
well good
yeah that sounds so much better Wow
okay so shank what we're playing tonight
yep
why not watch it hey shanks great we we
are a big fan of clay yep clay - ank
they do mark of the ninja which is a
great game very they they do invisible
ink they helped out with crypt of the
necrodancer yep they make fine games the
people over in Kuwait I'm gonna die yay
I'm totally gonna die is this a no
different no not anymore I haven't died
yet anyway
so it's still not a no death row great
so so Chang super fun yeah you play a
little bit you you had me playing for a
while I forget oh yeah they that's right
they also did don't starve which I have
not played yet but looks looks fun do it
you guys should play don't starve
together oh yeah that's right they've
just had like a multiplayer expansion
for down starve all don't starve
together so yes that's a great idea for
a multiplayer game I will add it to the
list I don't know if you know this which
but I've started an official list yeah
time I have an official written down
list of games and we should play on the
stream it's right it's right next to my
spreadsheet of shirts that I wear on
best of the worst well hold on we know
let me write this down don't starve
together which is uh what's what would
you say this genre of don't starve
together is I've never played don't
start actually a channel what would you
say this genre of don't starve is that's
what I do in my list I write down the
game at the genre the system is on and
whether or not we own it that's who
that's my that's my Google Docs
spreadsheet of games the official games
to play spreadsheet
roguelike servo survived
don't forget demon souls demon souls is
already a little dim
okay brutal doing great so finalized
okay great steamed so little bit yep
I don't I don't starve nope I don't shit
your pants no definitely I think we can
do that okay great
I've added don't starve together to the
official list
to be official but that's great good for
you that's a good thing oh yeah
sometimes I mean sometimes I do big
things like write down less the bankers
those are good
Metal Gear Rising I don't want to play
in that on your game twitchplayspokemon
I'm sorry they're not my thing
wait rising those differences Verizon is
a fast-paced action game where you run
around with a sword
okay and I'll be rising
oh yes and I also have dungeon of the
endless on the list I know we got gifted
that recently and it's already on the
list because I know we should play it I
would like it
Metal Gear Rising and just put it on the
list because you could be mostly because
we've run around with the Thor I mean by
the same people who did vanquish it's
like vanquish for the sword oh yeah oh
well then I'm you know why don't you
just got me interested that how's that
for you that's that's acceptable it's
moderately acceptable great that's great
I think I'll take better photo
I just yawned that's terrible I'm fine
though portal 2 is on the list of course
of course portal 2 is on the list
we have a ton of those like multiplayer
games that we will so that we always
like talked about wanting to play in
straightly like you know what work
together and trim and it just never it
never happens because the list is
already too long where we're we just
can't kids everything but do we have a
list anyway right it's not something I
think about much who's speaking of I did
just today just earlier this afternoon I
was playing a little splatoon rich good
it's interesting very interest not good
i I don't know yet I only got a couple
hours I got a couple hours in and I love
the idea so far you know cuz it would be
the thing wistful tune is it's a
third-person shooter and instead of
shooting I mean you do shoot enemies you
shoot other players but the main goal of
the game is to cover as much territory
of the map in your ink as possible
and I love that but like I don't it also
has this thing where you have to play a
certain amount to buy new weapons and
buy new gear no no well that's not
standard multiplayer bullshit that's
standard Call of Duty bullshit yeah and
I haven't been so I haven't been playing
along enough to like have fun with
different weapons or with different
loadouts but so far just the like I
played four matches online
and loved it okay and I can't wait to
get more weapons but I I can only
imagine that like there will be a sort
of tedious element where it's like I'll
be playing stuff just to get money just
to get new weapons like a grinding
element to it can we afford it we you as
a business expense
yes we have enough in the budget to
afford away you as a business expense
suite we have other people join us like
that's super fun yeah but it's it's
interesting so far and it controls a
little like ass
I haven't fine-tuned the controls yet
they have two options for the controls
one is you know just standard shooter
with the joysticks right and the other
is you do fine-tune aiming with motion
controls yeah and of course that works a
lot better yeah
these are fine-tuned this motion control
because you can really aim if you're
holding up the thing but there's some
fatigue involved oh you have to can you
use a Wii motor do you have to use the
pet I've only used the pad so far but
you can use I bet you could use a weevil
that would work really well
oh you're right maybe I should give that
a try I should give that a try
how about moving and turning not like
human but mine actually turning around
you turn slower well then that's the
thing is is using the so here's how it
worked with the gamepad is you turn the
still with the right joystick but then
like just fine-tune aiming was with
motion controls and there is an
adjustment slider you know a sensitivity
slider and I didn't get a chance to play
around with that too much they're like
fine tune right aim but so so far I'm
interested so far I do not regret the
purchase is what I will say okay okay
that's my official endorsement so far is
so far at four hours and I do not regret
the purchase we'll see overall Gatling
gun but it's very interesting it's like
but here's the other thing is so far my
matches have been wildly different you
know like you start out it's levels
right and you start off at local AMA
and my first match had some level ones
as some level eights had some level
flowers yeah and three out of my first
four matches I was top ranked on my team
at level one really so I'm not sure how
they do matchmaking me out
which is interesting gobbledygook sign
I'm not shilling I'm giving you my first
impressions of the split you're only
shilling if you get paid to do it right
make injection Tendo I'll tell you that
oh sure
no and and this is not like I'm not
officially endorsing it I'm just saying
so far I'm feeling okay about my
purchase when a reviewer enjoy something
that's not shilling even though I guess
it's not an actual review it's just oh
this is not an official review it's just
how I feel like it like I said hopefully
everyone understands like how you feel
four hours into a game is not
necessarily how you feel can only handle
and understand extreme impressions
extreme opinions
you're right subtlety is dead you're
absolutely right you're absolutely right
listen I'm not I'm not I'm gonna be
playing some more because I wanna I want
to get into it I want to learn the maps
need the most fun thing so far is the
movement system if anyone remembers the
the trailer or knows anything about
splatoon you have two forms you have
your walking form with your gun and then
you have your squid form
yeah and in your team's colored ink you
can move faster in your squid form and
you also hide from your opponents when
you're in squid form in your own ink and
so there is this really fun like
movement mechanic where you're in squid
form you pop out you shoot a little bit
you go back into squid form it's very
it's very interesting
so we'll see if it holds up we'll see if
it holds my adventure her for anything
longer than four hours
this is brainless yet fun action you
know I'm just yeah I'm just hitting
buttons and he's whipping out like a
chainsaw that's great
switch into a shotgun is why the fuck
not
what are you guys talking about it's
gonna that's someone in a chance to talk
about stuff they always do
they always do
right telegin wants to know about our
favorite pilot episode do you have a
memorable favorite pilot episode of a TV
show Mockingbird Lane it didn't get
picked up but basically Bryan Singer
rebooted the Munsters okay name is Bryan
Singer directed it and what's the guy
the guy who did like me think he wrote
it
dead like me
Bryan Fuller thanks oh okay
that a Munsters reboot yeah basically
you use something very different taking
the characters they went dark with it oh
sure
the thing I will I will add to this is I
know everyone has varying feelings on
the entire series but I submit to you
that the pilot episode of Lost is
fantastic is some of the most fantastic
television
I remember now the rest of the series
obviously I have your opinions on that
but the pilot episode is wonderful
gripping well-written
established characters I don't know
where that it's it's great I think I
think the pilot episode of Lost is
phenomenal I've never seen it
oh you I mean I recommend just watching
that because you know the rest of this
guys don't want a bunch of questions
with no answers the reason the reason I
didn't watch it is cuz everyone's
talking about that first season and I'm
like yeah they got no idea what the fuck
they're doing don't want anything to do
with that they didn't I just said that's
heartbreak in five years is what that is
it was fine
I I thought it was fine because you know
the basically the issue that people have
is they set up all of these questions
and then over the years decided not to
care about the answers to those
questions but instead care about the
characters and so the ending was just
all about the characters finding closure
not necessarily about all of the
questions they set up yeah yeah and so
on
oh that's better that you're you know
what you're right stick stick lords the
pilot episode for The Walking Dead
oh yeah that's the best timing will be
ever made that's the that's the best
zombie movie in recent years absolutely
that's a great pilot
yes I want defend I have defended lost
before this is not a new thing me
defending once settled on everybody just
do a little bit of settling down so oh
yeah mr. trash man oh of course I got
the DLC for from Mario Kart 200cc new
maps and characters new carts of course
something I was thinking about as far as
the new Mario Kart DLC we got another
episode on map and I don't know if you
ever played I'm looking up what it's
called now I want to say was called like
f-zero maybe GX was it is that what it
was that's here of GX yes
f-zero GX for the Gamecube was this
really great racing game
underappreciated in my and modern times
you know zero basically all of the stuff
they do in Mario Kart where it's like
anti-gravity riding yeah that's they did
it in f-zero GX and it's super great and
we had two f-zero cards now in the new
and Mario Kart and all it does is make
me want a new f-zero game because
they're just they're just hectic races
are great
I'm not entering hipster mode I'm always
in hipster Moeller get it together dude
first apparently because I said f-zero
GX was great I'm a hipster because I
call well maybe because I called it
underappreciated but no one talks about
it anymore I have zero GX was fantastic
there's a good racing game if you like
racing games I have no strong opinions
on the matter there you go
biscuit updates he's around why would he
need updates fine no he's fine biscuits
great all the time the it's getting a
little warmer and so he's not digging
that shame down sure he's basically the
only update on biscuit is he's been
spending a lot more time in the basement
where it's cooler and then like when I
when I come home he'll like come up the
stairs and you know at me and then go
right back downstairs so
I guess I can't even believe that f-zero
GX is obscured it's a good game someone
in the chat was saying you know Jack
like something obscure chat calls him a
hipster and he's close to a shot come on
but I didn't know his obscure if I'd
check it out it's a great racing game
yeah FZ was fairly big Nintendo friend I
guess
he didn't grow up with a Super Nintendo
you might not think so yeah maybe f-zero
is just some weird thing people now sure
mecha P that could when will our LM we
do a reality show probably never
probably never wasn't there was just
there's just a really great article
about the death of reality TV really
yeah both Netflix and Amazon streaming
have canceled deals with major reality
television producers because nobody
watches them through through Netflix and
Amazon so you know obviously they don't
want to pay to to host them interesting
which is just a and of course you know
so many people are getting rid of cable
and getting rid of the super channels so
it's it's signaling an end to the
reality TV era which is fantastic as far
as I'm concerned because it's nothing
but garbage television yeah
I'm very excited about that oh shit ah
fuck first F oh wow this far in that's
great
I chased pretty great I'm amazing you're
you know what you are counting the Ninja
Turtles game this is my first death of
the night would get that Ninja Turtles
game won't figure it out somehow you
said that game is kind of notoriously
buggy though yeah yeah I mean it was
released as a budget game I'm just never
supposed to be a big fancy right
well it was $20 new sure but you would
expect that it like the audio report yes
that's just a normal thing it was made
with love but not skilled no I think
that's that's the reason that's a
horrible thing to say it's a true thing
to say
sure sure it's still a horrible thing to
say
have I ever played the classic poor
player Ninja Turtle arcade game yes it's
about masher and you die a lot it's not
really about skill it's about getting a
game as many quarters as it wants there
there are probably those people who did
not grow up turtles in time is better
than the classic original oh yeah
turtles in time is great I can be like
you if I have a decent partner I can be
turtles in time in 20-30 minutes
fun event fling pony I want to say
that's my best time - 27 minutes turtle
since I'm on the Super Nintendo but yeah
like maybe if people didn't grow up like
around arcades there are so many of
those games brawlers oh yeah like every
single franchise had its own brawler and
most of them were terrible most of them
were quarter suckers
was it Turtles or wasn't one was I'm
trying to think of one Simpsons was out
okay Turtles was a big one obviously
Simpsons was was the turtle sucker oven
it was the Simpsons was the quarter
sucker of note as far as I'm concerned
just because it ate up all my quarters
x-men x-men had an arcade
if that was a big one final flight of
course maybe final fight was the first
one yeah final fight was out for his
final fight was great I loved final
fight that Long's final fight it was
great it was and I say it was only I
only say it was great because of
nostalgia because I pardon me you know
playing as the burly Mayor loud it
I did i exploited an apology's doll for
my aweful sneeze I did try to get as far
away from my microphone as possible not
far enough
oh hey rich yeah you play in these
sports games not really I watched some
sports but I don't really play any
sports games yeah pretty much I don't
care about sports games I don't I also
just don't care about sports MLB power
pros in the Nintendo Wii is the only
sports game I've ever spent any
considerable amount of time with okay
which is just a fun kind of cartoony
baseball game I remember putting a lot
of time into mutant league football yeah
which I'm still I'm still looking for a
decently priced copy of that because I
remember it being amazing and it was
like a football game but with what
zombies and monsters in the shit yeah
great as the name would suggest yeah
Wednesday oh by the way Wednesday I have
not announced this yet I'm gonna
announce it on Monday but I a heads up
for Wednesday stream we are doing a
earlier euro friendly stream on
Wednesday what do we play I want to play
by the way it's not one of the A or the
decisions for if Jack was gonna take
over I was quickly rebooting into my
window side of my computer I was either
going to play Witcher 3 or Fallout New
Vegas yeah
and my thought was new bankís before
Wednesday yeah just start up a game you
and I'll play it and and we'll do a like
start at like 3:00 3:30 new Vegas not
three I think New Vegas is the good one
is what I've heard really I think I
thought three was was the reason many
people were interested in New Vegas
three was three was pretty popular
all right they might like them both I
don't know still there
did we lose Jack lost Jack getting Jack
back jack is returning Jack Jack Jack
hold up hold up Reese Kuip awaiting
relating this problem with the internet
connection great great I even still
streaming or did this whole thing
collapse like a house of cards like a
poorly made house of cards all right can
I be heard because I don't know what's
going on
oh good because because it's cursed
because the stream is yeah oh my god
what about a funny spot ended what it
would have been funny if they could have
seen me in the chat just feel like rich
I'm calling you I thought about it
though
oh of course now this has been something
that's been happening for maybe the past
couple of weeks where all of a sudden my
my oh my god I'm forgetting the name for
the box in which I get internet from my
modem Thank You Wow
completely lost the name for my modem
just I hear a loud click I hear click
click that's not good there should be no
moving parts fucking modem so this is
what I this is what I know
so I hear a click click and then all
internet dies and that's what happened
and so all of a sudden I'm talking I
forgot what I was talking to you about
but I was telling a story and I was at
mid story and it's like beep boop boop
boop yeah
and that's that so but I'm back now so
it's just I had to restart my modem and
and AT&T; is getting an angry call
tomorrow
now I don't need a router I need to do I
think I need a new modem you had our
modem for a couple of years now so maybe
it's worn out I don't know so oh that's
right that's what we're talking about so
Wednesday we are doing a European
friendly early screen we're gonna say
yeah we're gonna start at 3:00 or 3:30
and with all of the fallout 4 talk I
thought we could play one of the older
Fallout games yeah and we can play
fallout 3 but I had heard that New Vegas
was better I work and I don't know
also someone gifted me a copy of New
Vegas and so yeah we have a copy of New
Vegas which is the real thing
I shake somebody to death okay shake
them shake them new Vegas please yeah
that's all we're gonna do dick we're
gonna we're gonna so we'll do New Vegas
early what what did you all machetes how
is that even how is that better
how is that better yeah dual machetes
cuz it's dual machetes you know what
while you were saying dual machetes your
character for me had a chainsaw and I'm
trying to think of how like you would
make two chainsaws work in real life
well he's only using one chainsaw oh I
know I know but that when you said
machetes my my mind heard chainsaws
really yeah only because I was looking
at chainsaws so Wednesday early stream 3
or 3:30 central Daylight Savings Time
that's our euro friendly stream we're
going to be playing Fallout New Vegas ok
that's the plan and we'll a google
stream until whatever that is that is
the official plan for because I do I
have been hearing more and more from
European listeners saying that they want
a more regular European friendly stream
and we should so we're gonna try to
figure out a way to and make that happen
more often so they can be in on all of
these wonderful technical problem
you know who is attending the stream I'm
rich and I will definitely be there yeah
it's quite possible but most likely just
us but it's possible that Jay will be
around and usually that's it you guys
know how these things work if J is here
doing something most likely yes actual
stuff right Jame H and J might show up
later but or not at all yeah these are
the real things Shetty's why are they
not dying faster well and that's the
game I had on my a B list sorry Colonel
Bert's mustard so a a was Witcher 3 and
B was Fallout New Vegas yeah I just
ignored shake yep love you know doesn't
work and and by the way both I would
have had to like download and install
both I have neither ready to go that's
just like I would have just been doing
that while chatting with you guys so it
was good that rich wanted to play shank
so that was gonna be my energy because I
someone did gift me someone some very
generous that gifted me a copy of
Witcher 3 which I have and I've heard
nothing but good things I just don't
have the time commitment to play it
unfortunately still haven't beaten
blood-borne god damn it I can't start a
new game we have things to check your
okay
I know I know but that's the thing is
like you're seeing what we have to do in
the future knowing what episodes are
coming up and what we have to do is like
I just don't know if I'm ever going to
so what's next week
no next week we have free and then and
then we have III and then we have an
immense the week after 83 okay I wanna I
want to say next week we have free to do
the early access episode the early
access with Karen in town I still have
to get to you know I I got I got a
little bit of invisible ink timing it's
a lot harder than I remember
I think they made it harder yeah yeah I
just and like I just didn't know I
didn't know if it was like actually
harder if I just like if I'm out of the
flow of invisible ink
but um I guess maybe a little bit about
yeah I I definitely like I switched over
to no to playing some necrodancer so
yeah that's that like the next episode
is an update the to early access games
we did with the necrodancer and we're
just about to fake - I was but as it's
like we just won't have time like we're
through with all the other games we have
to play
so it'll just be invisible ink and crypt
of the necrodancer cut it and it'll be a
fast one it'll be a nice short episode
just kind of like here's what it was an
early access here's what it is now
do we still recommend it yeah right okay
I'm done with it as a short upset I
don't know if I could do detail anything
to games you've already done exactly
well that's that's just the thing it
just so happens that these two games we
did in early access and now they're both
out for full release so that's that next
one we're gonna do a best of the worst
style III episode III of the works maybe
I don't know in which and that'll be
another very short one where we will
watch rich and I will watch the
conferences live and film and make jokes
because I'm sure it'll be nothing but
jokes maybe there or no the ExCom to
talk at some point somebody
and then Batman and then Batman's the
next big one yeah
problems my guess is both of the other
ones both like the early access and the
e3 will be like YouTube only videos it's
kind of a shame that they're both
back-to-back and not and that book ended
by a some kind of full-on review of
something that's how it works sometimes
that's how it works sometimes something
else biggest coming out lying
that's it that's the only thing I have
next shit I got
a Lego Jurassic world yeah that's the
next big Karen is looking forward to
Lego Jurassic world check to Center the
camera no I just went to the other side
of my office I'm still here how you know
those Lego games I don't know if I can
be down with them we've been we've
there's been a lot of Lego Batman here
recently yep and they're all the same
game yeah oh yeah they're all the same
game and I dig the idea that the actual
game was just about like collecting all
of the guys you know just unlocking all
the guys but III did the game is so not
there and it's not for me you know what
they've been advertising on Steam it did
what it looks like is basically lego
minecraft I saw they might actually let
you start building stuff now exhibit
they've been terrified to do that
because they don't want people to stop
buying the actual Lego bricks I think
that's why you haven't seen a game when
you could free build whatever out of
LEGO pieces and we'll see if that is
this or if they still worm their way
around that you know
jack-jack Oh fuck's sake Jackie still
there no no holdup trying to get the
call back jackass drop again Jack has
dropped again
well this night it's just this has gone
great everything's going great this is
my favorite Stream Legos Legos scared
jackoff Legos Legos made him leave he
can't he doesn't like Legos so much he
can't even talk about them

[Part III]
I want mobile to work I want something
to work tonight this is this is the
cursed the cursed scream of curse Cygnus
this is the kerstin cursed done stream I
heard so many amazing things about
mumble and it just hasn't worked for us
and we have these weird issues with
Skype which I hate obviously but you
know and now my modem are you fighting
them poacher yep that's great that's
great
choking him with a meat hook because yes
why not
why wouldn't you meet books right
well yeah in twitchplayspokemon the the
audio is great but both rich and I get
echoes and obviously that's unacceptable
and so that you know like right now it's
like do we have echoes throughout the
entire stream or do we just stop and
restart the stream every time this guy
flips out because skype flips out and I
would be the obvious answer or Skype but
I want mumble to over to because the
audio quality is so much better and he
can't figure out why we're echoing and
last time rich and I did a test rich had
on his can headphones and I had on
earbuds and so it wasn't any bleed
through from the headphones just it was
just a weird echo it don't make no sense
it don't make no sense I know it's my
internet my my modem freaked out again
the cell that's gonna be most of
tomorrow is figuring out my internet so
many apologies on my part for my bad
internet I'm using headphones I can't
speak for Jack so it's not because I'm
not using headphones I'm using Ed votes
oh yeah no and I have you bugs like the
the echo the echo thing is not anything
to do with like the microphone picking
up on our headphones it's some sort of
hardware problem and we don't know what
it is and everything is terrible but for
the night check out space cap demo let
me know if you want a legitimate version
Oh somebody did a spacecraft quest game
oh do they yeah well they day I don't
know if there's much to it I look at it
a little bit before the stream strange
oh how did you know about it there's a
link in the chat there's no this stick
Lords link it again
I mean I kind of saved the link on my
desktop
good right now no sticklers link it
again now I want to see it
I don't think rich has seen come the
fury yet which have you seen country and
I I watched it like five minutes and I
got the joke and I got bored
I mean that I mean absolutely no
disrespect but I just got a little bored
I'm sure it's funny sure it's great but
I just got bored
which place Bochum on says maybe the
echo is due to mumble outputting to
multiple devices which are all being
captured by OBS which could be which
could be but then just figuring out what
it's outputting to and what OBS is
picking up on you're working on it thank
you
stick Lardon stick lords i have the link
oh my god and i all i see is the outside
of the PCI repair shop and I love it
already that's all I see and I love it
already as soon as I will play this
after we're done with the stream tonight
and I would like to know stick Lords
send us the impressiveness information
at previously recorded dot our LM at
gmail that's that's the email that that
I check send us your information twitch
plays Pokemon
we tried virtual audio cables and
apparently rich and I neither rich nor I
are smart enough to understand how they
work because all that did was cause more
problems virtual audio cables make no
sense people use them people use them to
cut me they make no sense to me at all
do you need another program to run
virtual audio cables because I have no
idea how they work can you type it oh
sorry stick a letter told us
or it is not our LM ER at gmail.com they
go that's our email for now I thought I
asked Mike to give me access to B we
have a prereq at red letter media yep
email address
and I just don't have access to it but
that's that's a way more official than a
gmail thing yes so phones fight it up
don't worry Don I'm sure I'm sure she's
gonna have some kind of second forum or
something that's going way too smoothly
that's that's always the thing like I'm
winning I'm winning this boss but I
shouldn't be winning yeah
oh no I like I understand everyone I
like I understand the concept of what
virtual audio cables are but both rich
and I downloaded them to get rid of this
whole echo problem to get rid of this
whole like volume control problem and
neither one of us could figure out how
they work
yeah I'll talk to Mike again next time I
see him to give me access to the to the
red letter media and prereq email I'm
sure I brought it up at some point it's
fine why not just use Google Hangouts
because the audio quality for Google
Hangouts is worse than Skype
oh that's hardcore
what the same shot right that mm-hmm
unless their second form is a ghost I
think that fight is over
Oh
are they go
easy P you know that is that the
easy-peasy
so what's new I'm trying to think I
think yeah you know what I started
watching recently is a true detective it
was very nice
only into I know I'm three episodes in
and it's very good and that Matthew
McConaughey is a fine actor that's all I
have that's all you need that's all I
mean it's it's not it's a nice slow
detective story you know where they take
time to kind of show the actual work and
I think that's that's a nice thing whoa
congratulations should make life lessons
so this true detective is very nice
trying to think of anything else that
I've been doing I've been really Wow
don't get shot by somebody else I've
been really enjoying this boiler for our
early access ketchup I've been really
enjoying crypt of the necrodancer yeah
just just you know I was trying
invisible ink and not having a lot of
luck with that so I was just picking up
that today crypt of the necrodancer and
it's just just nice it feels good and
the music as soon as that it's like it's
like world one to that music for world
one two is so good it's the best what do
you think what do you think I haven't
even got marry you haven't even gotten
there yet I'm still getting into it are
you kidding
I can barely beat blood - I'm dead I
have died
oh no you died
play any terrible games lately um no not
terrible you know
that's all I have I'm sorry I mean you
know it the only terrible game I play
lately is Lego Batman I think it's
really bad I think it's a really bad
name it's Lego Batman 2 and I get it you
know they're meant for small children
you get to play as all of the characters
in almost the entire DC Universe you can
play as every single character and I get
that I get like kids are super into it I
fucking hate it I think I think it's an
atrocity gameplay-wise okay but but of
course I'm a I'm an adult I'm not their
target market
oh you know what I can talk about rich
what is your history with Godzilla
terribly much okay very rare no and then
I would see like like Mothra type movies
on TV when I was younger
okay but I call myself look at Godzilla
fan boy or anything why okay well movie
okay and I haven't seen the new movie
I'm not a Godzilla fanboy but I like the
old Godzilla movies I'm a big fan of men
in giant rubber costumes destroying
obviously the small fake cities yeah I
think they're hilarious
so recently over the weekend my youngest
my four-year-old got a Godzilla toy and
of course he has no idea what Godzilla
is really why would he do four-year-old
yeah why would he know a Godzilla is and
he's been having so much fun with this
Godzilla toy that I decided it was time
it was time to introduce the boys to
Godzilla and so last night we watched
Godzilla 2000 which is you know above a
pretty reason but still like kaiju blue
like still still like men in big
costumes Godzilla noise and they fucking
flipped out over Godzilla destroying
cities and fighting giant aliens that
were also kind of gone
guardzilla it was great yeah it was
beautiful
and I was so happy especially like my
younger if my four-year-old is really
into being the bad guy and really into
being monsters really of course is good
that like that's all he wants to do is
just like be the bad guy whenever we
play anything right
and so he's super into Godzilla Godzilla
comes into town wrecks everything and
goes he's like Godzilla's the greatest
the only problem was we get midway
through the movie and it's Godzilla
fighting an alien spaceship okay and the
alien spaceship shoots Godzilla and
knocks him down like it isn't hurt does
it he just knocks him down
so my four-year-old starts crying really
he starts crying and goes but he was the
best bad guy because he thought that the
alien spaceship killed Godzilla no no no
he's fine
and so then you know of course got to
look jumps up and he's fine and the
relief on his face it was cute well it
was it was just like he loves being the
bad guy he loved monsters and so we got
to watch a big rubber puppet suit
monster movie with the children last
night and loved it just loved it there
was one bad word yeah and I don't think
they noticed I gotta go the good
scientists called the evil scientist an
asshole nice yeah
ask classic
and I don't think they noticed but
beyond that it was it was a phenomenal
night and I got a couple I got a couple
other movies that I'm ready like I have
Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla because
that's the real one like Godzilla
fighting a robot version of Godzilla
that's the ultimate right that's the
ultimate Godzilla movie and you know I
got I got Godzilla versus King given and
Mothra I can't wait to start teaching
them all the swear voice here's the
thing rich yeah once they save their
first swear word it's all over is it
or are they just become adults and these
words mean nothing just their swish
exactly well that's the thing once they
learn their first way of it like it's a
big terrible thing that will ruin them
no one else will get hurt I just said it
I'm not a monster
no but like once they learn their first
one then then we have the official life
these are words that you should not say
in front of other kids they're gonna ask
why can't they say them and they're
gonna have a great point no no the
reason why is because it's not always
appropriate to say these words why not
what is magical about those works what
is so special about those words and then
the power we have given them some people
find those words offensive and it is why
isn't the conversation what's wrong with
these people
why isn't that the conversation Jack
tell me I want to know I need to know
because in general it's good to be nice
to other people and part of that is not
going out of your way to offend them and
these words while they're wonderful are
superlative like they're not necessary
to say there are other words in the
language that we could use to express
our ideas that are also non offensive
and in general we want to be nice to the
people around us
it just blew Rich's mind I know I'm
trying to think of it an example it's
like so we don't need to use those words
all I mean you don't need any synonyms
then why don't we just start cutting
words out of the dictionary why don't we
start cutting words out of the
dictionary it's shielding them from
something that's going to be a normal
part of their life space absolutely but
I mean as children the act of killing
children from those words is the very
thing that that gives those words their
power well that there just works wholly
sure but but again this is the thing
where it's like a child does not
necessarily possess the power to discern
when it's appropriate to use these words
and back to our conversation from five
seconds ago I believe there are some
points I don't I don't understand and in
the greater context of society I don't
understand why they're inappropriate
forces
Oh I mean look here's the thing in a in
a perfect world they would not be
inappropriate but again some people find
those words to be offensive and those
words are
extra doesn't you know those people need
to fuck off there you go that's all you
need so they don't necessarily so
children don't necessarily lack the
ability to disseminate the appropriate
use of those words and like I said once
they hear their first one there once
they start repeating their first swear
word then it's all over then it's gonna
be custcity in this house as far as I'm
concerned it's gonna be nothing but
cussing because then it's like you don't
do this outside of the house but inside
of the house fuck shit yeah you do it
all you want
oh you found a great I'm not really
going to do some just the whole thing
seems so well no and it's not about like
I see a lot of people in Chad making a
hypothetical arguments but like the
people who are offended automatically
win and it's not like it's not about
them like automatically winning it's
about us being respectful to other
people because that's what that's what
it's all about is like why does it you
know check not everybody deserves
respect I'm gonna say that it's true and
while that's true you can't you can't
automatically know if someone deserves
respects if they're just overhearing
something that you're talking about like
you know if there is someone who's just
walking down the street and you're
saying ah fuck shit all the ass shit
yeah how do you know if that person
deserves respect
I don't ask nothing to do what the words
they're saying oh oh no I'm saying
you're saying the words okay and and
that person what if that person does
deserve respect and and they don't like
hearing those words and yet you're I
don't see what this has to do with
vocabulary newer you were asking what if
the people who were respecting don't
deserve respect
yeah and I'm saying how do you know they
deserve respect or not I say fuck the
people I know and respect all the time
it doesn't mean I disrespect them just
because I swear around them yeah but
those people probably are okay with
swear uh-huh
are there people in my life who you
don't swear on there's there's people in
my life who I do choose to respect them
but I think they're nuts sure sure but
you choose to respect their wishes about
your language cuz cuz there wouldn't be
any way to keep family peace otherwise
my sisters are Mormon
I would avoid well no actually you know
what I would happen to swear around here
I wouldn't do it excessively sure I'm
sure I'd do it without thinking about it
but she is a Mormon and I'm sure she
gets offended you know I probably I
don't even really think about it I guess
maybe I do swear around here and I just
don't care or notice because no sane
person person should give a shit I'll be
sure you know like I said and and this
is just me this is you know what what am
I going to be the change you want to see
you know people will be less uptight
about swearing so I'm gonna swear around
people don't change I want to see but
you know I'm gonna keep doing what I'm
doing like for example this is I'm gonna
lay out a hypothetical for you about
like you're Mormon sister right yeah you
probably don't care for her talking
about religion around yeah well I just
really you know what she doesn't talk
about religion right and do you think
that's because she respects your your
right not to hear about it because she
knows you don't necessarily want to I
don't even know if how much she knows
about my religious views it's just not
something I talk about around well this
is all I hear is my hypothetical my
hypothetical is what let's say she did
right let's say she brought in religion
all the time and that's not necessarily
annoyed and I wouldn't hang oh there's
so much sure but you would probably want
her not to talk about that so you could
hang out
if she wanted to talk about it I don't
think I could stop her I'm in a weird
situation here with you where I'm trying
to explain common decency saying fuck
you I don't common decency involves you
know how the word fuck is indecent word
is the word fuck is in DC it's an
audible exclamation point there there
fuck is an indecent word why because why
it literally means an indecent act so
this is there anything is there anything
inherently wrong with good sex sex is
something you do with someone you want
right right sex is the reason that we
all exist yes it is a social Normandy
not to be discussed okay well obviously
when I say fuck you I am not actually
understand I'm not actually asking you
to have intercourse with that person
you're not no maybe I've been designed
that words have different definitions
and one of the definitions of fuck is to
have intercourse yeah and the other
definition is just you know fuck off
fuck you I don't give a fuck it
basically exclamation point verbal
explanation play so I don't I don't see
how the sex definition has anything to
do with it because obviously I'm not
using it that way well then all I'm
saying is that's like that is a use of
the word
is it you were asking for how often does
the f-word get used as being sex to have
sex I wouldn't only imagine quite a lot
I would often not nearly as much as it
is just an exclamation something you say
when you're angry or something when you
get excited like holy fuck I know Mom we
we have we have very different lives
when when when when the Blackhawks score
a goal and I say oh fuck that that
doesn't mean I want to have sex with
Patrick Kane do you understand this
maybe it maybe then the the real problem
is your your vocabulary
you're taking this word how the context
so words shouldn't have more than one
meaning well you know if they do and by
the way maybe the Blackhawks are really
confused too because they're like this
guy is totally Indian man
oh no one heard the chat saying I was
soft today before I had kids like I'm
I'm not a prude maybe I'm a prude I
don't know I mean you guys have seen the
things I do and say I enjoy cussing and
I enjoy crude things but I think there
is an understanding that children lacked
as far as the crude things are concerned
and I think like when when kids are like
exposed to these crude things in the
wrong way that's when we get the s all
11 year-olds calling everyone faggots on
Xbox Live is because they don't
understand the meanings of words or the
meanings of expressions I don't think I
don't think fuck is equivalent to the
word faggot no no that was a it's not a
slur against any race creed not even a
religions that insult to a lifestyle
it's just it's fuck oh sure but I think
that's part of like a greater expletive
well maybe we should put more thought
into what are and are not swear words I
don't know I don't know that fuck
belongs them I don't know that shit
belongs there
god damn it certainly doesn't belong
there I mean like I said it's it's it's
all part of it it's all part of a
greater scheme of kids not understanding
the weight of words and you know the the
we can agree and disagree about be like
obscenity that's not a word it's obscene
edea word up said well the obscenity
myths like the the level of obscenity of
the word fuck right but it's like a
child doesn't understand the weight of
these words and so by the way yet I
don't have any problem with slurring of
religion I don't I just brought that up
we're talking about what these words
mean context rules
look doesn't have it's not in any insult
to anybody right oh right
a word that and for some reason people
are offended by it and I don't entirely
understand why do I think my kids will
be better better than what galaxy looks
better than me hopefully ones already
smarter than me and he's only seven so
I'm just that's all you can hope for you
know all I'm all I'm trying to impart on
my children and the people around me is
that I want them to understand that the
things they say have meaning I guess I
guess that's the the the philosophical
underlying statement the Rising Sun is
saying rich doesn't understand the
weight of the words either apparently I
don't understand why the words have
weight in the first place yes that's how
we express our feelings and emotion and
thoughts and ideas committee decided
that the word fuck was offensive they
everything were the world and by the way
to becoming less and less self you know
like what was it you know who swears are
becoming more and more abundant on cable
television we we as a society determine
what words are and are not offense
but
so and you know it's just it's just one
of those things and that by the way it's
perfectly okay that rich and I have
these disagreements on this yeah she's
fine is this is just a backup who are
you baby I don't know I haven't been
able to pay attention to cutscenes cuz
we're doing this during stream I it
looks like you're fighting like a
pot-bellied the SNM yes and I'd love it
I think it's great I think it's
hilarious the GIMP that's what he is
he's a gambler so anyway I mean it's to
wrap up it's it's okay if you guys agree
or disagree with rich or I or if you
disapprove both of us or agree with both
of us we all have these different items
by the way looks like there's some kind
of shit storm happening in the chat I
don't know what happened
yeah what's going on jacket
I don't think like I don't think that
cursing will directly lead to
problematic behavior
the dude 1941 says Decca sounds like
you're more concerned that allowing your
children to curse freely will lead to
problematic behavior and I don't think
that I don't think there is a causation
I think that it's there are people who
allow their children to curse and
they're fine merrily people have a lot
of their children are curse and they're
not fine and my children once they learn
how to curse will be allowed to curse I
mean I love it I love cursing I think
it's great but you know just teaching
them when it's appropriate you know when
you're around people you know who also
occurs and go nuts make it a curse storm
all right I killed the S mmm oh I ripped
out his nipple chains that's exciting
you know like I'm I think that I think
there's a difference
oh my god I'm watching that cutscene now
ripping out his nipple or hey you know
like Pollak politically correct is one
of those words that is thrown around not
a lot now as a negative it is a negative
and I think well but but I think it's
often like being politically correct is
often confused with being polite and I
think there is a very real difference
between just being polite and that's all
I'm trying to teach that up all I'm
trying to teach them is think about the
people around me and by thinking about
the people around you hopefully it will
encourage them to think about you and
think about the people around them and
if we were all thinking about the people
around us wouldn't that be a great thing
if we were all like concerned with the
people around us I think that would be a
nice nice thing I just I just don't
understand why people are offended by
words like shit in the first place I
don't think you have to understand I
think you just have to acknowledge
yeah exactly crocodile brain it says
Jack the man who plays fuck bought five
thousand he's droppin some knowledge on
swearing that's the thing like fuck by
five thousand is one of my favorite
creations and I loved the idea of a
robot that unstoppably has sex with
everything it comes across and that's
yeah that's okay
yet if I'm hanging around with people
whom I know don't like swearing I will
refrain from swearing because I'm being
polite
this game has some problems managing
screening the scrolling I notice
anything about that it's fine that's
fine great
oh thanks the dude the the dude is is
finding a way to agree with both of us
rich oh really yeah
what do you say the duty of the dude
1944 says he agrees with rich that
swearing shouldn't be that big of a deal
yeah but I agree with Jack that being
considerate of others is a positive
thing you know what I like in
generalizations that's great isn't that
great
unstoppable fuck robot sounds like a
good description of rich Evans after the
Star Wars video and I like that you know
what I don't like that good things are
good and bad things
well they sometimes can be bad that's a
generalization right I kind of like
shake it's a bit of a masher but it's
fun
like everything clay does it looks great
I love the animation mm-hmm agreed
agreed it looks great
all right who was it that that made the
text adventure stick Lords or something
he has not sent me an email with his
contact information yet I haven't played
it yet but I have also not received an
email from him like his contact
information as I requested how will I
get ahold of you stick Lords asking us
to write him something I have no idea
how to write a adventure game so that's
something I have any experience with we
can we can figure it out that well
that's why I want to get in contact with
him to like figure out what he needs
like do you need all the branches do you
need just some like story structure
listen we won't make it happen but we
need a way to get ahold of you right
oh god damn it why are you falling off
that cliff
yes I have the link for it but oh uh
Jack today earlier today yeah um was
subscriber huh
one year one year one year actually oh
my god John kilo has more John kilo well
first first omni remix no 12 months in a
row well we've been doing this for a
year right John kilo hmm 13 months jesus
H Christ Jesus fuck jesus titty-fucking
Christ fuckin hell Wow Wow Jesus not
anal penetration but fuckin ass cheek
Christ thirty thirteen months yep I'm
thinking about it
Lord Beaumont Zeno's been all on buck
who's rich read Stardust Godfather 42
Craig Adele brain and tired and sad
thank you for subscribing we really
appreciate it
it's true yeah I mean I can't believe
we've been doing this for 13 months and
we still can't figure out audio and we
still can't hear a depressing thing
isn't that great yeah yeah I mean we
we've come a long way since those early
streams you hear you listen to those
early streams it's a different beast is
is there an official prereq birthdate I
don't I'd have to look back
I have to look back on when our first
like group stream was I don't know if
there was an official I mean there is an
official obviously but I don't know what
it is oh ow
big man hurt oh okay big man hurt face
maybe we can rehash the capture card
saga of the first season right we had
we've had we had very different problems
that for the first couple of months
did I give you the key to Frozen Synapse
rich did I send you did I told you the
key to plays and say yes I'm gonna say
yes yeah I think I forwarded that to the
the Zayas were thanking people for
subscribing to this dream
John kilo said he subbed on the first
day we were at which part oh my god
so that is we've been going for 13 my
living gone for slightly longer than 13
months because we were screaming a
little bit before we were partners oh my
god we should if we should do an
anniversary XCOM stream where we pick up
XCOM where i love to help I'm all down
with that I don't have to beg me to play
X come save it up great save it up twos
coming out I don't know when oh nothing
I dunno I just want to know more about
it yeah
Frozen Synapse has an iPad version
there's crazy
now thirteen months that's on this one
year in one month I know yeah I've made
it a little farther in Batman Arkham I I
don't know if I'll finish Batman Arkham
before Arkham Knight comes out Arkham
Asylum but cities that would place city
so you get to experience the open-world
okay because if you play arkham knight
after asylum you're gonna think the
open-world some kind of great change
when they had an open world in two well
that my the the thought process that i
was going through was do i do i a you
know try to catch up with the series get
a little more of Arkham Asylum get a
little obsidian before Arkham Knight so
I can be as up-to-date with it or
knowing that you are all up to date with
it come in with a fresh pair of eyes
maybe and then I can just be like
imagine in I'm just this this person who
knows nothing about the the Arkham games
and and this is my thought on Arkham
Knight which could be better which could
make for better back-and-forth
and I won't have time to place it it
fits
you know how all right shake just got a
lot harder oh great
I don't know what this means to tribes
but I love it some cities run on steel
mills others run on hookers who are you
to judge I just like the idea of a city
run on the hookers Vegas Vegas babe not
Vegas you can't you can't have hookers
in Vegas you have to go to like a city
outside of Vegas really yeah why is that
because it's not legal in the city
limits of Las Vegas you have to go up to
why what do you mean why would they
bother making it illegal in Vegas the
whole purpose of the city is to be
filled with debauchery yeah right well
that's that's just politics but it's
legal just outside of Vegas and so they
they have the people who advertise for
it in Vegas like have customs you know
like we will take you don't worry we
will get you to the hookers well Buster
there you do it to do and busts you back
it's all in one piece
it's not inside Las Vegas because Las
Vegas is a real city okay blackjack
debauchery all you can do in actual Las
Vegas is get blackout drunk lose your
life savings and go see titty shows oh
yeah did did you just uh an TV show yeah
it was appropriate nice nice
nds Marco Marco says the bus trips back
would be the saddest thing ever or or
just everybody's really happy you know
like a group of guys just had sex are
now heading back to whatever they left
in Vegas and I'm just like man I feel
pretty good about that I felt like that
was a good transaction I felt like the
amount of money I spent on those ladies
to do weird things with me it was worth
it
ah capitalism
I think I'm gonna get to the next boss
and then we're gonna call it a night
okay I think that's fine yeah I'm
shocked we've made it this long to tell
you the truth so my we had a rough night
was that a smooth night
no we had a rough start
maybe we can we can do some tests on
Wednesday before we start yeah we can
simulate somebody calling in here yeah
I'll be there but I like a no good on I
can go to the other room and in the
calling I'm a laptop and whatnot oh fuck
fuck
no way apparently I'm wrong about
prostitution the city of Las Vegas does
not ban prostitution the state of Nevada
has banned it in all it has banned it in
all of Clark County what are you talking
about
holy shit this game just got intense
Oh father why are you talking about gogo
incense I'm trying to go back in the
chat Oh bother
I'm not I'm not with you here there's a
Google Doc who's a Google Doc was a
Google Doc hold on hold on this is this
is Richard simulation of what he would
sound like with a prostitute
free Freddie very funny very funny pick
up that gun I'm not good for any of your
shenanigans don't I take enough shit on
best lowers yes yes
did you win no try again you're fit
looks like you're fighting all the boss
I am is that what that none of my bosses
but I'm fighting a ridiculous amount of
people gotcha
I'm with you it's not like we all pick
on right we all pick on each other but
everyone picks on everyone else but rich
doesn't edit the episodes and so usually
the rule is whoever's editing makes
everyone else look bad and rich never
edits the episodes and so and so it's
it's just he's left with with what what
he's left with if rich ever edits an
Amazon nano man everyone else is gonna
look like ass
but that's just how it works sometimes
yeah we are gonna do an e3 not like a
reaction video we're going to my hope is
to make it more like the viewing
segments of best of the worst we're rich
and I will watch the e3 videos together
and hopefully crack some jokes during
the presentation and that will be the
bulk of the video so not like a reaction
video just like a straight-up
us blank face but and then talk about it
for a little bit it won't be like really
last year's e3 video was a lot of
talking and not a lot of reaction this
one will be a little more reaction and a
little talking because I want it to be a
little shorter than last one so that's
what's going to happen I just cut
somebody's arm off I don't know why I
have no idea why I did that
no I think that's great
yeah it's great I don't think that stage
had a boss fight anything could just
head up insane amount of insane guys for
sure sure Wow ok well then thank you
everyone for coming out and wading
through our shit-filled sea of technical
issues we will constantly work on fixing
them and most likely never fix them
passions unless this is a boss fight
maybe it's the grand finale of the game
I don't know see that was kind of the
middle of playing goodbye Oh keep you
all we can do a goodbye a little bit
early it's probably still gonna be
goodbye ok
ok very quickly
I'm saying if this is the boss fight I'm
gonna do it sure I should careful you
cuz this looks like it might be the end
of the game I'm not sure really close
like a cheapy download game well now
he's running away this is a stage
alright now we're done okay
well then thank you to all the new
subscribers thank you to all the old
subscribers and thanks to everyone else
or just watch just wade through
technical issues and play a little bit
of Schenck we really do appreciate it
well there's no more funny egg funnier I
can edit than when I almost ended the
stream earlier so okay okay we caught up
on me yeah we're caught up on the thanks
alright yeah we're good alright can't
find the button to turn it off is you
should turn it off then I have no jokes
oh okay
well I'll just try me just turn off
without any jokes all right off
