the other side how is it being on the
other side and having to type at me and
then wait like 10 seconds for me to talk

email whatever email you used to sign up
twitch check your email and see if they
have a little thing that says you're a
moderator now
this is our historic first mission it's
a super time for us we should probably
do a train a few training exercises I
know I'm boring
oh my god so much text welcome to the
space bus tutorial Iser I decided it
myself
neato alright let's tackle the basics
first before we get into the time travel
mind fudge REE oh okay

jump done oh man I'm so good at this
game
X fires yeah the Satori Eliezer is
simulating a blunt bot enemy scratch
that a cheat trigger finger buddy
great
now it's time to test your specially
charged attack on these missile turrets
nice nice that's what that's what
happens when you hold down the fire
button great nailing it
time-travel all right
alright that's super fun wait we can
shoot through walls nice

shoot up and the dag alright
sup she'll be all ready to get this
whole learn stuff thing out of the way
charge attack that totally bounce this
fake nice shield night
what
what what happened
okay well rich if you're in the mod list
in your mind maybe your sword this isn't
showing up God how do I do this what did
he tell me to do again I forgot
I have no idea what I was supposed to do
here
I should have been paying attention
I'm just gonna die over and over here
rich do you wanna stream Mass Effect 3
how do I do this
what the actual fudge I suppose it here
if anyone knows yeah I have been
pressing and charging and holding my
shield and then that happens
I am holding the button down you jerks
he only blocks me from one side Jesus
Christ that's what I'm supposed to view
that's that stuff oh not just to hold it
down hold it down and let it go would
have blocked from both sides see that's
what I was supposed to do I did it wrong
I didn't learn I didn't learn good
enough
all right time thrusters we can learn
all about super timing and forcing
Eddie's soldiers prepare to have your
mind blown what
what if I said I don't know what I'm
supposed to be doing oh here we go
I did it
I think Oh dudes are they're using a
timeout and a team up in other words
you're saying you see man okay it's okay
I see if we can figure out this time
forest mechanic
I was running against the clock we ran
out of time and proved to evaporate into
thin air piss beats it's time out as
many hoes you need to blast down as well
what am i doing
I have no idea what's happening
I don't know if I quite understand this
game yet hey hey rich got his sword
congratulations rich I don't know how to
play the game yet
okay I think I won
oh hey don't spoil invisible ink review
yet and we wants a timeout and tag in a
new team member to add more firepower
could have to get past tough areas like
this one
this is how I was supposed to be doing
like just adding I needs he made it in
whatever oh my god I feel like I'm
really bad at this
okay
you want the actual fuck
I don't know how I feel about this game
so far guys this is taking all of my
concentration
okay you've got 60 seconds to make it
across the battlefield and you've got 30
timeouts when you run out of those well
it's game over
this is not good I'm doing so far why
oh my god
I grabbed a carb
I need more alarms okay
jesus H Christ
there's a lot of thinking for a game
called super time force without there
I'm incredibly beaten by I apologize for
everyone for for my lack of speaking
because it's just there's just so much
there's so much going on and I'm so
terribly confused about everything
about everything and everyone mostly
everything okay oh my god
I don't need this put that out there
right now I don't like this I don't like
the feel this
yeah play checkers I agree like I
actually really kind of dislike this I
was hoping for I was someone for a fun
time shoot him up with with a little
like time mechanic twist and what I'm
getting is too much
hurts my brain
you're gonna press this button
downtime
okay
oh we gotta head
all right so then we gotta go back we
gotta take down the door before the
robot I get it

one that's fine that's fine and I'm
gonna put them right here

just flip ring yet
I can't gets dead right away alright
guys I'm done I'm done I do not like
this game I am not having a good time
playing this game in a stream and I then
maybe maybe under different
circumstances that would be a super fun
game I found it really confusing and not
intuitive at all to play it so I guess
it's time for checkers

[Part II]
the crowd wants FTL this late you guys

cares there's so many naked women online
does it matter if it's Jennifer Lawrence
there's naked women doing all sorts of
terrible things for your enjoyment let
just let Jennifer Lawrence act
who cares if she's naked this is all I'm
saying
go go watch some high-class pornography
and enjoy the ladies doing despicable
things for your pleasure
just let Jennifer Lawrence be in her
movies okay she was in the hungry games
dick the birthday haha let that's what
I'm saying let her be hungry in the
games that's right John Kayla who cares
if you're naked too just go be naked to
the world if that's your thing
thank you triple o King for dancing for
me
I'm not saying sex is despicable I'm
saying there are people who do it far
better and more often than Jennifer
Lawrence
they're called pornography stars
biscuits running up and down the stairs
it's kind of weird
am i super close to beating shovelknight
I can't be super super close
oh my god them two levels away no I'll
say this I'll say this
I will save this jacket for sex weird uh
yeah probably flops in Technicolor I'm
glad that you're naked right now
enjoy your nakedness enjoy it
yeah I did I don't know if I have it in
me for these last two levels I'll save
these last two levels I'm you know I'm
sure Jennifer Lawrence is nice to look
at but you know
that's fine just nipple artists Arabo
event I'm not I mean she might be
actually looks a little lean I like
she'd be awkward oh pardon one day short
yeah okay I'm gonna save these last two
for the final run and then I will have
the entirety of Sheldon line on the
stream I'm late it's late and I have an
episode of pre-marked at it tomorrow so
that is gonna be it ask questions while
we're still here
rich isn't a Jan I'm gonna Chad I'm
gonna talk at you rich is here to answer
your questions in chat form
and ask away before
we go away which is gonna happen soon
yes let us stop the strange talk of
things
not that into her doesn't matter
how does this game compared to Zelda it
was a very different game than Zelda
dick the birthday boy Dragon's crown is
free for Vita on PS Plus you should get
it no I got it and I was really bored
with it Oh Dragon's crown is free for
PlayStation Plus members so I downloaded
it and played it and within the first 15
minutes you get what the entire game is
gonna be about I was incredibly bored
with Dragon's crown which is a shame
because it has a super fantastic art
style and nothing else the combat system
is incredibly repetitive the battles are
tedious the art style is great but I
found the game to be such a horrible
bore I am sorry dick the birthday boy if
you enjoy it that's great dunces kind i
I was so bored with it I got I want to
say I got five hours into the game and I
couldn't I couldn't bear to turn it on
it's just I was so bored with it yeah
take the birthday boy because I don't
like dragons crown
it's unsubscribed from the twitch scream
and canceling his patron well that's
fine
I do like dynasty whores you know what
because dynasty warriors at least the
combat felt satisfying and in Dragon's
crown I don't know it's just all I know
it seems weird to say that it's so
repetitive as compared with dynasty war
but it just wants
not
my romário I agree let's get rich into
Canada so you can see a real doctor
I haven't played any of the modern
Ghostbuster games
Oh Richard you liked it okay that's good
yeah it's you know
that's the thing Dragon's crown is
golden axe on steroids it's golden axe
with a really great art style but golden
axe wasn't it wasn't that creative game
it was very repetitive and you know back
in the day it's all it's all we had
and
oh I want to go to Tim Hortons let's get
up to Canada soon so if you go to Tim
Hortons that's a great place get some
poutine
when are you gonna play board games on
camera soon we are going to play board
games on camera one of these not soon
one of these days I figured out how to
at least get oh no we did we figured it
out the other day Jay has an HDMI
switcher so we could hook out multiple
cameras and use the HDMI switcher to
feed the cameras into my capture device
which would then feed into the stream so
it is very doable they don't have it one
of these days it will happen one of
these is me to rich I we get we get
tweets all the times over at the prereq
twitter is saying that people bought FTL
or bought XCOM because of our live
streams that are loving it and I ate and
high-enriched super appreciate that rich
and I super appreciate that these are
great games I could play if it were up
to me I would play nothing but FTL and
Super Meat Boy every single stream just
because those are games that I love
obviously and I try to bear it up for
you guys but get FTL X come Brits really
enjoys it I'm sure I'll get into one of
these is
the Star Trek VCR game yes absolutely
will happen good for you Lucas farts I'm
glad that FTL is now in your top 5 FTL
FTL has given me some of the most
intense moments in recent gaming memory
and that's and we're talking about a
game that you readily pause and it's
essentially a turn-based combat game I
get so worked up when I play FTL I love
it I love it I love it alright but
that's gonna be it for me again thank
you guys for coming out I think I'm
gonna give super time force another
chance when I haven't been drinking but
thanks for coming out rich is good
trivia chat for a little bit and yes I
need to finish my Ironman run of ex-cop
but Allah

[Part III]
We wish them the best. 
Happy Canada Day?
Cool, Canada, too. Yay holidays.
What? 
Are you, Mr. Primal asks, am I amazed by Jay and Mike's talent?
The Samurai Cop interview was great.
I'm, I mean, constantly in awe of Jay.
I think they, I think they did a really great job. 
Um, I, you know, I, I've actually, I've only seen Samurai Cop, the movie, once. 
I was not involved with the original find of the Samurai Cop movie, and so I was really glad, um, not to be involved in that one.
I was, you know, behind the cameras, making sure everyone sounded and looked okay. 
Um, but I, I think they did a great job.
It's, it's, the, I want to say they talked to him...
We were shooting, I want to say for two-and-a-half, maybe three hours, uh, and so I think they did a great job cutting it all together.
No, it's not Canada Day?
What?
Oh, it's Labor Day.
Yeah, tomorrow is Labor Day, so pour one out to all the laborers.
As you already know, as I've been chatting, today, uh, I'm pouring out a, uh, a Lakefront Brewery Extended Play
A really great, smooth IPA.
And, normally -- or, ISA is what they call it -- and I normally don't like IPA's. 
Of course, I only drink IPA's because they're a higher alcohol content.
I, and John Kilo, I do not know when the second part of the interview will be released.
I'm, I'm pretty sure that they just released it in two parts just so they could get something out quicker.
CandySmack, you're drinking Stiegl and gin.
You lucky son of a bitch.
I ran out.
Jay drank my last one.
And I'm okay with that, because he's my friend.
So, I don't know when the second one will be released.
Hopefully, I can only imagine this week.
I mean, you know, it's...interviews are pretty easy.
All right, you know what?
We're gonna get to the game here.
We have a super fun game to play.
I think.
If we can get it going.
There it is.
We are gonna play Tiny Barbarian.
I have been looking forward to playing this since well before its release.
Um, in fact, I forgot about -- one of the the joys of early access is, I forgot that this game was getting released until it recently went on a Humble Bundle sale.
So I am super excited play this.
Ooh.
Boop bloop.
Okay.
Press attack to begin.
We are gonna play some Tiny Barbarian.
That's me.
Do you see me?
I'm a tiny barbarian.
This is my first time playing the game.
I don't know what's going on.
I was really thinking there would be music.
Why is there no music?
What's going on?
What is happening here?
What is happening here?
Is this the whole game?
No, this isn't the whole game.
Is it, like, an endless fighter?
What do you guys know about Tiny Barbarian?
Apparently, I know nothing.
Oh, okay.
I get it.
It's like a scripted, it's like a scripted thing.
I'm with ya.
No Mario Kart tonight.
I have, I have been receiving some of your Nintendo friend requests, and I will do -- not next week, I'll, I'll be out of town next week, so we won't get a solo stream next week -- um, but maybe, maybe the week after, I will do a, a in-stream Mario Kart tournament.
How's the sound for everybody?
Play some checkers.
I'm not gonna be playing checkers.
I apologize.
You know what?
I'm not gonna play checkers because I'm not as good as Rich.
Rich is too good at checkers.
Oh, my god.
The Serpent Lord.
Okay.
Here we go, guys.
Sound is good.
Volume...
Thank you, Octo-Jay.
I didn't see you, Octo-Jay.
Our lovely mod is here to moderate y'all.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, my god.
This is adorable.
Look at this.
So, it's just jump and attack.
Also, if you press down and the attack button, you flex your muscles.
Shoulder buttons don't do anything.
So this is straight up NES.
I keep looking for, like, secret stuff.
Oh.
Oh, that's neat.
Do I have to press anything?
You have to press up.
Okay, you can press up.
That looks like a secret thing, right?
No?
Okay.
Spikes.
Usually, if someone comes and asks if there are spikes in this game...and the answer is, of course, yes, there are spikes in this game.
That looks like I should be able to...
Oh.
Oh, well.
Doesn't matter.
I keep expecting one of these walls to break away if I slash it with my sword.
That's usually a secret thing.
Hmm.
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
Oh, my first enemy.
It's a little snake.
Look at how adorable that is.
Look at how adorable, and deadly.
Great.
This is fantastic.
Um...
Get out of here, you bird.
I don't know, like, what else, like, I can...
I can't tell you too much about, about the Matt Hannon interview, because the second part will be coming up.
Just bear in mind, the second half is equally as good.
I, I remember him talking more in depth about, about the style of guerilla filmmaking that they were doing,.
You know, for example, he was talking about just showing up one day and a guy lit himself on fire, and there was no fire truck.
There was no ambulance.
And apparently that's how, that's how they made the movies, is just run and gun shooting.
The director didn't have permits for anything.
Fucking bird.
Come here, I'll...
Wait for him to come to you.
That's the name of the game.
Get out of here, ya bird.
Uh, didn't have permits for anything, but was, uh, exceptionally good at, at bullshitting his way into...
Any game that has a flex button.
Look at that.
Um, was really good at bullshitting his way into locations, and what they would do a lot on Samurai Cop, and I hope I'm not spoiling anything from the next interview, is the director would figure out what big-budget movie was shooting nearby, and just say that they were second unit.
And so it's, like, if, you know, for example, if Tango and Cash were shooting down the street, they'd be like, "Yeah, we're the second unit for Tango and Cash." 
And if anyone hassled them, they'd immediately go, "Oh yeah, no problem. We have permits all over the place today."
Oh, I jumped right into that.
Can you believe that?
I mean, you can, you saw it, hopefully.
So...
Uh...
So that was really fun to hear about, about stuff like that, that kind of, that kind of guerilla filmmaking.
Oh.
Oh, hidden chicken.
It finally happened.
Hidden chicken.
Now I just want more hidden chicken.
No.
Um, that kind of guerrilla style of filmmaking is super fun, especially for, for someone who has done a lot of that.
And in Milwaukee, we don't need to worry about that at all, because in Milwaukee you can film out in public without a permit.
But, still really fun to hear about.
He just had some good...
Oh.
He just had some good stories.
Definitely wanna get up there if I can.
Nope.
Nope.
I do that.
I did it before.
We're gonna be playing Jack-falls-off-of-vines.
Welcome to this episode of Jack Falls Off of Vines, sponsored by Vine.
Simple way to share videos online.
Be social.
Share videos.
Vine.
Oh, fuck.
Come on.
I can do this.
I don't even, I don't even know what's up there or if it's anything good, but I...
Okay, all right.
Just getting the hang of this, guys.
Oh.
Nope.
Nope.
Come, come the fuck on.
Sorry, this requires all of my concentration.
Fuck.
Oh, my god.
There's something up there.
We must have that thing.
Oh, how do you do that?
That's impossible.
Sure, it's not impossible.
Oh.
Oh, I think I've just, I've been pressing down this whole time.
Ugh.
This is tense.
This is intensity, in ten cities.
Oh, fuck you.
I'm gonna do this, guys.
This is the whole stream.
This is the entire night, right here.
Just getting this one vine challenge.
Brought to you by Vine.
Six second video clips.
Six second pieces of life.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
I'm doing what?
Uh, ElvisDelvis asks, "When I do these solo streams, do I do them from the studio or at home?"
Uh, you know, like, whichever is funnier in your head.
If you, if you would like to think that I'm alone, on the Plinkett house set, crying, when I'm not streaming...
If that's...
Fuck.
Fuck you.
If that's funnier to you, or, I've said it, I mean, I've said it before, it's just, I'm, I'm at home.
I'm at home.
Fuck.
Mostly because then I don't need to drag my computer and everything to the studio.
Nope, no no no.
You have to be lower on that vine.
Nope.
Nope.
Jumping the gun.
Jumping the vine gun.
Nope.
I'm gonna give up in a little bit, because I feel bad for you guys watching.
But, normally, whilst video gaming, this is...
Oh, here we go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Fuck.
Normally this is something that would eat my br-...
Oh, I don't even know what happened that time.
I cannot explain to you what happened that time.
Can I plug in my NES controller?
Hold on, guys.
Quick change of p-, uh, plan.
Pause.
Pause for NES controller.
You just heard some things fall off a shelf.
I have...
Whipboned asks if I've tried pine resin.
I have not.
I have not tried pine resin.
But thank you, you big jerk.
Okay.
Hold on.
Plugging in my NES controller to see if that works.
I would love it if my NES controller would work.
Come on.
Input device keyboard?
I've been on the keyboard.
Oop, there it goes.
There's the boop boop.
Come on.
I heard the boop boop.
I heard the bloop loop.
As I said, I feel like I need my NES controller.
Give it a work.
We're gonna see if it works.
For some reason, my, my Xbox is not, my Xbox controller is not giving me the responsiveness I need.
You're absolutely right, I need that second flak cannon.
Double flaks all the way.
Come on.
All right.
Hold on a second, guys.
Hold on one hot second.
That's what we're doing.
This is what we're doing.
We're gonna make sure that we're all plugged in here.
Just wait, y'all.
Yeah.
Are you working, or not?
You son of a bitch, you work.
You work, you, you controller.
Installing device driver software.
Go.
Click here for status.
Ready to use.
All right.
Here we go.
Aww, it's not gonna work.
Son of a honkey.
Why is it not working?
Oh.
We tried.
This was a game, much like Shovel Knight, that was designed for the NES gamepad.
Yet, here I am, not able to use my USB NES gamepad.
Okay.
You can just, guy, you guys just get to hear all of the lovely bloop bloops.
Ow.
Everything's fine.
Don't worry
Everything's fine.
All right.
Toggle full-screen.
Here we go.
Coming back.
Resume.
Okay.
I'm not giving up.
Never, never give up.
Never surrender.
Today's vine challenge, sponsored by Vine.
It's tragic.
If you jump too soon...
Fuck you.
Like, right here.
Nope.
Okay.
Yes!
Was it worth it?
I don't know.
Get out of here.
Chicken!
Yes.
Always chicken.
Oh.
Okay, you can't touch the sides of the spikes.
Putting that out there.
Oh.
I don't know if you guys can see that.
That's one of my moves is, like, the shoulder drop.
Awesomeness.
Noo...
Shoulder-dropped into some spikes.
That's okay.
Eagle.
We have an eagle, guys.
There's an eagle in this game.
I got the first Chaos Emerald.
Ooh.
Hey now.
Okay, here we go.
Killing snakes.
Killing snakes, barbarian style.
This music is great.
Classic.
I feel like there's a secret down here, right?
No.
Just a place for me to die.
And kill a bird.
It's a question of just where's this seeker gonna be.
Fucking bird.
Get out of here, ya bird.
Yes.
Oh, that was neat.
How did I do that?
Oh, okay.
You can just kind of jump.
Secrets.
Oh, you got me, you bastard.
Get out of here.
Chicken?
Oh, yes.
A crystal.
Nice.
Why do assholes call it a Chaos Emerald?
Yeah, I get the joke.
I get the joke.
Victoria20, I'm gonna play this tonight.
I also have, um, I have Super Time Force, which I'm super excited to play.
2D action platformers, that's where we're going, y'all.
We've been together.
Seeing if I can take out that fucking bird.
Did I get that chicken?
Do I get chicken from birds?
Get out of here.
If it's there...
There's got to be something there, right?
There's gotta be a...
Nope.
Apparently, by the way, the answer is no.
I thought a secret...
Oh, fuck.
Oh, no.
I did not realize how bad I was doing.
Oh, good. 
Chicken chicken chicken.
Chicken chicken chicken.
Okay, here we go.
A tiny barbarian, facing a...a what?
Oh, come here.
Gimme shit.
As I beat up this little guy, he gives me things.
Come here.
No.
Give me the chicken.
Gimme that chicken.
Ohh...
Okay, we got all the chicken we could from the little guy.
Love that.
Oh.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Getting snakes, yo.
Getting the snakes, yo. 
This is so enjoyable.
I don't know how we live in a world in which these wonderfully made NES throwbacks happened.
I mean, I know how they happened.
Chock-full of nostalgia, but...
I think, I feel like something like this, or something like Shovel Knight could have turned out really poorly.
I mean, I can't use my NES USB controller.
I can't use my BSUSB.
But...
Fuck you.
Oh, come on.
Come on, tiny barbarian.
Be slightly less tiny.
That helps.
I don't know if you knew that.
It helps.
Oof.
What are you saying there, Jack.
Recommend some horror films.
That's not my department.
That is, uh, that's Jay.
Jay's the horror film...
Awesome 8-bit muscles.
Uh, Jay's department is all horror.
You're right, BlockCastleHunkerDown.
Shovel Knight does not just stop anything of nostalgia.
It is its own game, and experience as is this.
I'm really enjoying this.
his is definitely more just nostalgia, whereas Shovel knight is, would have been a great game in any art style.
It just happens to be a great game in 8-bit art style.
Did you guys see That?
Did that move the top of the screen?
Oh.
Get out of here.
I killed men!
I'll hit you again, too.
Oh, there's gotta be something up there.
I have all these things.
There we go.
There we go.
That's the way, the way of all their video games.
Fuck.
Can you show me this new way?
Hey, get there, you dick.
You tiny barbarian dick.
I don't care about it that much, whatever is over there, which I'm sure is nothing.
Hiya!
Whoa.
That asshole just threw a spear at me.
Get out of here, asshole.
You dingus.
Get over here.
Get out of here.
Get over here.
Bird.
Fucking bird.
I gotta take care of this bird first.
Bird, bird, bird.
I don't know if you guys knew this, but the bird is the word.
Putting that out there.
Oh, I wanna do that.
Can I do that?
There's extra gold if I take those mines.
Oh, you dick.
Yes. 
Yes.
Oof.
I got started shoulder dropping more people.
Just cuz I can.
Get outta here, bird.
Fucking bird.
Is that an eagle?
Fuck you, symbol of freedom.
Oh, you can hit 'em.
Oh, no you can't hit 'em.
And I died.
Yay.
First death. 
And I don't know what it is guys, but I've run out of my snack much earlier than anticipated.
Hold on.
After we got another snack.
Pause.
Pause for a moment.
Snack run.
Okay, I'm back.
It's true.
One, John Kilo, one beer equsl Jack drunk.
It's true.
It's true.
And it is the holiday weekend.
Oh, do you can hear me pour?
Yes.
A perfect pour!
You know why it's perfect?
Because it's in a glass.
Okay.
Here we go.
Another beer.
What?
What is making that noise?
Oh, it's the game.
Oh, no.
Pausing it might have broken it.
Did pause it, did pausing it break it?
Oh, there we go.
Okay, pausing it did not break it.
We're okay.
All right.
Here we go.
Elbow drop.
That's how you got to deal with those guys.
Take 'em out.
Right to tweet.
And...sword.
Eagle fir...oh.
I wasn't facing the Eagle.
Come here, eagle.
Face me like a man, eagle.
Get out of here.
Haha!
You're dead.
And this guy I can probably elbow drop.
Yah!
I am the Barbarian.
Get outta here, get outta here.
I remember when I first heard about development of this game, and there, there were some early tests and some screenshots.
The only reason I followed, uh...
I wanna say this is made by Squall, Squall Games.
I followed them on Twitter just so I could keep up on development of Tiny Barbarian.
And I think I gave up rather quickly because it was gonna be a Windows-only game.
But now I can play it cuz that dual-boot. 
Elbow drop.
Oh, okay.
All right, we're coming for ya.
Or, we're not coming for you.
Never mind.
I'm going back around.
Damn.
Nope.
Oh, no.
Get out of here.
Dammit.
There.
Get out of here.
Barbarian!
Time and...
Gonna lose.
Gonna lose because I got that diamond.
Goddammit.
I feel great.
I feel great about this.
Oh, no, he's doing his cheeseburger voice?
Oh, I do that every once in a while.
I don't know if you guys have seen Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
Uh, but there's a moment when the computer says "Cheeseburger!"
I can only assume that's what you mean by cheeseburger voice.
Okay, I'm facing a cannon.
What?
What, I'm facing a cannon?
Get outta here.
Oh, my god.
That's kind of dumb.
I'd like to be able to hit more than once.
And, elbow drop!
Cheeseburger!
Oop, he's not dead.
Yeah.
Now you is.
Checkpoint, all right.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Someone is asking me if I drink warm beer.
What?
Warm beer?
Someone is saying, "Jack, can you have somebody solo stream instead, or two group streams because you won't be here next Sunday?"
Uh, I will talk to Rich about that, and see if he wants to try his very first solo stream.
Um, that's not a bad idea because I won't be here next Sunday.
We will, will definitely do a group stream on -- I can't climb up that -- we'll definitely do a group stream on Wednesday, like we normally do.
Fact about this?
How do I get up there?
Oh, fuck.
Um, mir, mirma, mima....MiMa just subscribed.
What?
MiMa, you've been here for a while, and you've just subscribed?
Welcome.
Welcome to the pizza rolls.
Welcome to the cheeseburger.
Look at this guy.
Get out of here.
Rich was born...
Rich was born for primetime.
You know. it's, Rich, I don't know if you guys have noticed, but Rich has a small problem talking and playing games at the same time.
Uh, to the point where it's a little silly.
Rich, Rich is a little silly about it.
His, his lack of ability to talk and play at the same time can, might, might, uh, hinder...
Oh, my god.
Might hinder the stream.
Jesus Christ.
Get outta here.
I, I mean, I know you guys know that, if it's a really intense moment, all you, all you'll hear out of me is a little um's and er's and...
Hey, get over here, you bandit.
Oh.
Oh, I let him...
You, you, you dickhole.
I needed some chicken out of that guy.
So it's not all, that's why I do, like, the group stream.
I think, particularly, last Wednesday when Rich was playing X-COM, and not saying a goddamn thing, but Jay and I were having really good conversations.
So I hope you guys liked that, too.
You know, a little game, game kind of as background, right?
And, and some just good conversations.
I felt really good about Wednesday's stream, conversation-wise.
Ooh, that's nice.
Look at that.
Did you see that level design?
They gave me something to go for down here so I knew that I could drop down.
I bet that'll play, I bet that'll come into play later on where I need to drop down.
Ooh.
Get outta here.
Ooh.
Not gonna get me, spearmaster.
Hahaha!
That's what your...
What is that?
You guys, I think I get to ride that thing.
I think I get to ride that thing.
I think I get to ride that thing.
I get the [indecipherable].
Oh, no.
Come back!
Come back, my friend!
I'm sorry.
Oh, my Yoshi.
Look at that.
You can double jump on him.
Get the fuck out of town.
I love this.
Okay.
You come, too.
We can make that jump together.
Together, my beastly friend.
Oh, I have to leave him.
But I love you, monster thing.
Oh.
I made that.
You guys saw that I made that, right?
Yes!
He's coming with me.
Come.
Come with me, super beast,
I need this chicken first, though.
Now, let's go!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Look at him!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Chicken.
Hold on, super beast.
There is chicken to be had, and I'm gonna get it.
Oh, no, I need you.
Hey.
Come.
Come, super beast.
We need chicken.
Yes.
You and me.
Chicken!
Okay.
Oh.
All right, we need this.
Every healing item in games is chicken to Jack.
That's true, MarioMario.
But first of all, I mean, they've all been chicken.
In the few games that we've played where there are healing items, there's, there's been chicken.
Oh.
I'm gonna get this.
I don't know what's up there, probably just...
Oh, maybe a diamond.
Come, my special friend.
Yes.
Ooh, a diamond.
Shining bright like a diamond.
Let's go.
Let us go, majestic bea--
Oh, fuck you.
You hit my majestic beast.
I won't kill you, my majestic, kind of ugly beast.
Hahaha!
I am king barbarian, and this is my noble speed, steed.
We will call him Turnip.
Hahaha.
Turnip, go!!
Um-num-num-num-num
Num-num-num-num-num-num!
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num!
I kind of love this.
Mmm.
Yes I just quoted Rhianna.
[indecipherable]
That's one I'd do.
You know why?
I like girly pop.
I can't help that.
Fuck you.
Are you okay, monster?
Good.
Monster, jump!
Num-num-num-num-num.
Wait.
Is there something over there?
A thing that I could...
No, no there wasn't.
Let's go!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Num-num-num-num!
Oh, I didn't forget about you guys.
Comin' after ya.
Num-num-num-num-num!
I will be back for you, my steed!
Fucking bird, like I don't, like I don't know what your deal is already, bird.
Oh, yeah.
Saw ya.
Yes.
Exploration is rewarded!
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num!
You fuck.
Num!
He's gonna eat you.
Num!
Num, num-num-num! 
Just because you're a fuck.
It seems like something I can get up.
Nope.
Nope.
Okay.
Okay.
Hold on.
Just gonna check.
Are you guys talking about birds?
Or, the beaks?
Beaks.
Are you talking about beaks?
Um, am i enjoying it?
I'm not enjoying Old Milwaukee.
I think we've talked about this before.
I, I do enjoy, in general, Old Milwaukee Light, as a fine, that is a...
Oh, no.
I am not leaving you, friend.
That is a fine light beer.
Um, we, we're talking about Pass Me a Beer 3.
We have a couple really fun ideas.
I think I have to leave my friend there.
I think the game wants me to leave my friends, but I don't want to leave him.
He's my friend.
So I'm just gonna prance with him for a little bit while I read your comments.
I do, yeah, Old Milwaukee Light is fine.
And, you know, after, after three or four other beers, really anything you put in ya is gonna taste the same.
Old Milwaukee is a fine, cheap beer.
I like Old Milwaukee.
I like Pabst.
I like Miller Lite sometimes.
You know why?
Cuz sometimes I'm just thirsty, and want some water, so that I drink Miller Lite.
Goo, snap!
Snap.
Mm-hmm.
Um, I did see the fake concert ticket.
And who put that up?
I thought that was really funny.
Because we were talking about Nicki Minaj.
I have to leave my friend.
Friend, you will be missed.
I present to you, my muscles.
Goodbye.
Oh, oh, you can climb the ropes.
Good to know.
Wait.
Check for trinkets.
Ah, so no matter what, I would have had to get rid of my friend.
Oh, my god.
How did I do that?
Did you guys see that super special move?
How did I do that?
Should I jump off?
Yes.
I did.
Oh.
Yes, exploration is rewarded!
Hello, friend.
I'm sorry to leave you here yet again.
Combo mvoes.
Oh, combo moves.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
It must be...
Yes, this game moves so smooth.
Must be the blast processing.
Oop.
Here we are.
I think we're finally out of...
Oop.
You dicks.
Oop.
Oop.
Ladies.
Yeah!
Exactly what I wanted to happen.
Exactly what I wanted to happen.
That was wonderful.
What was that?
Chicken.
Oop.
What is that?
Get out of here.
Oop.
Skeleton in here, and I'll getcha.
Is there any rhyme or reason for which bricks can be...
I don't think so.
Oop.
Nice.
Flawless!
Cheeseburger.
Now you just have me thinking about that cheeseburger voice.
I don't know if you guys know this, but Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a really great movie.
That Miller and Lord, they make good stuff.
They did, uh, they did Lego Movie.
They did, uh, 21 Jump Street.
They did, uh, they did Cloudy.
Oh, wait.
So that was a secret.
Okay.
Miller, Miller and Lord.
Writing duo.
Who does some weird stuff.
Who makes movies that shouldn't work, but somehow do.
Yeah, do it!
Oh, sorry.
Getting excited about...Tiny Barbarian. 
Umm...um, OctoJay has yet to request any Rich Evans nudes, but, you know, I'm not saying they're out there, but, but the thing I'm not saying.
That's, that's, that's what I'm gonna say.
I'm not gonna say that there are Rich Evans' nudes out there in the world, but that thing that I'm not saying.
So you guys can put that together any way you want.
Oh, wait.
Oh, oh, oh, you can't go back.
Oh, fuck you, game.
Ooh.
Oh.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Floating platforms.
Always floating platforms.
That's the only way I want to kill bats now.
Oh, they're just gonna keep coming.
Aww, dammit.
Oh, no.
Uh, TotallyNotAJoke asks, uh, says, Jack, please explain the absolute masterpiece that you created: Hey Hey, Heehee, the Peepee Song.
Doesn't it speak for itself?
It was just, it was a silly song that I thought was funny, and I thought...
Oh, fuck.
...uh, I thought it would be a funny video.
That's it.
That's it.
I thought, I thought it would be really funny to have a guy look really stupid, and, uh, when I can't pay for actors, the guy is you.
That's how I work sometimes.
I'm sure...
It seems like there'd be a secret down here.
Yes.
Chicken?
But I spent life to get here.
Fuck you.
Kind of a little, that's a little fuck you.
Uh, so that's it.
That's, that's the entirety of my story for the Hey Hey, for the Peepee song is, it's a dumb little song that I was singing one day because I do that sometimes, and I thought it would be funny.
And I think it is.
I think it's very funny.
I think it's very funny that anyone would, that anyone would sing that song.
So I think it holds up.
I think it holds up just fine.
Proud is maybe not a word I would use, but, you know, I like it.
I know that's a thing that the people on the internet fixate on.
I know that because that's one of the very few videos that I have on my youtube channel that get views regularly, so I know, I know it's you guys.
I know you guys are watching it because that's about it.
If I could have hired any actor for the Peepee song, any actor, who would it be?
You know, it would have to be someone...what I was going for, I was, I was going for, like, a really bad timing.
This is very obvious.
I was going for a really bad, like, children's show host, and so I would have wanted someone like, like, Steve Burns who did the, uh, Blue's Clues.
Uh, you know, someone who, who was a, uh, a children's host, a children's programming host, because that's the joke I was going for is, like, it was like a really bad children's programming song.
So, in lieu of, in lieu of actual celebrities, that's what I will say is I wanted it, I wanted it to look like I was trying to make...
Oh, fuck.
I wanted it, I wanted it to look like I was a, like I was trying to make legit children's song, which of course it's not.
It's a ridiculous song, uh, but, you know, if I, or maybe, you know what, maybe, like, maybe like a, like a, like a lady host.
I dunno.
Just some dumb song I made.
I think it's funny.
And I think it's funny.
Hey hey, hee hee...
Oop.
We all think different...
Get outta here, bat.
Bat!
Bat.
I get that bat with my sword.
Get outta here, bat.
Bat.
Bat.
Bat.
That helps, by the way.
IT helps if you say the name of the thing that you're hitting with your sword, real-...
Oh, good.
Come here.
Come here, dingus.
I need chicken.
Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here.
Don't run away, don't run away.
I got a chicken from him.
That's all that matters.
I got, I got me my chicken.
Bat.
Bat.
Bat.
You think, uh, you think I'm joking, but it really does help.
See, look.
What happens when I don't say bat?
I don't hit the bat.
Oh, fuck you, bat.
Bat!
Who needs some chicken?
Oh, fuck.
Boss battle.
And, dead.
All right.
But...
And by swords, Jack means penis.
Ooh, there's some chicken.
That's good to know. 
I don't want chicken yet because it's boss battle time.Can I knock his bombs back at him?
Yes, yes I can.
Don't...
Oh, okay.
He's got his whip.
Nope, okay.
All right.
Nope, I, I knew it, yeah, I saw that coming, you jerk.
Could use a super move right about now.
Ooh, there we go.
There we go.
Yeah blow up on him.
Oh, ech.
New sub, EdWhitten.
Hey, EdWhitten.
Thanks for subscribing.
I totally appreciate it.
And thank you, OctoJay, for letting me know when people subscribe because I miss it sometimes.
Oh.
Yes, oh, I gotcha.
Oh, gotcha.
Oh, gotcha.
Oh, come on.
Down.
Oh, he's getting me, guys.
He's getting me.
Knock the bombs to where he'll jump.
Yeah, I need to dodge the bomb, and then get close so he jumps.
Come here.
Throw a bomb.
Oop.
Throw a bomb.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Now you're just, now you're just being difficult.
What?
I had this down before, and I'm missing it now.
Well, at least I got it.
I'll get this.
The horny whippers.
Ha.
Jack, stop being terrible.
Absolutely.
I'll work on that.
I'll work on getting good.
That's my number one priority right now.
Getting good.
Hey, now.
Hey, now.
Okay.
Okay.
Shakma!
Oh, SeanofNoise, that's exactly what I wanted to hear.
Oh, I can't forget the first chicken up there.
Oh, fuck you, guy with bomb.
That should have hit him, too, right?
Every time I, every time I think I have this, as it turns out, I spectacularly do not.
Okay.
Don't run into the bomb after you, don't run into the bomb after you hit it.
Got it.
Throw the bomb.
Hit it.
Jump.
There we go.
There we go.
Get outta here.
Oh.
Fuck you and your bomb throwin' ass.
Get outta here.
Pro-tip.
Thank you.
Protip: try not getting hit by bombs.
You're right, you're absolutely right.
Tiny Barbarian, what is best in life?
To hear the screams of your enemies and the lamentations of your women.
Uh, everyone should go see here Conan the Barbarian.
And The Destroyer.
That's good, too.
This is my plan now.
Well, this hit the bomb.
I'll wait him, I'll wait for him to come to me.
Oop.
Not working the best, but, you know, I'm staying alive fractions of seconds longer.
There we go.
What if I get really close to him?
There we go.
There we go.
Dammit.
Nope.
Okay, not too close to him.
I have to get close enough to him to where he's throw-, or, far enough to where he's throwing...
Oh, fuck.
Okay.
You're right.
Arnold would probably win this game.
Dammit.
Come on.
I'm getting my tiny barbarian ass handed to me.
What in the what?
What in the what?
Because I can't hit him with my sword.
I want to pick up the bomb, but I know I can't do that.
Like, you would think it would be knocking the bomb back at him.
But that doesn't work because if you knock the, you know, the bomb drops...
Ah, fuck you.
The bomb doesn't knock back.
It just kind of drops dead.
How did you know I was gonna be there?
I didn't know I was gonna be there.
You're right, TotallyNotJake. 
You got this, Jack.
Just focus and keep your eye on the prize.
Focus.
Okay.
What is he doing here?
How can I beat him?
Nope.
Already down.
Already down a little life peggle there.
I have to let him jump over me, is the thing.
Dammit.
Dammit, bomb.
Power bomb.
Jumps over me.
Is that it?
Is this, is this the whole game?
Nope.
Oh.
Come on.
Now that's, that wasn't just not nice.
Oh. 
Oh, okay.
Okay.
I think I'm getting it.
I think I'm getting it.
I think I know how to beat him.
Okay.
So I need to be. like. this many blocks away.
Nope.
This many blocks away.
Nope.
A little bit further.
Like this, this here.
That bombs gonna come back and get him.
There we go.
Oop.
There we go.
There we go.
Now we're bomb dropping.
Oh.
Oh, what?
What?
Ughh, ohh...that was a close one.
That was a close one.
I got this, though.
I, well, I mean as much as I had it before.
There we go.
I gotta get that bomb behind him for the next time.
All right, all right.
Oh, fuck you.
Bomb ass...bomb, ya bomb ass.
There.
There, you need to be on this side
Oh, fuck.
Come on.
Nope.
Okay, too close.
Hit the bomb.
There we go.
Hit you with the bomb.
Oop, too close.
Okay.
He's gonna throw bombs, too.
All your minions are dead, yo.
Oh, fuck you.
Get outta here.
Oh, no.
I hit that with my sword.
I can't, uh, I can't choose when I do the thrust attack.
The thrust attack is just after three.
Here we go.
Back away from him.
Let him throw his stupid bombs.
Throw your stupid bombs.
Get out of the...
Son of a bitch.
Oh, son of a bitch.
Yeah, come here.
Oh, too close.
Oh, fuck you and your moblin minions.
Yeah, these are not, these are not good spikes.
The spikes only take one health.
There we go.
Get that over him.
Get hit.
And wait for him to throw bombs.
Ooh, gotcha with your own bombs, yo.
What are you gonna do, throw more bombs?
Weird.
Oh, too close.
Okay.
Already?
Guys shouldn't be here already.
All right, come on, throw your damn...
Throw your damn bombs, yo.
Fucking, one of these bombs needs to hit this guy.
Oh, fuck you.
Come on, come on, come on.
There we go.
Fuck you, guy.
Come down here and fucking fight me.
Don't...what?
This guy.
We're gonna get this guy.
I can tell you that.
I can tell you that we're gonna get this...fuck...
Oh.
Oh, okay.
This is interesting.
Okay.
Apparently, we can use the stab attack to throw a bomb at him.
Okay, okay.
We got, we have where we...
We now have some new information.
We now have some new information.
Oh.
Oh.
I think we just did it.
I think we just did it.
I think we just did it.
Jump!

[Part IV]
oh I gotta get whatever that is there's
always more secrets
chicken coinage
oh there's more chicken up there can I
still get that now fuck it do you feel
good I do that I do feel good and you
know I do want to oh my god this this
game just keep on going someone I think
a little bright here Oh]
no I'm sure Dark Souls it feels very
good to win and I am still interested in
general and playing I miss that chicken
time mr. chicken I'm still interested in
playing to ourselves it's just you know
no offense to you guys but you kinda
ruined it for me
no no not really it was just you know it
was definitely very tough playing while
streaming and your advice
oh fuck your advice was not the best
just putting that out there and I know
you know that and that's part of the fun
for you guys
but
I feel like of my life I feel like my
first time playing that game was not how
the developer intended it to be so I
will get back to Dark Souls chicken
prioritize chicken over coins any day
Jax one rule if I prioritize chicken of
the coins
and over coins 2014 10 points but if
there is no chicken then get all the
coins you can
oh my god
we're getting slightly murder rated
oh come on I just want to make it I want
to make it past the level where I can
pause it now look that's all I want to
do and the game is not giving um hey
sigh yeah oh I saw ya couldn't do
nothing about it
okay okay okay
I feel like I feel like Dark Souls
that's a video game here's a really
nitpicky thing about Dark Souls is I was
not a huge fan of their checkpoints I
felt like it like if you had you had to
defeat Dark Souls in in one life with no
checkpoints like you know always there
from the beginning I wasn't a huge fan
of how you like a leveled off and then I
also have no idea what I'm talking about
because I did not do very well with when
I play Dark Souls so don't listen any of
my criticisms to the large
as someone who enjoys really hard games
almost felt like Dark Souls wasn't hard
enough what
a real thing that I just said didn't get
that coin
come here elf
hey chicken can we check pause we gotta
take a break
hmm we gotta take a break my thumbs are
a little sore okay I'm gonna run a
commercial we are gonna take a little

break just because I need a little break
and we'll be right back

got a jump such is the way of the tiny
barbarian
and also it's like really hoping that
tiny barbarian lived in the normal sized
world and he actually just was tiny but
apparently it's just pixel found because
everything seems to be tiny
oh my god there's gold now I almost
wanna die to get that gold yo you know
everything
tiny barbarian is tagging and everything
is tiny and that's not a world I want to
live it I was hoping he'd be fighting

the answer is in yep
jump over all the things such as the way
of time
fuck well that night no go get more

yes beyond infinite Robin Williams
World's Greatest Dad
directed by Bobcat Goldthwait I have not
seen it J loves that movie
I've heard great great things answer the
cigarette question is there a cigarette
question I've heard really great things
about world's greatest dad I don't know
if I'm ready to see it yet I'll tell you
what's the question you know what you
tell me what the question is I'll tell
you whether or not I want to answer it
oh yes sir Thank You Otto J no none of
us smoke cigarettes smoking cigarettes
is one of the dumbest things you could
ever do I used to smoke I smoke you know
what that's gonna get me started into a
story so I will start blanket I smoked
ran ran right on high school for a
little bit like I want that chicken cuz
I know it's there I know that chicken is
bad smoking is just the dumbest thing in
the world it offers no it offers you no
real benefit you know because you're
addicted to the nicotine nicotine is
such a paltry hi
you know like I understand drinking and
drugs like I understand the appeals that
because of the high that you get but
there is none other cigarettes where
it's so weak compared to other drugs and
it's just like do other drugs just
possibly the worst advice I could ever
give to anyone it's to other drugs but
uh but you get it here I am giving that
advice
I think smoking and I used this one if I
was I'd take for a good year and a half
I was a oh my god
pack-a-day smoker Lucky Strikes filter
Lucky Strikes like a shrink it means
it's toasted my brand
okay it's toast
I'm gonna get to do how the drugs jack
right no you know it's like I can like
get out of drugs the other drugs make
sense as to why people do them but
nicotine is so weak by comparison where
it just does not make sense you know
there there's no nothing good comes out
of cigarettes is stinky and the high is
incredibly not worth the cost as far as
I'm concerned it's always a cost-benefit
analysis right but the nicotine buzz
they get is not work it's not worth how
expensive cigarettes are not awful you
smell and you know you lose your taste
buds it did it it boggles my mind that I
ever was a small parent
fuck you snake but you know that's
that's how you gonna do it sometimes
you're young you don't know any better
that's the whole thing just gonna tread
barrel because you're young and other
people smoking you think smoking is cool
cuz it's the man doesn't want to do
right which I mean my age I don't know I
don't know can you still I don't know
smoking still like a big thing it was
definitely you know like for my
generation you know Tarantino is just
getting big and all the people smoking
tank and movies and so it was just oh
yeah it's be cool crack is whack the
drugs drugs are okay as long as the
highs worth the price right that's the
that's the real thing is the high work
price now just monetary not just
monetarily but also socially you know
like crack I'm sure the highest grade
and the price is very reasonable but you
know you can go around and be a crack
party
I don't think I don't know I'm also not
a crack head so it's not my not my bag
crack is not a socially acceptable
so so you know there's a price not only
with the cost of crack but also with the
but also you know we're hangin how will
the jack 30 yes
32
yes well I say I say yes they're not 32
and at my age
I just I feel very practically about
drugs and I've done I've done some drugs
so
I have the data to back up my my
theories
snake I'm also just feeling it I'm
failing
Lucky Strike it's toasted
that's okay if you're a little someone
have asking the question who's a better
director J or Mike neater I'm sure
they're both fine it's tough because I'm
their friend like whenever I have to act
in anything of theirs they give me
almost no Direction just because I I
know this dick but sometimes I'll ask
for direction neither of them are quite
good at
either them are quite good at directing
me but I just think that's because I'm
up French both Codell stories I don't
want Kroger domains so I don't know if I
have any stories to tell you
madmen reference neither of them are
quite good no any Knights directing is
hard directing is a very hard thing and
I think I don't know if it's like
first-day stuff I don't know if they if
they are having a dual director role or
if it's directed by Mike usually Mike
takes on more of the directing and Jay
takes on more of the cinematography so
that I know just in general I don't know
if that's true perspective apprentice
please I don't know if that's true for
space-time but let's assume it is
because
chicken yes chicken just when you need
an entire wall chicken Thank You game
Thank You game for knowing when I need
chicken where does our
dr. go
Oh drug stories uh you know I did some I
don't have any like particularly like
drug your story
I don't let's see if I have anything
good you know
I don't remember to wear like cotton
balls today because I did lots of drugs
you know right out of high school I
would have a definitely smoke bomb with
my friends and eventually I stopped
smoking but because I got really
paranoid like dangerously paranoid to
the point where I wouldn't leave my room
I would I would stay in my room and play
metal gear solid all day which by the
way did not help my pair you know I
would just get so any sealer living the
best way to describe it and at that time
I was sharing a house with some guys and
I had the basement room
both Paul - fucking christ that was
awesome I did
oh hey so what would happen was my
friends would start getting high and one
of them with detective might come down
and bring the drugs to me because I
wouldn't go upstairs because drug
reasons it wasn't an everyday thing like
I still have a job you know like I went
to work but that's it that's what I
would do I would just go to work and and
come home go right down to my room and
wait to draw just to come okay so you
know not a bad life I say but I stopped
because
because I've just got to parent our nose
that having fun anymore
and haven't done it since it's been a
long time since I've done any sort of
drug yeah that's the thing like it just
made me anxious and it made me it maybe
not I don't know
you know what fun it was fun like when I
was a knife thrower let's see here you
know like good drug stories I don't know
if I have any I I can tell you one time
if anyone has ever done drugs you have
probably hung out at your drug dealers
house for a little bit which we used to
do you know like he was our drug dealer
I wouldn't necessarily call Mr lorry end
but you know we hung out a lot mostly
because it was their drug dealer at one
time
one time while at his house
this got a secret
I forgot all the way back
one time while hanging out at his house
can't okay I guess
there was a rather
there was a rather attractive lady there
and I was commenting to a couple other
people you know not attractive this lady
was and they were all giggling because
you know I don't know why cuz I was
lying I didn't get one everything there
was gay and so I was encouraging my drug
dealer friend to angel came to introduce
me to the lady and he's starting to get
going a lot too and they're like they
were encouraging me to go pick her up I
was like oh you gotta you gotta you
gotta do your thing and I I'm no good
any of that sort of thing so you know
like I started I said chatting her up
doing two enough things doing the
business that's what I call it which is
why
never did except for my wife
and this this lady started giggling -
and you know you know your moves are
working when the lady is gay as it turns
out this lady was a guy we just dressed
very androgynous Lee and so he took it
as a compliment
that I thought he was awaiting that that
means that his outfit was working I did
not find it so amusing as I was you know
dude
and hitting on dudes ain't my thing so
of course all my friends knew this guy
and knew I was hitting out of you the
entire time said nothing
friends that's a good story
hey you know I don't know like he was an
androgynous dude
and so I don't know if I would have
known bad I don't know if I would have
been known that he was a lady or was not
a lady but kids don't do drugs you laid
on dudes no he wasn't them like he
wasn't a UH like a transgender he was
just he just liked dressing feminine you
know like we call that a transvestite I
don't know I don't know what the correct
term for any of this is but it was a
funny story I had I've read and run into
him a couple times after that and you
know he would always get a kick out of
that eventually one day I saw him like
one day I was hanging out with him and I
saw like he must have not done his
makeup well that day or something but I
saw like how masculine I saw his
masculine features and I was like how
did I
that was a lady but I did fuck off
here we go yeah
I see here I have really fond memories
of listening to New York I think we
talked about be or feel on the last ring
airplane pause for our flame taking I
was taking a car ride to like this cabin
I can help get up there on a car ride -
it's like cabin up in the woods and I
never heard Bjork before that and man
pot makes music better which again it's
a terrible thing to say
look lychee snake I saved you
I saved you from an eternity of touching
us you're welcome snake Oh
so their first child a mascot thank you
so you know driving for several hours
listening to York while getting getting
high and dude we got high and snorted
ritalin I want to say that was the thing
I don't know if that's a thing people do
but that's what we did does you know we
were young ago and that that was some
good times just listening to the arc and
zoning out still really enjoyed York
thank you know how I enjoy that BR she
is one classy lady
this guy's great
Oh
yes yes this now
Thanks Thanks
you know I don't I'm sorry if I don't
have any good stories for you it's the
only way to enjoy Bjork no I still enjoy
York
oh crap bull crap and see that now oh I
see I see what's going on here
get up here a little bit well fine fuck
I still enjoyed yoga I think I think
she's fine I enjoy her music and do the
things that come out of her crazy mouth
oh oh you can hit it back that would
have been good to know
Kirk is amazing I believe that and
absolutely like that I've never seen
your own flat side did you want some of
that I mean you know no but real good
drums were just like I said eventually
eventually it was just me hanging out in
a room by myself which is no which is no
way to live in case you didn't know that
already
like I mean I can tell you the story of
when my good friend punched me in the
face that may be like that there was a
there's a transgression between a friend
and I have some unspoken trust was
spoken unspoken trust was broken between
a friend tonight there we go coinage and
one day while doing drugs we decided
that we needed to settle we need to
settle the score because we were gonna
hang out no matter what and so we did a
super smart thing and we decided to get
really high and have him punch me square
in the face because then you know like
it would be even I can I transgressed
over the unspoken rule and and he would
punch me in the face and so we wrapped
his hand in a t-shirt
he'd punched me square in the face
and the only the only negative side to
that is don't know if you've ever been
punched in the face but you know it
hurts we're gonna get that chicken no I
don't need the chicken actually and
apparently if you are on drugs you pass
out if someone punches you in the face
which is something neither of us knew so
it scared the living crap out of him
look at baby Beth

English boss fight ever

know what the final boss in this game it
but this feels like it did

friend punch me in the face and I passed
out for a good long time but now we're

Jack's life is a richard linklater when

another appearance at no brand gun

conventions once a space cop has done so

55 days five years yes

a creators point of view the time that I
was on drugs was the time I got the
absolute least accomplished that means

was on the drugs
and I collect your pretty package

me

was I was just not the kind to do it
