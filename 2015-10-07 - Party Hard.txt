[Part I]
waiting for Lisa to get home but there's
no idea how long that's gonna be
nor do I so I'm just started streaming
button because fucking fucking here's my
idea for a spooky game because whatever
whatever we can change it up on jackets
here doom doom that's gonna be a lousy
rich heaven solo stream right on talk
much also I'm going to suck because the
way I have this set up this I you know I
was expecting to be story more Jack so
ultra violence I think ultra violence is
a fine difficulty I don't have my good
nice gaming first-person shooter mouth
so oh shit I'm doing this on it I'm
using a standard cheap Mouse and it's on
like the couch the arm of the couch so
this is gonna work out just great let's
reload do I have everyone damn it
options see normally I got my nice Mouse
has like four buttons on the side and
one of my side buttons is reload and now
I got a what yeah that's mouse 2 is not
reloading why isn't mouse to real oh oh
fucking shit fucking bullshit that's
what it is
alright why aren't you reload
okay
oh I am fully loaded I'm an idiot I'm
looking at the wrong side I am a dumb
purchas a moron
everybody riches the moron rich is
stupid
all right stupid that didn't reload no
okay it's not reloading the reload
button doesn't work and I don't know why
oh fuck off game do you just not like
this mouse and oh fuck okay so I can
only reload by running out of ammunition
this is fucking bullshit
I've been reloading in a dream game and
a my I don't even have my run button
oh no I missed my nice Mouse so much so
much so much cock trolls
where's my run title run Oh God
we work for run you won't reload but
will you run are you just won't reload
most you won't reload it will run
actually nothing will reel of because
that's not working right
why that's too weird there's got to be a
reason for that
and I don't know what it is
why are you not reloading you stupid
weapon
let's try that
there we go why are the two options this
rebind reload and one of them doesn't
work that is the silliest thing I think
I've ever seen keep mind I'm using this
mouse mouse on a goddamn couch arm I
don't have any of my equipment and it's
driving me nuts
how's everyone doing in that chat I
can't see because I'm playing the game
just assume I'm reading everything and
love you all very much
yeah I don't plan like crap
what are you complaining because this is
it a scary a spooky game and you know
you talk about dead space in the chat I
look over occasionally no I forgot to do
that but the scary thing is that I'm
using a shitty Mouse on the arm of a
couch that's what's scary that should
that should frighten anybody who cares
it all about games and the way they are
playing
merci
probably use it for secondary fire
that's that's obnoxious I guess I don't
have one no I have to have
now when I get home I'm gonna set all of
this shit back the way it was all of it
back there we go
die motherfuckers
almost gotta fall in there
yeah
do I feel compelled to shoot up a school
now you people you people
here footsteps hello
yeah I'm streaming it happens then late
family comes first that's probably you
should never have a family huh boom yeah
I started with is the most III I'm
playing this with a shitty Mouse on the
arm of college so I don't want to do
this for long
well we got the thing here and he came
then he left right away jack is now gone
leaving me to the harsh realities of the
world yet again
who's ever this is mine now
you know my cats and rivets
shitty job and a very shitty job well
way to go way to go and then I was made
a little extra Lynch I made a little axe
really because I was talking to two
Jamis downstairs yeah
about some extra shots I need to do and
some shots that I don't need to do for
the captain space so he's filling a hard
drive full of goodies for me good that's
a major progress time this week on the
light bars and the such
you know what I had today what some some
some potato chips I feel bad for you if
there wasn't a kitchen full of food
ten feet away from you what do we have
in there you are here every day if you
don't know what's in there I'm gonna say
this is your that's all other people's
food other people I said I think it's
community food yeah they have all said
that it's community food and so I I want
to be that jerk eating somebody else's
lunch you know if it happens once I
think it's acceptable and so I'm
officially not going to feel bad all
right so are we we're doing something
else because I can't stand playing doom
with this shitty mouse ARM arm of a cow
a proper mouse pad sure it's terrible
sure terrible the fridge is full of
mustard you're right I had doughnuts no
I saw bagels over there as a oatmeal
oatmeal's the delicious food I saw many
things over there that it that it's open
for the eating's I was gonna leave you
know I was gonna go walk to the subway
earlier but I I didn't know when you're
gonna show up I don't want to not be
here you know with you at the door no I
mean you know it's fine it's fine that
was a little up in the air but like I
said damn there's free food I don't
actually know if you fell down four
times you'd be in there all right we've
talked about me not wanting to steal
other people's food yeah I thought we've
talked about any but it's open its open
from what what it what is the chattin
what what's it what's the jet say Oh
Deadly Premonition I think Jay would
appreciate that ly premonition somebody
else mentioned party hard was Deadly
Premonition the one that was supposed to
be like the Twin Peaks inspired maybe
yeah do we have that we can we get it
online
what's party hard um I mean let me
Google some stuff here party hard I
already own I already own party hard it
was gifted to me like the other day
actually timely very timely I enjoy the
Andrew wks
party hard that's wait is this a spooky
butter person who kills everybody at a
party okay if we can count this as a
spooky game then you know it's up so why
not right I I'm just gonna counter this
game because we haven't and okay hold on
I'm going to update the stream party
hard
oh how is the sound of this relative to
everything right now it's looking a
little loud it's looking I get a town
I gotta turn down pretty far I miss I
don't I was pretty young in the eighties
those that find good grades great great
all right it's perfect everything's
perfect perfect yeah change the game was
Freeman I did the OBS yeah there we go
it's done Minnie I gotta hit them okay
yeah it's okay here we go
here we go party party hard
this is the most game or is this a
controller game my house is bling
I know literally nothing about this game
it wasn't it just for new game okay we
are about to party hard
you have to stealth kill everyone at a
crowded party
think slow-paced oh okay cool yeah kind
of spooky Hemi acting in an indie game
who would have thought that somebody
with no budget couldn't afford
professional actors okay you might be
using
oh yeah okay great next to kill well
nobody is watching
okay okay why need to activate trap
someone saw you he's running away okay
okay everyone there's another guy by the
motorcycles um Oh him all right oh and
you start dancing yeah you know I think
this might be this might have been a
situation where they they should have
just cut the voice-acting yeah wherever
oh my god just to kill everyone yeah so
like this isolated person up here
probably be easy pickings oh sure okay
now what does dancing dude dance
maybe that helps you blend in Oh rich
you missed yeah I know I missed Oh
someone saw you kill him before they get
to the phone oh all right let's try this
again what can we do
maybe there are some traps you could set
I'd miss them do it okay
yeah hide body okay okay fine Clem oh
there's someone there's two people
asleep in the bathroom I bet you could
kill them pretty easily all right
oh no I see I see quite a stab nice make
sure to close those doors so I guess
they see by what proximity I I don't
know I have no idea how this works
oh that looks like a trap did you set it
break electric box I don't know if I
want to do that yet maybe I don't want
to do it oh sure sure our Miller says he
watched screaming for the first time in
his life last night
why do you think screams all right I
think it's fine it's fine okay kill them
both at once oh you better
is there no Run button oh there's none
of us Stanley
stamina Eman aah Oh what happened oh
look there's another young couple
heading to the bedroom
go get him go get him
this is level 1 yep
this kind of seems insane for level 1
don't you think stab the cop you're
under arrest I can't stab the cop yeah
you know like scream the first scream
was an interesting thing because it was
one of those like self-aware doesn't
need I got it really gonna needed eight
sequels oh wow what's it joy a thing
yeah he is there anything lose your
surroundings wisely wish victim into
fire
muscles need I wanted to bet yeah but
they're surrounded by people they're
surrounded like piece by black black one
Oh what is that one start the engine
oh there you go oh sweet that's how you
do that can you go like cut the phone
line and probably make it too easy I'm
gonna say no oh there's a ronald
mcdonald clown okay okay nice what ha
how do they call the cops
I don't know what the fuck happened
where's the any cheap where's the any
key what the mouse was on the capture
screen oh that would bother me as well
thank you for pointing it out how the
car is gone
maybe shows up later damn it as a horse
so there is a horse there now frightened
horse need victim
this seems weird UO apparently you have
to stay away from the bodies when
someone finds it or people will suspect
us you just pile them up in the bathroom
yep oh okay so you can murder people
while other people in the same room ah
fuck rich you might be you might be I
might be terrible at the see weapons
ever this game or it might be a bad game
yeah these are the two options it was so
literally the very first time I played
the game that I'm just not good at it
yet is there a drug lab in there now yes
how's that drug lab always been there
sure why not I think there might be some
randomization which is good to the party
levels
yeah you know I I'm gonna go with
unpowered rap here I think the first
level of a game needs to be a little
simpler give me you know give me a
longer tutorial help murderer no I don't
want to be arrested and get away cap I
really like the idea of this game tell
you what I think we need to get a little
bit more of a chance that you're giving
it so far a little bit more oh I'm not
saying we should stop playing it I'm
saying I might have this pegs already
the first the first a little bit of a
game is very important rich
where are the little sparkly things all
right I'm not near a body then will the
cops just not know it was me is that you
blending in yeah yeah oh yeah then the
cop leaves nice Oh
all right now we understand thing there
are so many fantastic games that don't
need to hold your fucking hand I listen
I'm not asking a game to hold my hand
I'm asking for just a little bit more
understanding before they throw you
right in oh no I think he's got to this
thing someone must have seen you okay
okay
so if they actually see you yeah I think
you need more traps I think that the
real thing is your ears needs more
stabby stab or less stabby stab more
like like this car thing that I use all
the time let's go that's great the car
thing is great yeah you need more stuff
like that I bet there's more stuff
around the house sure my bad what is
that hey buddy
oh is that what those sparkles are
there's like little sparkles everywhere
like like shimmers and I think those are
the traps oh oh the meth lab is burning
up
did you set that on fire
yeah nice quick stab okay nothing to see
over here to do to do to do to do Oh
rich what are you doing too many too
many oh it's already beat me to death a
frat boy beat yo you can't just go in a
little crowd said seven I'm gonna put
this out there is you might be the worst
murderer ever yeah maybe maybe I don't
think you have that killer instinct no I
really don't from quite a nice guy what
I was I kind of in front of it hey dude
I got a gym it does sound a little bit
like Herbie Hancock rocket doo doo doo
doo doo doo also a little axel F hmm
look yeah what was that Sparkle over
there tyrella vanished that's a trap
what is that I'm supposed to fall on
somebody
oh if someone goes there to fall on them
yeah maybe there's gotta be something
like that looks like a drug deal there
you know it's it's like can you mess up
the drug deal and then they shoot each
other we're in the right hand middle
there's a briefcase on the ground
between two groups of people right hand
middle right hand middle okay there get
out of there go there nice nice cops we
need more cups thank you
yeah I just made a new folder okay
disregard everything
so it's not like these are shops in
addition to the old folder is there's
the system you is just those all the
shots ever yes that I need to do yes
okay I can do that all right great
you're a murderer at a house party and
you need to murder all the people Oh Jay
was looking prison simply on the screen
so if you can see you're the little
white-faced guy that's like down by the
front door yeah and you have to
stealthily murder everyone at the house
party will buy it and also not get
caught by the cops
it's called party hard you know as one
as you would think nice rich is getting
a lot better at stabbing people it took
him a while as you do as you do would
you would you like to sit for a little
bit are you getting back to work a
little high 0z you can listen to the ax
left theme on constant repeat it's as
close as they could legally get them yes
what can we do here what you guys lay
off what happened Oh
they keep screaming about you needing
food and we're done talking I love it I
don't have time to get food foot stream
we got some pretzels I might have some
pretzels
there's like I told rich there's there
seems to be an abundance of forever
don't eat the bread rich so anything
okay Jack I just poison the food yeah
okay I also broke the stove
you broke the stove I think bad things
are gonna happen
great oh yeah I don't know if we can
hear Jay Jay I'm talking I'm watching
rich attempt to stab people I'm gonna
keep talking because I was informed keep
talking I was at Shea keep talking I
should be good
oh my god should be
they saw me they saw me I kind of opened
the door okay okay one more time here we
go this is like a combination of XLF and
that other song right it's the video
with like the robot legs and roving hand
facts wrong yes yes yes Jim isn't Chad
and he pointed that out okay and we all
agreed hi Jim but I just finished the
cryo lab he listed somebody else in the
party that's great why what happened I'm
sorry I missed dad I was telling them
earlier that you were you have now given
me all of the shots yes that's it that's
it it's like a dozen and it's only like
a dozen show maybe not even that
yeah so very exciting we're getting
there every day there's less and less
for me to do in fact there's almost
nothing left for me to do which is good
that's very exciting let's just meet
personally though nobody this party
thinks it's like weird that like half
the people are dead where are all the
dead bodies this is those black pens or
body bags the cops come in occasionally
and these people are still just dance
yeah well you know nobody's eating my
poisoned food I'm very disappointed oh
look at that creepy guy coming isn't it
oh is that a rival murderer where I'm at
where my other which one are you rich
the one with a circle around oh oh yeah
that's it who's that guy yeah
Oh No Oh your there's a guy there shit
oh they got you now oh shit
what a weird concept for a game yes yes
it is oh yeah they just arrest other
people if they don't see you you're here
you must have done it how we kill these
fuckers eat this I poison that food eat
that food Eden oh wait one broke away
broke away right middle you just got to
pick them off as they break away right
so sorry eventually just gonna be one
person on the dance floor side of the
screen oh oh that's that's just that's
just that's just right side of the
screen well oh you know I like looking
in this area I was breaking it up into
like 9 quadrants
hey baby that was kind of disturbing I
haven't gotten tired of the music yet oh
crap
nice nice trap I know you want it oh oh
you can just pick guys up yeah yeah
sleeping fix sleeping guys up okay can I
just throw him in the soup
oh he woke up in my hands
oh god run run stab him in run oh oh oh
they got you they saw ya they got you oh
that was good that was close for a
sleeping cocksucker
well next time don't throw them in the
sewer or stab him first bus did okay
those won't try no no I uh we know well
if we have any chance of beating this
level I think you're our only hope
you've never even tried yeah I'm gonna
go through a learning curve again oh
there's a gun up there now
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo you can break the
trees some of this thing what does that
mean oh there's a fire I think we
started that fire
yeah I did start her
oh why I was there panic though somebody
died over here I don't know why it's an
unrelated down yeah yeah I guess we're
game
yeah it's parties sometimes people just
die sometimes the entire party dies oh
my god oh you killed all the
firefighters yay
I killed the firefighters I think so how
did I do that with the tree oh they in
the fall they were in the bedroom
good yeah you did good you think I saw
you know they didn't see you get away
from the bodies get away anybody's
officer you need to see this
the bodies by me
the old bodies by me
whoops to do upside she found an awful
mysterious trap
oh is that what it is yeah there was a
bear trap in that other game the leek a
hue like view cabin Lakeview cabin you
know bear traps I think video games
think that bear traps are more common
thing than they are there's somewhere in
the world where bear traps are an
everyday thing oh I'm sure several
places places with high bear populations
I don't guess bear traps are great bear
traps
somebody dressed like Ronald McDonald
yes yes it is we have to kill them okay
burn it what fire the cops aren't onto
you until the handcuffs are over your
head bTW there's a lady with a heart
over again
she wants to smooch that guy on the
computer there's no interest no that's
very that lady smooches why did this way
this man sleeping in the room that just
burned down have you never been to a
house party before there are people
laying everywhere when when you're at a
house party
you just you find a place that no one
else is sleeping on and you sleep on it
that's how it works
or you pass out or you passed out
there's a boat level nothing absolutely
nothing
I think bodies oh you killed a cop
wait how do I do that with the trap you
laid
oh the fire exception I'm so clever
fuck man you kill the clap being there
as a body just did it
just hit it now these cops keep showing
up and they find these bodies and they
just allow the party to continue they're
very incompetent
they do very very important body bags
and then just leave them at the party
yep my dad's I'm here this game is not
very realistic
that's fine about that that's it I'm
calling the cops that guy yeah dance it
now yeah yeah and I think your guy is
wearing a hockey mask
by the way ah so he is just as this
party wearing a hockey mask if somebody
else dressed like Ronald McDonald yeah
this shit happens who is a costume party
doo doo doo doo
you can't leave but I'm yeah yes you can
but you just oh all right yep
casual casual casual murder yeah oh I
can't what did I get away with that
no how did I get away with everyone
who's watching I guess everybody's
partying hard already such things
whenever you've made a calf the next one
will be coming down here no right now
I'm just hiding in this corner all right
I don't know I'm stronger even means hey
where's your sewer no no yeah you can
always hide bodies and garbage cans
quick tip hey fatty
yummy hey go good boy good boy
fatty have you seen my donut huh I got
this donut over here
speaking of donuts is that your big
weird pastry in the fridge I take by
your face so that it doesn't know
there's a big weird pastry in the fridge
and I've no idea where it came from how
long has it been there I don't know I
just noticed that today pastry I don't
know what it is or where it came from
it's there or elsewhere well rich if you
get really hungry there was a mysterious
big weird pastry if you're feeling
adventurous feeling somebody oh oh no oh
and you messed up she's gonna finger you

away anyway oh are you kidding me I'm
too old for this
oh my god that word no wait you a
plumber he's just like Maria Oreo oh my
god he punches you back though
oh you can't stab them you can't oh why
can't you stab him because he's ma react
apparently Mario fights back
look ed the owner if he fights back if
you stab him like that should still
count for something
well then he just loses he's just there
to take away the thing I was using to
get away is that it maybe no I think
he's like hunting you know me to the
thing but the thing no that was him like
kicking and punching you look he's like
he's after you yeah
nope now he's distracted yeah just
blocked my exit Oh what the hell he went
down the toilet went into my boy Mario
like Mario Mario doesn't go into this oh
you like pipes
he doesn't go into pipes but there are
pipes and tunnels too hey I know what if
you go he's a plumber what do you think
he does I was fucking in here that was
weird you know what that was the
weirdest thing that happened to this
game so far is this a new game I think
so
you wish I think August
oh there you go still not tired of the
music I think I could listen to excel
have fun and repeat forever I'm going in
waves
maybe maybe vary it up with the Fletch
theme it's the same guy but did it so
it's similar but slightly different it's
very similar harold faltermeyer i think
it's the guys name did you sabotage the
gun yep hey dude three people
oh no so wait how many people are left
three five
before I'm assuming you have to kill the
DJ too right maybe no no all right yeah

there whoo

[Part II]
backyard dude well I guess why is the

happening inside I'm just gonna be over
here do anything with chickens now I
need a victim stabbed the horse I can't
stand the horse but I can like make it
kink oh I see so someone gets behind it
all right yeah there yeah I care the guy
with a horse the perfect crime I'm just
gonna be over here partying with these
dudes casual there's a good one right
way whole bit about casual horses okay
it's not bit about casual horses it's
pretty good it sounds like it sounds
amazing I'm not doing it I'm sorry I
missed it it's a reference to when we
stream middle girl I snuck by two guards
by hanging off the side of a horse I'm
just horse walked by them oh just this
horse with one leg draped over it didn't
see anything suspicious about the worse
let's just say - yours just casual is it
why is that fire yeah oh there's nobody
in the room won't do you any good
Wow suck it yeah oh you can poison the
food I can poison the food this is
fuckin poison bucket we're in the main
party room there's a poison bucket yeah
nice poisonous shit one of you bows
points for the fireman killing the fire
yep oh yeah those people with the green
over their head they're poisoned yay I
did it where are you right now it's hard
to keep track when you're not you right
by the garage
oh there you oh that's candy all right
no wait how did I get into arrest
you're probably too close to a body when
a cop walked by Oh son of a beyotch
busted oh I didn't party hard enough
can't we still shout out subs we just
cluster them together now so we're not
constantly yelling out names
interrupting the stream every 30 seconds
yep actually I wish it were every 30
seconds wouldn't that be amazing
yes we found a much more efficient way
is that how other streams do it did they
cluster them together no other streams
streams casuals stay away from bodies do
it as they come there's a bear oh that's
how do you dance
dude dude dude
I guess yeah that's just the streams
that I saw like the screams that I've
seen they shout them out as they come
now does the dance button does that
actually do anything what effect does
that have - all tired and say I am well
aware of quake for love quake 4 there's
some there's some body horror and quake
forums the body horror wake for quake 4
wait the aliens in Clint for quick they
they make new soldiers by taking people
and kind of making cyborgs out of them
and they turn them into their own
soldiers and there's this plot twist in
quake 4 where you get kind of caught and
you're on this conveyor belt and like
machines chop off your legs shove like
spikes in your brain that might ships in
there and you're on the assembly line so
you see what happens to the person in
front of you oh nice
oopsie doops these seem to have gotten
run over spoiler alert quake 4 is like a
7 years old it's old
have you ever played it but now it's
your fault
yeah God what is the limit on spoilers 7
years I'm gonna say that's a I'd say sup
yeah I would say 7 years is fine but
when do you say like it's still
questionable a year two years I think
after a year three definitely three okay
yeah I would say three sounds like a
good cut off it's over three years old
spoilers are fine yeah Tiberius Kirk is
only putting two months - well that's
ridiculous
I think if it's if it's before if it's
within a year your movie your movie
might not even be released in and
whatever country you're in two months
after it came out somewhere else that's
true if it's if it's under a year then
you need to give the warning like a
spoiler warning after after you know
still you know if it's a popular thing
give us boiler warning but you know it's
fine I think after a year
near anybody I was still in film school
when the $0.06 came out okay I hadn't
seen it yet and this is of course before
the end I mean the internet was the
thing but it wasn't like constantly
being bombarded with information the way
you are now sure oh nice oh I did not no
not nice enough I did not know the
twists and one of my thumb professors
gave it away in class I was like you're
a film teacher of all people you should
not be given the shit away it's still in
theaters right trigger you limited very
limited stamina I think you're fucked
nope oh lucky ass lucky ass motherfucker
yep I don't know what I just did but I
there was a suitcase and I pressed Y in
front of it now I have a thing what is
that thing what is this thing right you
don't know I didn't do it before look
you know as much as I do at this point
true that Oh how's that dickhead that
called the cops on me no I guess you're
getting stabbed it quick for was
released in 2005 so ten years oh then
you're fine yeah you're fine it's really
been ten fucking years Jesus Christ I
just give me an older and older and
older never ends oh shit yourself no I

movie it is a what was it someone
someone tweeted that out at us today and
it's like a Croatian it's like a 70s
Croatian
what do you call it alright I'll reach
people in that pool there's gonna be
I've never heard of it
some kind of electrical signal someone
shared it and they they make a lot of
they made a little video about it making
a lot of visual comparisons with the
bloodborne universe now cuz it's this
young girl who's like going through
puberty and the whole movies a metaphor
for her coming into womanhood but it's
all like a very like religious town it
looks really cool looks really creepy
but it looks like there apparently
there's no blood and gore like in
blood-borne okay but everything's like
old religious check us a blocking thank
you Oh Lord Belmont I think you were the
one who made the video
it's a Czechoslovakian art house blanket
oh my god they're robbing the bank
what is great they're robbing the place
that's right oh it's a casino you're in
Vegas I get it
public enemy 11 rich and I well why is
he beating me up
who the guy Oh busted I don't know that
happened to me once to where I got beat
up for some reason rich and I probably
won't talk about the the ending of Metal
Gear Solid 5 just because that's
relatively new and we don't want to
spoil it going back to spoilers am going
back to spoilers the short version is
like every other literally every other
aspect of that story we think it's utter
bullshit the mobster doesn't think
anything of it a car just ran over half
is that crowd and look at this look at
this sorry
stripper over here oh that's sad can you
make it rain and then kill her no so she
can go out thinking she's worth
something I think we're sand that is the
guy in the pool all by himself
that's sad I think he's a butler
well now the butler went in there was
there was someone else in there but yeah
now there's someone else no that's a
fine they have just make the cop run
long enough
yep that's a second
what are the exclamation points over
some people's heads mean there are
panicked how can they see something that
I see type here's Kirk says game
spoilers I'd set a six-month limit
movies two months TVs three weeks oh my
god that's crazy town that's now that's
too quick especially with Netflix and
people you know discovering shows for
the first time all those shows yeah
exactly
wait what happened it just saw me set
the train oh you got you can do it don't
give up
believe in yourself stab believe in your
dreams stab all the people
alright alright here we go again dude
once more into the breach wait why does
it pick me up who the bouncer maybe
you're not allowed in maybe you just
can't go in that way
I've gone in that way before it seems
try stabbing the bouncer yeah yeah he's
kicking your ass how did I get in before
was he distracted by something me maybe
that could be interesting just stab him
yeah yeah we're gonna have to get rid of
bouncer there's nobody out there right
now I think you can get in now cuz
there's no line you know it's Baxter oh
there you go okay figured it out oh also
quick update oh no he's gonna kick your
ass I'll kick your own I gave up
everyone everyone in this universe is
just very lazy they don't want to
investigate too hard they don't want to
chase criminals they don't want to stop
dancing I'm fine with that I'd like to
give a quick update on my binding of
issac real platinum god run and that's a
care of the fucker bouncer nice I did
get a level four Super Meat Boy and
level four bandage girl okay that was
the thing I was trying to do on my
binding of issac stream I found a really
crazy way to do it thank you whoever
runs the movie Dick's Twitter for
sending me that that a leak too strap by
the way but apparently there is a bug in
the PlayStation 4 Vita version of vine
oh so you did it on a bug no no no so I
why is everybody oh man just walk that
way it seems random give I am sorry
not when they beat me up now you're fine
you find everything
no the the achievement didn't pop is the
problem
and so even though I got the achievement
it doesn't show it in the game that I
got the achievement and I don't know if
there's a way to fix it and it's really
frustrating see you're like fucked fart
if I don't get that achievement I can
110 percent the game and I have it it
shows up that I haven't but it didn't it
didn't pop in game and you need it all
of them to pop in order to get a hundred
and ten percent complete and it's very a
set whole Kogan where we're here where
are you yeah I don't even know where
you're right guy just stabbed give me a
quadrant like the kitchen it wasn't the
kitchen well if he stabbed him then now
he can't see I know I know he was all
alone there's a kitchen I have to stab
him oh there's the kitchen yeah
dude so what you're saying is you didn't
actually do it that's the that's the
upsetting part I said and I looked
online and there was this weird fix that
people were doing oh that leaves I
thought that was a hidey hole where I
didn't do what I thought it did okay we
have to like upload your save file to a
cloud delete the game reinstall the game
and the download to save found good some
people are saying sometimes you have to
do like three or four times but it works
and I've done it like a dozen times and
it hasn't popped yet so I sent a message
off to the developer my life is
worthless without this you know it's
something I'm working towards I
understand it is it is oh is this this
is a band playing oh you have to kill
all the band eventually yes
Oh Mario is here again be careful yeah
song that's right to Buick skirt this is
now my like third PlayStation game
glitch that might not ever be fixed fuck

that was possible why did the there's
traffic there
oh you can only kill couch with trap
okay I don't think you're using your
sword why are you using your sword I
forgot how I think I pressed like the
one of it every one of the triggers use
could just mean it's more power from the
knife or whatever it's fine it's all
fine
press the left trigger or one of the
buffers maybe there you go
look at that look at that then you get I
got like a hacky knife it kills
everybody one hit as it is I'm not sure
what it's doing for me but okay yeah
yeah more points perhaps I can get in
the water
look I don't want to that no you know
what then you'd be walking around all
wet and people would hear the squishing
noise and more traps
no I need more traps more traps
did you take them out with your hatchet
one of them did do anything different
no just took them off okay it seems like
it swing slower okay I might have more
reach
sure maybe you can take out a cop with
the hatchet sure who knows Oh rich
there's now two they're multiplying they
know they're in danger and so they're
multiplying oh yeah I see Thanks it's in
the lower left-hand corner what is ahead
the button problem for your sword strike
okay what does it do different in the
night does anybody can't give me a
concrete answer hmm I'm not asking you
oh then yeah Jane left for a moment I
don't know if he's coming back she's an
adult he has things to do most of us

the corridors easily I like how the
corner was like every class you don't
put these dicks oh there they are
I haven't been even paying attention to
that you already spiked to the punch
ball or what yep
none of them seem to want to move yeah
certainly in here I can do rip you just
have to have pay attention to where
they're looking you can kill people if
no one's looking at you oh there's
something what is that I have no idea
well let's find out it's it's gumballs
I'm okay okay
that got people to move
Oh someone in chat said that dancing
drives people away okay like you are
such a bad dancer that it makes people
leave your area okay okay I like that
we're learning things we're learning
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
yep that whole bag and now run sir I'm
gonna make it this time
you don't think yeah you can do it you
can do it you can do it it's too fast
you're made last time yeah they get
better each time
Mario screwed yeah you didn't okay you
didn't see me though okay just saw body
next time go get your freezer that's
great nope okay this is not gonna be on
the backups all right in fact I think he
just left already that cop
yeah he's bored I noticed scene and you
but did you dissolve what happened to
him I think you fell behind a body bag
no way don't stab her first stab him
first
he did it yay you murdered away you
didn't congratulations on your murder
okay I'm gonna murder people now okay go
we gotta sit through another one of
these voice acting cutscenes
skip it if you want I'll give you shit
that's a great idea
you know what I've forgotten that I can
skip cutscenes
nyan top party how did you forget that
of all people you can play someone else
now you should kick and kill all right
yeah let's try playing is this person am
i oh I'm like a lady killer now I will
crush you what
bouncer who is bored easily
sure
oh yeah look if you dance like in that
PK I'll see it oh this is like a dude
dude dude dude I don't kill a bunch of
people oh we're on a roof okay see
that's the window washers at the bottom
oh yeah that's why you shoved someone
out a window
oh I'm sure I'll have to kill those
window washers eventually right oh did
you kill everyone that was on the floor
huh yeah yeah that thing exploded and
killed a bunch of people what the fuck
just happened there I don't know that
was a lot of delayed points from killing
everybody on the dance floor remember
yeah that's great yeah I mean look at my
kill count already it's at 24 so that's
pretty great dancing huh
those games need your golf cart of
doom-- oh I know we sell a few more
people are there sure no it's right in
line with those bouncers
yeah that is a lot of fun I think I've
some special agents to arrive I'll see
you
oh my god we don't want that close to
the body
I was a window shove option maybe did
not kill that guy
well maybe she just knocks people out
maybe maybe that's her weakness maybe
that's something but I don't know I'm
speculating I don't know okay maybe I
guess I've only killed people with traps
so far doo doo doo doo - Oh too many
people rich too many people already yeah
what am I gonna do with all these look
for traps right hey baby
want to come over here on the ends
I'll get hey baby yeah nice moves that's
right bye Dave
can you press the number 4 button them
and turn that up on that microphone oh
yeah yeah yeah I need to I need to kick
him and stab him while they're down
it seems less useful than the other guy
I wonder what the advantages you have
cuffs on your head
shit shit no good how did that happen
incredibly lucky I was incredibly
incredibly lucky did it just take him
that long to get over there yeah how I
got through what why didn't you come
medical personnel
paramedics are getting up oh no some
there's a guy with a phone I must been
too close to a body I guess or well they
call the cops just when I see a body
sure that's why you might want to
consider every now and then hiding them
but oh but if they call the cops because
they saw a body they're not necessarily
gonna arrest you you're just gonna show
up and investigate hold on I want to see
if there's like some sort of I send the
sprint to use a Tamizh trap listen
that's an interesting one it's near
somebody listen look if I press it oh is
that her like maybe that's her special
thing she's a woman sir she didn't
listen is that is that what they're
trying to say that's why she doesn't
have the insta-kill knife maybe she's
got a different thing she can do do do
do word on the street is that this game
has twitch integration what does that
mean what does that mean what does that
mean
that didn't kill nearly as many people
in that thought explain which word
twitch will get twitch world - iteration
to be switched figuration yep now
bouncer chat can cause random events the
chat can come yeah how do we how do we
set this up how do we do this explain it
to rich I'm playing is this going on now
are you guys doing things or if you go
to the options and enable it the chat
gets this poem let's go to the options
two two two
nope nope not seeing it not in seeing it
oh that's how I kill all the people on
the dance floor oh that makes a lot more
sense what the I thought I it was
blowing up those speakers on top that
kid knows a thing on the bottom you have
something on the floor OOP bunch of
people are poisoned when you're dead
Jack we're gonna quit the game and go to
the main menu maybe they'll be more
options okay yeah that's gonna get
everyone wants to know how you did that
not notice what it was oh because I've
looked the speaker and I thought that
like there was a delayed speaker thing
well and there was a box like that in
the first house that just made a little
like electrified pool and so I thought
that's what that was look up oh I just
killed the window washers oh it was just
about thing Y button front yeah we're
gonna injure we're gonna integrate in
entry gate we're gonna to integrate as
soon as Jack is dead
yep are caught where well I guess only
caught I don't think you can die I think
you only get caught right could be but
which just happened hey I feel sick
let's get to a main menu quick main menu
main menu main menu options there we go
twitchcon config twitchcon think twitch
integration will allow your fans to
activate special events while you stream
party hard step 1 click on get off
button and copy your off key insert off

feature let's say I like that oh oh
conga line is taking it away I want a
conga line I definitely want the conga
line oh no this guy can listen to wonder
what that does
it just shows you where all the
interactable items are
how excited is everybody about this
twitch integration the answer should be
very so can you get a look at the back
of a conga line and just start picking
them off one by one
Oh to the body hands I got me a body
scared off the conga line oh that all
worked terribly if I move fast I can
just kill everybody in one fell swoop
by Z just gone you know and a bouncer

I wonder what a bear killer is racer
bear killer and a bodybuilder bear

the bear killer is around right oh no
this big curve I think is gonna it's
gonna go right in front of my trap you I
just want to get rid of those bouncers
here we go I kind of I kind of think
this this twitch integration is neat
you think it's neat until the bear
killer shows up I just want to know who
the schmuck is that voted body builder
and racer I don't know liven things up a
little bit I'm working on it
the police will take care of this wait
let's
stay away from poisoned people okay okay
what are they barf on you yeah maybe
it's all we gonna kill the DJ you think
yeah but it's too late now
it is you know what it is rich this is a
guy like if I if I owe you lucky fuck
what that blew up one like two people
just have to be walking by it you got
extra food that a dog a pig walking
around what is that huh there's a thing
walking around something at the top of
the screen now it's dark blue was like a
white color
oh that's is that the the bear hey bull
it's like a bull and it doesn't look
much like a bear to me yeah to do to to
to to some way what are they sending in
now a bodybuilder good well I guess
maybe it is maybe that doesn't maybe
that's what the game considers a bear
that's very much a letdown that could
look at that son looks a little bit like
a bear I can kill this guy for sure I'm
less than happy with it you're less than
happy with the best I'm happy with the
bear I'm sorry hot floor is winning the
vote hot floor hot warm all right
there's a sleeping guy there's a
sleeping guy over here we can kill him
real quick real quick kill this person
Oh she saw you fuck Ron Ron is there a
trap you've been set for the cop no
there's no speaker announcing right now
you just fucked oh I thought I could get
around the table I wonder what hot floor
oh the speaker yeah that could work
twitch integration might make that's a
little harder all right let's do this
party hard because as far as quick as
possible we could replace some of the
older levels kill as many of those
people and see what did what what
different things that's what you can do
in the sure doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo - I like this music
- now this
hey mad killer the mad Oh 53% mad killer
like I'm mad why something that another
killer will spawn zoom I guess I don't
know that cop didn't see nothing you see
didn't say nothing you just shove
somebody into the fan
shit alpha I shoved two people into the
fan oh my god that was a really good run
I felt really good about that and I got
beat up by bodybuilders again yeah yeah
you take over for a bit should try this
level or should we quit and go back to a
different way okay I think what happens
is I got so over I get so overconfident
because you can kill so many people
right away you know find a way to deal
those monsters doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
how's the boat looking to screw me

I think we're getting back up though I
don't think they actually killed anybody
oh yeah yeah what do you need to kill
the SWAT they're not going away
I do you think I know they've got me
stick around for a little while
okay the main menu editor allows you to
put more time in between votes and
shorten the amount of time we get to
vote that might be helpful what do I
want to do more time in between votes I
think oh you can't throw people from the
road oh just give her a getting rid of
bodies okay oh man the spots gone great
what's winning no looks like a special
agent is coming now fuck yeah so I think
after this inevitable death shit
the special agents
oh oh that was the fellow came in
helicopter he came out of the elevator
every time I ran the wrong way hi what
are you um uh no b.s the game and we'll
go back to the main menu and give give a
little more breathing room but between
events
oh the chats having fun okay fine get
some fun I'm fun
oh no way here let's we are gonna go
back to an earlier level see if
different things pop up okay sure
go back to barbecue party a good old
barbecue party remember they owe the the
the easy
flowy days of barbecue party we got pest
control a bouncer and a bodybuilder and
even though we haven't seen a pest
control not many people are voting for
it oh never mind they just went for it
pest control you are all alone and
that's unfortunate because I am a
murderess I am a murderer man I wish to
do terrible things - excuse me ma'am
hey I thought I was a murderer
yes that's right I do in fact cube
people what you are one witch and you
you happen to be a people I believe I
was mad are you all right it's coming up
rich we're gonna see what pest control
is look it's a horse party no pest
control oh yay a murdered people for me
what are they doing oh oh they're gonna
murder a lot of people for you they're
planting bug bombs rich what the hell
sweet that's great sweet
Oh someone's how you murder that girl I
don't believe you
there are windows do you see the hand
comes over your head oh yeah someone saw
you through the window there are options
oh he's a fast one why is he so fast why
is he's a fast god
god damn niblets I wonder if we could I
wonder if like if we got pest control
every single time and it just happened
enough could we kill everyone with just
pest control yeah um okay I'm just
knocked out I'll be fine I wanted to get
there quick okay we got body builder we
got a fire or we got a bear I think
everyone knows what to do here we need a
fire fire fire fire
there's a lovely yeah there's a lovely
song called set fire to your face on
fire it's pretty good yeah he's gonna
say that body
the body we can't play a first-person
shooter right now because we don't have
a proper mouse pad or anything like that
technically I could I try play doom for
a bit actually earlier oh fuck off but
it was uncomfortable yeah oh they wanted
fire yeah fine oh yes our Miller that
was the Blood Brothers data that youth
machete album is really fantastic if
you're into that sort of screamy thrash
laser life was the single off of that
that was a girl that's a great song
laser life okay Jack in your stand-up
days have you mentioned talking about
being a clown no I had no jokes about
being a clown in my stand-up days young
machetes not used machetes African it's
fun you know and talk about fire get
back on the fire where you going we
ain't nothing wrong with the little fire
I love that like you know you get rid of
the bodies and that alleviates suspicion
but there is just like a trail of blood
and guts and burn mechanics it's fine
fine so fine oh fuck bad don't get near
poison people why not if we find out why
not I think you might get poisoned
I think if someone dies of poisoning
right next to you and you don't die of
poisoning you're usually like suspect
number one
I guess I think you just stab Daphne or
Velma which one is the red-haired oh
that's a much better barrel oh that's a
great bear that's it
wait does the bear do anything hey this
markers I can tell it doesn't I wanted
to like Maul someone Daphne Daphne was
the redhead yeah
the Velma was the was the nerdy one what
did she see lady saw something something
she didn't like uh-huh I don't know what
there's a bear yeah oh thank you for
walking in here with me the murderer
nothing to see over here officer nothing
at all
how many people have to die before they
cancel this party all of them they are
very dedicated to this party they've
been planning it for like like months
rich this is the bi annual barbecue
mixer that's not just something you
cancel willy-nilly what do you guys want
a bear killer bear killer looks to be
top we got a pest control we got a racer

killer bear did that guy just fall down
oh you know what I do what cars that the
oh of my god it's oh it's gonna kill the
bear no no it's a bear killer he's a
killer who kills people by dropping off

bear killer he kills people with bears
ridiculous all right Gilda I killed the
bear good I killed both bears great and
Ronald McDonald good
Oh who's this guy did he know I see just
guy does he man yeah he came up last

rival killer he does have a suitcase so
maybe if you uh if you stab you can
steal a suitcase yeah see there's a
suitcase behind entry now nope nope I'm
Oh rich what what what voting has begun
anew and it is 100% Special Agent okay

you've been dumping the bodies the conga
line might actually go off without a
hitch we could actually see a conga line
it'd be great if everyone else we're
dead just follow them from behind and
stab them in the back that's I'm gonna
do 108 is it everybody oh oh oh this
might be glorious this could be glorious
Episode II just called the fucking cops

just in case I'm gonna and nothing
nothing nothing is happening the
elevators staying open what happens if
you walk over to the elevator
oh you can't throw them out of the
bottom window no I thought I could Kenna
can you go in the elevator
No so how we have we glitched for future
things showing up maybe we maybe have
I'll just kill the rest these Schmucks
and be done with it
absolutely cops coming in a little bit
some planning cause don't be seen don't
be seen I'm not near any bodies except
the one you're gonna make well first of
all obviously dude
my captors just standing there
why'd you stand in there cop some kind
of glitch I don't know just be careful
I ain't you stand to miss be careful
just be careful I'll be fine cuz that
trying to throw that girl out the window
seems to fuck things up girl the top
killer okay
oh you're gonna do it you're doing it
you're doing it you can throw them in
the sea yeah don't matter
it won't matter got them all oh my God
look at the glitchyness look at all the
glitches just it's okay I was asleep the
countertop right top right that's what
it is
thank you look at all we have glitched
it you almost sad that cop and that
could have gone badly we don't know mmm
there we go
you didn't pwned
everything is broken everything is
broken about the game but we we made it
hey hey go all right whoo I'm gonna I'm
gonna live that
hey Jack I think we're stuck here it's
not leaving the screen this may have
been for nothing
yeah well hopefully it's saved hopefully
I'd saved everyone
she had a saying they voted glitch well
this is what you get for voting glitch
all right I'm gonna minimize that no
nope
fuck fuck all right try again and hope
we have the next level unlock oh yeah we
did
oh you got an achievement called Start
party hard that's not a good sign Oh
continue Oh party we did it
alright alright boat party rich oh oh
this looks me intimate can you go inside
the boat there's that little door yeah
first bouncer nice oh you can throw him
off the boat to the Sharks yeah but she
was coming so I had to give her sir
Oh bouncer - no cop sees the bouncer
ojas I wonder if it was that man who is
walking away all right where did i
teleport - I use the door oh you up
upper left oh yeah yep see we got here
we got special agent bear killer and
pizza of course bottom of the ship seems
like the way to go well yeah that's
where you can dip both bodies that's I
mean I think that's what we've
discovered last time is like the sweet
spot is always wherever you can dump the
bodies looks like we have a special
agent coming aboard
alright alright where do they spawn I
think helicopter on the roof oh no
they're coming from the back
I don't know those phone right there yep
just a cop though I don't see the
special agent I don't think the voting's
done yet is it I think it is where's the
cop cop my back cop said fuck it
oh that that's the corner I think all
right so maybe you got lucky with this
special agent it's not much to do on
this one is there this is a simple map
yeah but you know what it's not a boat
there's a speaker you could not most
right there right now and they're so
Hogan again by the way right behind it
is and by the way that's like eight bit
like wrestling hell code how many other
different types Hulk Hogan's would there
be other than wrestling Hulk Hogan to
shape suburban commando Hulk Hogan yeah
I nobody cares about spawn idaho : i'm
sorry Hollywood Hogan was also wrestling
people are getting sick up there that's
good news
looks like you have a merchant coming
that didn't do anything last time right
well there was some kind of glitch going
on CAPS coming oh wait I think the
merchants might be the man in black can
you talk to him
hold down the listen button and you see
how now there's like a red ring around
them with an X can you talk to people
this might blow your whole thing no okay
yeah check you fucked me over you fucked
me over absolutely did I just wanted to
know I just wanted to know rich and you
know what now we know isn't that nice
isn't knowing you half the paddle this
for me doesn't do much good
this is not a visual and audio thing but
it's happening rich is flipping me the
bird I wanted to know I hope all you
know is suffering
everyone's going down here now and I
can't kill the bouncer but it's just
tragic this is tragic it's no
coincidence that that guy showed up
after they voted merchants so he is
obviously the merchant perhaps much like
the pizza guy he drops his briefcase and
you can pick up like a lemon or
something no no Oh things were going so
great so great you'll get it back it was
amazing
it'll be a bit amazing look at all these
people down here now I can't get my my
kill zone cleared enough to start don't
worry the the chats it looks like the
chat is ordering some girls maybe
that'll distract people maybe I don't
know something's gonna blow up nobody's
wrong will it blow but waits for
somebody that's nice how does one kill
that's nice oh there's a briefcase or
that where right there right out of it
that's a bomb you can plant well we know
what we're doing with us yeah I know
what you do with that so right button
set up a bomb
massive kill zone
massive kill zone oh they're just
sleeping what they're just sleeping look
at ZZZ
what kind of weak-ass bomb is that it's
a non Opie bomb I think it's the
technical term sure I get that it's not
overpowered but I mean it didn't kill
anybody there weren't a cop around then
there are less people I might be able to
stab them all down but your your speaker
killed some people so that's good oh
that's weak a flame now they're all
leaving the dance thing oh this has gone
bad we can nobody's dancing and they're
all gonna come down here they can't kill
anybody and there's no traps and there's
a bouncer and fuck it all just alright
just restart the level if you wanna stab
everyone
I do think it's funny that where am i
where am i father your your killer's
motivation is that he just wanted some
quiet yet he is he has gone to the party
but like he's like maybe I'll get some
quiet on a boat on this party boat
there's a mad killer coming after me
that is true
did you see the medic killer he goes
yeah run now ain't gonna work haha yeah
just coming after you I bet you could
push him off the boat cuz that's not
just a body dump place that's a pusher
place right there why risk it
he's almost he's almost time up why risk
it no that's just the time for the next
vote oh yeah okay okay okay okay
well yeah uncle Ivan I think like that
the the goal is to use the bomb to knock
everyone out and then just stab stab
stab but they're just there's extra
people around
you just don't care
I don't either then fuck it oh these are
no time to cover caps motherfucker when
you've got a knife in your neck doing
good things I'm feeding the Sharks what
people don't understand is that these
are endangered
tiger sharks they live on a very
specific diet of recently murdered
humans I'm doing it what
Oh Michael bikers bikers you know what
they didn't beat me up instantly so I'm
okay with that
I think they just get into fights
there's a there's a briefcase up there
yeah I don't well no way close basically
nobody left but the dance floor
sure sure how am I do but it might not
be a bomb I mean I think it's random
what else could it be
we got a change of clothes than one you
got that big sword in one
nice Ricky's got the mad strats press
your listen button yeah my check that
you know there's no thing you buy that
thing II yeah no throw off his own over
there you would think and that's the
back of the boat ripe for a throw off
zone it's fine
it's a dude standing back there like
well guess didn't see anything weird
over there see what are they sending
your way rich they are sending looks
like bear and bear killer are these are
the top ones right now little bear
killer bear killer is itching it out
gogo girls as you know it's coming up
stab stab
I like how you know you can't just stab
people in the face but you like stabbing
her in the back and you have a bear
killer coming aboard oh it's right there
I'm very confused by that by the bear
killer yeah I wonder if it just kills
the bear that if people sent a bear that
would kill the bear no no that's
possible
it seems very strange what pickup that
case you know yeah well I guess I don't
have to use it right away
what is that bomb different kind of bomb
is that a kill everyone bomb that could
be a kill everyone bomb but I don't know
assume it's not our last bomb was not a
killer drone Bob the shark has fucking
diabetes people are saying this one is
not a stun bomb I don't know if we can
trust him
well I think we've killed enough let's
try it
see what happens oh yeah they know that
put people to sleep
oh and murdered some to that that did
both looks like close to the blast
radius murdered man it's too close to
what a cop came you know silly you
didn't get out of there
hey I just up top that's a Ledge and I
my brain wasn't looking at it as a Ledge
oh sure
rich yeah that's right get it together I
don't like this bomb strategy you know
you don't like the bomb strategy that
person fell asleep because she saw you
stabbed so much fainted I got I got that
all reasoned out already
like me took me half a second thought
that makes way too much sense I don't
think I want to say that's not true just
because it makes too much sense having
good as a man wearing a speedo she
deserves to be stabbed they go topless
small breasted lady also also true
did you do rich oh my god oh shit I was
just gonna say you have a carnival one
they just yeah I didn't know I didn't
know
yep uh-oh Mario's here he doesn't seem
to be fixing anything yet but he's here
doo doo doo just - dude just - dude I
had the cops back and somebody saw him
with a body that wasn't known about them
I guess why are the cab's back
all these extra fuckers know I tried to
attack the cop from behind I thought
maybe you can step into the cops not
actively trying to arrest you sure maybe
you can get a quick killing okay you
know what it was worth the attempt it
pays to experiment sure
I think nothing I was doing nothing
standing directly behind you just look
at me yeah that's what reroll mmm give
us three more shots I believe in you I
believe in you well you give it another
shot I will uh I'll talk about I'll talk
a little bit about Wonder Woman we care
about Wonder Woman suddenly well someone
very nicely sent me some Wonder Woman a
smoke grenade
send me some Wonder Woman comics they
were they were ah a fan who enjoys the
DC Universe and they didn't think that I
was giving it a fair enough shot reading
the Wonder Woman Superman comic books oh
I was too close yep that's funny and so
they they sent me the first two trades
of new 52 Wonder Woman to you know
hopefully gain a better understanding
and appreciation of the Wonder Woman
comics and I've read them I think I have
a problem with Wonder Woman
I just I just don't necessarily care
about the whole gods thing you know is I
guess the major thing that's what I've
discovered the new 52 Wonder Woman I
guess all the wandering and you know
like there's a lot of GAD stuff I just
don't care you know
yeah which has no strong opinions no I
don't think I ever have yeah I just you
know like I I like I like my superheroes
human I like my superheroes human I like
them to be normal people
you know like so much pee basically the
you know spider-man being my favorite
superhero just just a normal kid right
yeah just a normal kid and deals with
everyday kids stuff while also punching
people that's great
the reason I think that I like the new
Batgirl so much is because her this
story arc all of her equipment gets
blowed up and Batman isn't around
and so she has to basically start over
from scratch and so she's a poor kid
dealing with relationship stuff and also
punching people so it's like it's the
closest that Batgirl can get to
spider-man which is why I love it same
with the Miss Marvel which I've been
reading and really enjoying so it's not
even just like a female comic book thing
you know miss Marvel's just a kid just a
kid dealing with stuff normal person
also punching people which I really like
but like I think this is the the big
issue with DC in general you know Batman
is a billionaire is a billionaire ninja
Superman is an invulnerable gun they're
not the most relatable characters mm-hmm
Wonder Woman is a is an Amazon princess
so that's it you know no Bruce isn't
around in the new Batgirl
she currently dead or something or what
he might be dead or just not around
because in in this universe James Gordon
is Batman in a in a robot Batman suit
it's very strange
it's very very strange and so she's kind
of by herself she had to oh my god a
shark popped up and ate someone I was
awesome was that a special thing that
the jet boat on I don't think so I think
that's just a random shirt
Batman what might as well be an
invincible yeah that's true because he's
a billionaire extremely good point and
then so this is all the thing is
relatability they have a relatability
problem DC and like this is this wonder
when these two trades all revolve around
every single one of the different gods
and the half gods and the quarter gods
fighting over Zeus's empty chair because
Zeus is gone apparently and and man I
don't care I care about it like how can
i how can that really give up cop give
up on that my god
he lasted like eight times as long as
the other cops
yeah you know what deathstroke I might I
might get into I I could see myself
getting in a desk drug but but you know
even Deathstroke is he's just too good
all the delta DC heroes and villains are
just like the best at everything ever
Deathstroke master mercenary assassin
healing abilities super keen senses the
most badass ever too badass let's try
something with a smoke grenade that's
not the majority of wonder alone comics
I have two trades you know that's one
twelve issues twelve fourteen
co-creators to ship is it
I'm just stabbing them in the squad and
nobody's seeing because smoke grenade oh
my god oh my god that's great Oh
someone's all body I don't think they
spotted you though oh oh nope nope
that's alright alright sorry no the body
really oh nice nice rich the body
builders were gonna open up fucking
bouncer I might like Jessica Jones I
don't know no Jessica Jones great I'm
looking forward to it Jessica Jones oh
oh I'm talking about the comic book the
alias but oh yeah I heard great things
about anyways
this is but but this is something this
is why I've always read Marvel / DC
Marvel has normal people with
extraordinary powers and they do that
very well I feel my opinion of course
you probably love you yeah J was here
for a little bit tonight no he's not but
now he's now I will not rest until I see
the merchant used in his proper form
well lady Bacardi how is we talking talk
to us about the merchant what do we do
with the merchant how does this play out
lady Bacardi I have popped you out
explain to us how we use the merchant in
his proper form yeah that's right it's
not so much the power level but more a
humanizing of the heroes and like if you
think about you know Clark Kent or
Superman his whole deal is he's an alien
and he feels like an outsider because he
is an outsider because he's an immortal
God Wonder Woman lives on an island of
only women and as a princess like not
not very relatable she's not big tough
Thor either I was so no I'm not a big
fan of filler I didn't know anyone was a
big fan of Thor yeah yeah I get I can
totally agree with that sentiment
he opened his coat when he opens his
coat go up to him and see if he gives
you where's the merchant you wait for
him to flash you yeah gotcha
thank you pretty I was leaving were you
hard to get back I'll fucking do my last
shot Jack you can do it
the last shot think I'm I'm rushing too
much you're not taking my time I'm not
being tactical yes being stupid
yeah like the Thor movies I think are
fine they're the movies I hate most out
of all of them not even hate moans I
just you know I just don't care about
the Thor movies because it's a bunch of
God none since that I don't care about
you be fairly close to a body let me see
it don't they oh yeah the myrrh okay
people are voting hard on that merchant
all right so what's the deal here so a
guy with the black coat yeah well come
around and then he opens up his coat
yeah and then you can like press Y or
something and talk to him okay possibly
I'll keep an eye out for him
all right all right he came at the
bottom you see him so I don't know if
you have to hang around him or or what
you have to do there button
oh hey guy hey give me change of clothes
okay I'm gonna do two game ops out well
it depends on which one you want to keep
oh hang on to this it's insurance yeah
nice there you go
and does he just sit there now he wants
to I don't care do what he wants
if John burned the one that's doing the
new Superman the Action Comics cuz I
think yeah he's the one who did Superman
in 1980 whatever a 501 is just saying I
think that I would like John Byrne
Superman in 85 I think he's yeah he's
the one that brought Superman's parents
into the mix okay yeah yeah that would
be nice
no and I think like I think that's what
they're doing with Superman now in
Action Comics is like they took away a
bunch of his powers they got rid of his
you know cape and tights and I think
they're trying to
yeah you change your clothes button if
you want to use it I can just outpace
him that would be best
oh of course yep I'm getting too old for
this shit and already global tornado yes
that is Hulk Hogan dancing on the deck
and it looks like Hulk Hogan has a
little food poisoning and by little we
mean a lot because he's gonna die for it
can't pick you up
this is level like what five yeah yeah
this is level five of the game the boat
party
Briere oh man we got a cheerleader yeah
we got a cheerleader that's fun
nice oh my god I'm feeling sick brother
I'm feeling sick and the only cure is a
20 cc shot of Hulkamania Deano spumoni
that sounds good Johnny says John Burns
Superman was the first and foremost
Clark Kent and always saw himself as
Clark Kent he didn't feel like an
outsider he just saw himself as a man
doing what he can to make me know that I
didn't like that version of Superman yes
that makes sense that's relatable
humanizing by cheerleader I sure did
like watching you shake your pom-poms oh
yeah totally safe you got your
get-out-of-jail-free card and there's
another one on the deck another
get-out-of-jail-free card yeah
which also do you see the Baywatch
lifeguard on the deck man oh and her
little things stayed up there glitch v
games got some pitches yeah I can only
assume that's the twitch integration
really messing stuff up now the caps
frozen yeah yeah I think I can move it
impunity you might be able to yes of
course all your words follow you around
um change clothes that's an all right
question rich what would you recommend
party hard how much we owe where are you
I got beaten up by a wrestler Oh
Oh use it passed out yeah I don't know
who I'm Savin now fucker is that like a
giant what is that purple thing
following him I you know is this
something that popped over his head um
personally it's retaining for like ten
minutes
yeah it's entertaining for like 10
minutes unless you are live-streaming it
in which case you get a little more
juice out of it you know if maybe under
you know it has to be really achieved I
can get it for two bucks yeah I don't
think I have to worry about anything
anymore yeah cuz the cops glitched no it
feels cheap
and being completely honest it feels
cheap it's 13 bucks which yeah 7-7 yeah
not really I guess I hate it I don't
hate it at all no and it's been fun it's
been fun streaming yeah yeah it's been a
it's been a lot of fun streaming it like
I don't think this is anything I would
ever pick up on my own all right let's
see hung useless step copies let's see
how close you can get you yeah you can
get right up there that one smart guys
just sticking right now yeah hey
Brainiac would I support a first person
shooter version of space cop absolutely
first person shooter
that's what space cop is he just shoots
his gun did you want to see space cop in
a space cop game yeah no I want a beast
I mean any first-person game can be like
a Rambo game yeah you know you know you
don't see the character you're playing
as I don't want to see space cop on a be
space captain a licensed game with like
a visual character and the first person
doesn't make sense to me mm-hmm are we
missing
emergent did to kill the merchant maybe
you can see him in 20-minute cutscenes I
like that
yep there you go
it's not all Potter work is he going to
a special spot to dance dance dance
right there in front of the cops I don't
bad about this yeah yeah you should but
