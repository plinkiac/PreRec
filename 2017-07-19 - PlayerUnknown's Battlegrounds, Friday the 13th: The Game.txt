[Part I]
like I'm I'm streaming I say the little
green dot how's everyone doing what's
what's what's the haps I don't know I
know what people say I don't know thinks
again I got this stupid game here I
don't know why I'm gonna give this game
another shot I had a hard time picking a
game to stream out tonight
I was looking for something I could
stream while talking and Friday the 13th
that's so far I've been pretty good for
that I think but now I get it 10 seconds
after I start what's going on
our garden is another important
I played Friday the 13th to death I'm
probably gonna switch to it later anyway
it seems like there's a lot of downtime
in this
so thanks fine fine see what's going on
it's gonna this give this another chance
so 20 minutes of this and then Friday
the 13th at probably probably I wanted
to play the end his knife some more but
everyone in the chat when I brought that
up was like no we hate it we hate the
end of rich we we hate that game you did
the voice for it a few cutscenes lit
today watching it
so like I said I'm playing this because
it seems I don't know a lot a lot of
downtime while you're not really doing
anything or you're running to the next
area and maybe I won't be as intensely
focused on what I need to do I'm dealing
with Jax bindings well now while we're
fine
I'm not using a controller
alright well we can't release the per
shirt we go way too early
Oh God
can I follow my deaf can you do that
will you be willing to fall to your
death
these wonderful buttons by your thumb on
this Mouse and Jack finds everything -
these fucking awkward top buttons
fucking I don't fucking get it I don't I
don't fucking get it I gotta find a gun
and shoot that guy
we'll have armor upstairs
oh that's his shit sure equip I'm not
using a fucking controllers
same fucking face
and don't drop I just
how do I get out of this stupid there we
go
unless I keeps showing me the worthless
console button prompts
got a cool point they'll obviously love
the controller back
what but Mr Mapp now Jack all right we
are in the mission zone where we are
currently in the mission zone
grenade I'll take a grenade
all right
so no no idea what I'm doing but I'm
gonna keep looting shit
Molotov cocktail alright I'm assuming
that kind of shits better to use when
you're working with a team
thank you all right stop adding me
you're covering up my minimap I can't
see what the fuck I'm doing
gosh darn it out all right that that
fucks it my plan to get closer to the
center of the circle
I guess we'll head of here see what the
fuck that is
as the next restriction of the circle is
it always centered
risk running in here someone's been here
it's probably war zone going on in there
you know check out these houses
it's probably like I said like a sea of
vermin in that city
I'm gonna guess whoever's been here has
actually moved on thank you
backpack
oh no I don't want that
give me back my ek yeah why'd you unload
yourself
all right we're heading to the big city
thank you where we will inevitably die
you don't have any kind of body armor
windows gonna play the the Update mag
game there we go now the the update
thing's been around well you just
usually can't hear it
see anybody assuming I'm safe
friendly long stretches without seeing
anything happened in this game tell you
I want to slip machine-gun guess there's
no reason they would all it replaces the
how much it replace the
no no I think I am okay with the aka and
the shotgun which way am I facing where
am I at
I look for car
you know what we'll look for a car
how do you know someone is near by you
I'm being told someone is nearby but I
have no idea how to make that detection
all right well I also have the sound
down on my TV a little bit so it doesn't
pick up on my mic
I have to use heads I don't have
headphones right now
all right
exude this match let's try again try to
good
hit tab does it look like they can hit
tab
No ah fuck
now I gotta reload that's fine
oh it's awful um what is what is this
command that tab is usually bound you
called
hold breath just a normal inventory
button
P cried peak left
weapon title prone title Crouch jump
sprint walk previous weapon reload
targeting Oh
aiming user interface delete marker
he's bandage
their selfie use first aid mm-hmm it's
lying blade sling blades something
people don't reference anymore
slang why'd the fuck is he talking about
all right toggle inventory or does it
just say inventory I'm going with toggle
inventory right all right I'll do that I
think I should use that all the time it
is now bound to something apply or apply
that's not letting me click on apply'
hopefully there's all stuck
okay
okay all right here we go again
nope it did not apply any of my bindings
this looks like a decent spot I don't
see anyone else in the air I don't see
one person so I'm gonna should i murder
him am i right
and he's gonna find a weapon first and
I'm gonna be dead so hurry up and land
you cock number
all right
yeah this inventory button do this quick
okay you have to drag yeah
that that inventory button worked great
I didn't even see guns
I'm not trying to teammate mode one
without jack and second with a group of
strangers especially when I don't know
this game that would just be a horrible
experience with headphones on there's no
game audio for you well alright you know
what if I hear any more bitching we're
going right to Friday the 13th anywhere
bitching
some people get to start with guns or
something
oh wait that's about now cheese question
why isn't the button working right
all right
all right so some action going on in
here somewhere
ha
I'm not doing team games with a bunch of
fucking strangers how much joy at the
game I'm not look if I if I fix the
audio that means I'm not gonna be able
to hear shit in the game ah fuck it
I don't give a shit about this game
anyway can't hear it you need help
fuck it fuck it
Lala in the
what didn't want to do that issues with
one of my buttons here well we are
certainly fucked now
where we're gonna get a better start
there's good by the time I land
everyone's gonna be armed and runnin
around I didn't mean to open my shoot
too soon that wasn't it was an accident
oh don't worry I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna
be good I'm not gonna be done with this
game all night
trying to land in an area with only a
few buildings and denser areas and where
most people go I know but if I do that
I'm I'm not gonna find anybody to shoot
and it's gonna be ultra boring I don't
want it to be ultra boring and I don't
want to avoid the combat because then
you never get better at it
I'm in hell I'm in hell
first I got mics are the worst I mute
everyone going out I want to mute
everyone
absolutely everyone there awful all of
them
all this should be insane
no I have I have the reaction time of a
39 year old man potentially because I'm
a 39 year old man I lie to that balcony
yeah that buttons not working as well as
it needs to that's an important button I
just bought this mouse
all right obviously that button needs to
be changed
all right
I only get to give this I don't know how
many more shots are gonna give this a
lot of sleep why am i running the game
at 7:00 I don't give a shit what the
resolution is on this right now
I didn't even look honestly
we change graphics right now I'm sorry
Oh oh fuck that's wonderful
that rich was done with this guy he's
giving it another shot in the interest
of having something to stream something
that I can talk over
straight fucking down that's what we're
doing
how are these people getting lower than
maybe I was like jump out of plane
straight down as fast as I could I don't
know ma'am
which the helmets didn't look so stupid
and I was a guy in one of these houses
he's probably still around
but where
where is the question
where is my prey
you know what slightly better color shit
all right we need a backpack kind of
want that scope
you know I like the camel camel one
looks nice it was that wait love one
yeah I don't want one more water
I would kill somebody for a backpack so
something I can drop
other guys probably still in the area
right what was that what was that I
heard something
does that scope not let you actually
scope Oh
that's what I want we're in the zone
not saying anyone to shoot I'd like to
kill someone someone else killed one
person
I also like a backpack
can I need a backpack
and I could use like a really cool
helmet
oh no windows you're not restarting I'm
leaving behind armor upgrade I
I don't know what's better
I can't even carry armor upgrades
I think I'm just gonna hang out in this
room for a bit and see if I can spot
anyone
I have a level 2 vest already I thought
I had the level I thought this is a well
fucking we're on back
I was that
oh I thought I had I thought I never on
I just made a mistake
it happens all right dudes I thought
they were both level two and I just like
the one more go prone went on the roof
all right all right
should I hang out here I guess I can
wait all my video game experience I know
we want to close the fucking doors
so so what now
I just I just stay up here until I see
somebody that that sounds fucking boring
I mean it sounds really fucking boring
I'm not I'm not gonna lie to you
squab note is great I don't have squad
they don't want to do it without Jack if
we ever do this again that's the final
fucking word Jack's really enjoying this
and I would be a complete fucking
asshole if I told yo dude squad without
you Jack
oh my god look I'm in an abandoned town
I don't have a backpack I guess I wait
to kill somebody and take theirs that's
the only plan I have all right all right
we'll be patient we'll be patient
that's a functional window yeah
here we got a shots
and definitely hear gunshots
all right I'm not wearing headphones
because when I was wearing headphones
everyone was bitching because they
couldn't hear game audio it is it is
what it is folks
and I don't dare go wandering around
because that other guy who landed in
this town might also be hanging out in a
roof wait this night did I hear that
George Romero died I live under a rock
alright now we got to move on fucking
roof
I wish we don't I gotta go shit
which way is that pointing I can't see
which way all right so kind of behind me
and we do not have a backpack
all right
this is this game is so exciting why am
i giving this a second chance what's
wrong with me I want I want to like a
multiplayer shooter I want to but
multiplayer shooters don't play like
doom and that is why I don't like them
I saw them
they're here somewhere
I did well that was Dulles fuck doing
well means Dulles fuck i sat in a rough
nothing happened
talk about talk about slave 1 no talking
about I'll talk about a little bit by
the Han Solo video I thought of
something app for the fact I predict
that the love interest is going to be a
secret rebel spy who's going to sell Han
Solo out or at least steal his goods to
fund the rebellion and just ditch Han
I'm just gonna use him when that happens
he's gonna say but I love you and she's
gonna say I know dismissively
sniffing you're welcome thank you for
showing up
oh there's some stuff that that didn't
make the cut that predicted the Kessel
run would also go through an asteroid
field
I also predicted that the Millennium
Falcon will have a third radar dish on
top that gets knocked off during the
chase
no I do not have titanfall - I'm gonna
land on the student I don't feel like
installing origin for it
why do people enjoy multiplayer shooters
but why do they enjoy this horseshit I I
barely landed and that guy has a fucking
machine gun how does that shit happen
who do you fall faster
I just want to murder everything and
it's this game so I know I won't
I'm assuming clothing is mostly just
cosmetic I'm assuming
do we miss the ammo for this bound to be
some in here right yeah or not yeah
thank you
you just want to run to a town and see
if we can kill someone that's what I
want maybe I'll shake this I'll check
this first
No
and you drop something
thank you
my fault
yeah now
all right all right now let's go to town
and die in a second that way how far out
of the mission now we're in the mission
zone all right all right I'm not too
worried about the mission zone
and that's probably people up there that
can murder me I'm sure they'd appreciate
my lewd
you believe in me I don't
all right why don't see any loot which I
assume means someone has been here right
been here on left where'd they go
probably over here
I could be anywhere
now I'm gonna go further in London
that's where I came from
but no I don't want a Java update
fucking windows
all right I don't know what the fuck I'm
doing I guess I'm just headed this way
suppose we could follow the main road
for a bit maybe we'll find a car live
fast die hard like I've been dying
pretty easy I don't think you've been
paying much attention to what's going on
here
yeah I want to check these houses I'm
gonna do it because I want to
there's so much better
alright alright they've been here I
don't expect to find much in this scenic
that's nice
we got time we got time
probably long ago looted
but not that one why why level one
I've got a least level one
I suppose they could have went in one of
the other 30 doors in that other house
yeah
alright I'll move on maybe it'll be fun
somewhere up ahead looking for fun
that's what I'm looting for I'm looting
for fun
that's bombing going AAB there
probably dangerous at this point to head
towards that city right
my other peek but is not working
yeah we're gonna crouch up and head
towards these houses hopefully there'll
be some fun in there
what's the difference between that what
I have none are the same
can I'll take anymore all right it's my
backpack full
yeah I need a bigger backpack I get it
oh I was treating play area area you
know the play area is restricted it's a
restricted play area
there was drinking the play area
you had to crawl like this look I I'm I
got a minute to get there
the killer blue was on its way
killer blue does not want me to have any
fun
yeah I'm coming back with this game only
because I'm worried i streamed Friday
the 13th too much though it's inevitable
I'm gonna end up playing it before the
night is through
fuck this
no that's not in the mission zone we
don't want to have that way
okay
ooh what's this ooh what's this
Oh
the focus that
windows
fuck this game fuck this game
ah yeah I want to exit this match by
exit this match I mean immediately
ah fuck that fuck that's so much fuck
that so hard
fuck that till it dies fuck everything
about that how does it feel to be forced
to run out because of the declining
circle to get sniped by the guy who was
in the middle of the circle from the
start of the game how's that feel how's
that feel and you think that fuck it
feels

[Part II]
now at that button
I know dooms not hot garbage but I can't
talk and play doom at the same time I
just can't do it all right then we go me
make sure I'm mom push-to-talk
there one yeah we just go to decent
servers oh hey I don't don't like delude
yourself eventually it's gonna crash hey
trust me we're we're all gonna get
booted out and also if there ends up in
a lot of people that leave so if there's
only like that - um tell us the story of
first meeting we had our class together
in high school it's it's not a super
exciting story
my voice is my voice is always too high
you know there's a volume knob on here
I'll turn myself down a little bit you
know there's a volume knob on the stream
there's like a little thing or you can
tell the stream if I'm too loud and the
chest and the game is too loud
yes you just turn the sound down and
twitch no your fucking voice is too
fucking no apparently I was last playing
is this dude
I'll see what we can find keys gasp is
there a boat all this motorboat so we
can look for a pillar probably won't be
near here though best thing we can find
his keys nothing's more frustrating than
getting the car ready to go and nobody
can find keys why would you ever want to
sweet some another fucking another these
guys are communicating I'm going to
presume they're competent I'm a surgeon
tiny house
I'm way down at spring water this guy
has named a gun at me I'm nervous wall
them step Jason that's a great day mo
you got a press on press on keys
I don't sprint around like that you'll
hear you absolutely nothing and why did
you stop working
take your goon back
what to do I can't believe we didn't
find anything for the damn car here all
the deaths in this cabin Jesus kill
Jason yes that easy you need a good
group it's not even worth thinking about
if you not have a good group and I got
to remember this guy don't say oh yeah
that's right okay alright this house is
virgin territory
well I found where the fuse goes I don't
have the fuse
all right we got gas that's good
I could run it right to the car but
probably smarter to check the rest of
this house first god damn it I don't
even have anything I didn't know where
the traps were I could be a selfish
fucking prick you have to come to camp
crystal fuck I can barely do that
they're already going for the boat all
right I can't see my hood I probably was
gonna steal the note but it looks like
they're already heading towards all this
gas later everyone oh they totally found
that gas alright we're bringing this to
the car then I have no fucking clue
where the battery is or the keys this is
currently our only realistic hope
oh they got the battery I don't even
notice that I've got the gas I'm heading
towards the car please I just wanted to
study chemistry so that I skated
yes without of your words
oh this this is not a complicated
stretch of road you should not be having
problems with the stretch of road Oh
wish I had a melee weapon
oh god it's nice to be having fun while
playing a game you can joke this easy
you can't I have no weapon I can't help
I'll let you go buddy yeah I couldn't
find anything I found a flare this is
the little boar that I want keep
swinging at me swing it at me
oh I'm out of here
and I want to abandon them
all right I'm back it's Tommy you back
up for him I'm gonna let you go
you're gonna fuck him you get a fucking
bowl you're gonna fuck him shut the fuck
up you tried to save them I can't have a
minimap
I need a map or anything to defend with
ah that's terrible that was terrible
poor bread do you guys still see me
driving good no that was that was
terrible Richards don't give me Sh which
Evans went back for that person almost
made it Tommy salami here being summoned
in just to die again
I'm sorry I failed you with the car no
worries
it's my favorite trail in the park the
one with all the dead people which is so
quiet he usually is what do you people
want what do you people want I don't
think he cares
that's weird that wants to tell I have
no real tales to tell when I got here
with the tips I just got one what's say
you says that's right all the great
entertainment from prereq and rlm over
the years question what game would you
really like to play right now can I
request you play it thanks yeah that's
what I'm doing
when in a game I enjoy this person dies
soon enough for crying out loud
I'll tell you secrets about Jack now
there I have no secrets about Jack
well it something about games I'm not
playing to develop if I enjoy a game I'm
probably currently playing it to death
that's the nature of a game you enjoy
holy shit I certainly was not enjoying
hey it's me I'm pudgy
I'll treat with the proper respect it
deserves I'm sad that you didn't catch
the Big Trouble in Little China
reference I made about Jack paying his
dues in my resub message sorry sorry we
all will miss something here and there
rich what what is it you think that
makes Friday the 13th different as a
multiplayer game from the game like pub
G I'm a four-time a 39 year old man with
39 year old man reflexes that's part of
it and you know damn well ed that my
last death there in pubs you was just
bullshit utter bullshit I'm running from
the circle that's gonna kill me and the
guy who was already safe and snug in the
safe area gets to snipe me from a roof
or something I think we all know that is
bullshit
it's who gets the drop on who that's not
fun I want a good battle I don't want to
whoop say first you're dead fuck that
this rate he's gonna survive just by not
seeing JB's more fun in a group sure but
I don't have a good to play with right
now come on to the object
it's the same gameplay you can just form
squads with friends as I don't play very
many multiplayer games
I tied like they don't have very many
friends for what it deserves I'm still
enjoying this game too I'm fine with
Friday the 13th you son of a bitch and
I'm look at you everywhere
I'm gonna fucking name here are you were
supposed to meet at the Pavilion
it looks kind of ugly I know
well the enterprise-d it whatever thank
God
nothing on the roof it enterprise /a
which another some minor differences you
know but it's got some nice smooth lines
oh you
mr. are you put some face
as the game banter surveys you asshole
everywhere you're gonna miss it when
somewhere vital team tug is still going
on I'll tell you what will change I'll
change Labadee sure he found like half
the server's dead bodies before I found
I should not have stopped at Taco Bell
after they call I thought ahead to I'm
in one of these movies usually like an
hour and a half it's not a terrible
group it's better than no communication
at all but we're finding something
different
nobody's talking to her at all Hansen I
get rich Evans
oh yes that that would be me hello
I've got your stream out on the
background I've been trying to get you
randomly well excellent then you can you
can stream snipe me this is great holy
shit that is rich Evans
you
now if only I can get recognized by a
billionaire who wants to put me in their
will
oh nice they are here Jason find them
always phone phone first
yes that's a far walk we'll take out the
power
all right turn push-to-talk off
temporarily
oh good combo somebody's probably gonna
get out in the boat
and yeah I think will try and kill you
why not oh I think going for a kill with
rich Evans
they deserve to die Jason make them
suffer
there's a goop
yeah it's obvious
back to my boy hunt them down and make
them pay
hello swingarm thought I saw this house
red nope
Jason is this part six yo what's up go
run away do you want an autograph
car Oh a jerk jerk that's rude kind of
look I can't stay you know I'm gonna
have to kill you now you can you were
mean to me now go get some tough guy
gotcha we glitched are you Hannah oh
okay how the hell does that happen
that was weird
where would they be
doesn't work when you already stunned
wasted firecracker
there
totally give me the runaround
all right
you cannot die
you can never die
they want to hurt you Jason don't let
them know this counselor has all the
pocket knives that's what they have
don't stop Jason they deserve to die
make them suffer like we need
don't stop Jason they deserve to die
make them suffer like we did
not
keep you from me Jason don't let them
come on come on nigga they deserve to
die Jason make them suffer they want to
hurt you Jason don't let them
that's where you find that door they
know nope three up second-story window
but you know door bashing Trump's that
why break the windows because when the
win when the counselors climb out a
window that's been broken they take a
little bit of damage
might be a little bit hard to be I have
not been taking out enough generators
that's the radio which I'm gonna take
out now that doesn't annoy me later
I know my microphones on I don't have to
worry about my chatter with you annoying
councillors doing team work when I'm
playing is Jason
gotcha
end up with a good burning as I always
say yeah beautiful mother the game I
almost took too much damn time you hope
they didn't let me win no they didn't
let me win as some would decently played
someone might have gotten out on the
boat I wasn't wasn't doing much to check
on the boat but
I did not mean that as a backhanded
compliment I just talked weird
Oh God were playing with Kermit
I think that karma caught him actually
call himself Kermit the Frog though
there's a guy I played with once might
have been on a stream who played in
character as Kermit the Frog give a
shout-out to my number one fan in
Germany shoutouts to my number one fan
in Germany
you're the guy who originally voiced
Kermit was a huge dick that guy was Jim
Henson I suppose could have been a huge
dick but he's not just that guy who
first voiced Kermit
yeah Fred's done she says
was that reapplying as this guy doesn't
really mean to do that I'm not playing
with any kind of group I know I should
switch to Deborah or AJ it's a 25%
chance the phone is this house and I'm
already fucked
it's not
good hopefully he morphs to the car and
I can get away with this
nothing bastard
bye-bye
maybe I'll be Tommy alright alright
that's fair
oh hey what about that
did anyone else get awake where's the
dumble the other car all right
that summer I didn't go for the kill you
cannot prematurely go for the kill
you don't even think about it until the
mask is off if you're not playing with a
group dedicated to doing it working
together
why is this of sluggish
I think turtle
this guy's already got three kills
hmm
I'll tell you what we're just gonna help
everyone else uh we're gonna do some
damage to this guy this mask comes off
we'll see what happens
sweaters on the island though that's not
a good sign
that was the most clever bear trap
placement ever and you call that lucky
for shame sir for shame
we cannot stay in a match with a group
tonight Burke do we go grinder
gobbledygook says dance your care
dance your cares away worry's for
another day let the music play down a

that real
it's Jeff be real
northeastern Higgins
parking - take that
our kitchen check it out Jack I hear you
come to Papa
you want a player to come back as the
Jason from part five instead of Tommy
why it wouldn't make any sense for him
to help out counselors unless you want
him to come back and help out Jason for
some reason always forgets about that
drawer alright this is pretty well
searched nope dumbass

that a dead body we're gonna check these
drawers first though because finding
keys is awesome very important
does anybody have keys
it's fine it's fine it's fine
lady did a fair deal of the machete
damage to me that's not good
battery was there somebody founded but
that's the battery for shit
alright I'll take that ride
it is on the road
let's go
I think hey do you know how to
deactivate these traps right here
oh you need a nice what do you do when
you get a nice
hey what the hell
I'm not bad not bad
I just say we go to the cops
unless you got key
I'm not gonna feel too bad about this I
did put gas in the car
it's
two-seater she won't fit outdoors very
noble very noble hold on hold on
what's going on
I'm good enough good luck
like that
a port
oh well oh well it was a fine match it
was a fine match
Oh No
I gotta find the others for the cops
be sure they're only
I guess it works out after all right
who's left just you just yes I've been
shat out fit I never seen that one
before
Oh thinking we're just thinking about no
I wasn't thinking about shooting him
that was just a dumb accident
you didn't might not have known any
better why was he able to come back cuz
uh once you call once you use the radio
to call in Tommy Jarvis a random person
who was either died or escaped gets to
come back as Tommy and just by a fluke
it was me two games in a row
wow what a mega biotic frog says these
pretzels are making me thirsty I'm sorry
and he was blocking flares to using I'm
sorry he still can't kill people so he
quits
that was weak why not apply the same
logic with fake Jason then one player
can get to come back as Tommy and
another can come back is fake Jason you
make the game too hard this is a weird
balance as it is if you have two jason's
it's just stupid
well I'd be ok with part 5 is adjacent
skin but you don't want to Jason's
running around the map that's that's
that's insane
if I seen the disaster artist trailer I
have maybe good it might be good from
everything I've heard about God I'm
drawing a blank on what's the fucking
name what's this fucking name fucking
Harry Osborn I can't remember his damn
name drawn blank help me out chap Franco
for everything I heard about how amazing
his tummy was I can't help but think he
was a little bit underwhelming in that
teaser trailer but the movie still looks
like it will probably be good
I gotta get out of here
No all right I don't place this guy
normally I don't feel like I'm doing
that bad
we're fast we can get this installed
before JC shows up
hope I'm doing this right
I'm gonna pull a trick I learned a while
ago I'm gonna leave this bat by the car
I got keys just big-ass cool cool
so the odds are someone missed it right
90% of the time it's in the same area as
the car
are they hanging out there because they
have it are they putting it in no no
they're rocking away
I have a guess good I missed it do you
want to put it in so Jason doesn't go
that's you late for that
ah now we're go that's that's that's he
bought the cap do you see that
towards a fuse box that don't have a med
spray
okay so how do you disarm a a trap from
Jason if you have a pop you need to have
a pocket knives you get about yeah you
gotta just just just catch down
all right sorry we got like a few
seconds to get this done
there Connie thanks to the spray let's
go
over here but not here
actually what you'll have to back up you
can actually get around the houses and
go through down by the cemetery
you can go yeah
nice good job no problem no problem good
work everyone
and he rage quits Wow that's like a
third he blocked the trap and we still
escapes to park nice to cocksucker
ah keeps kicking me on when I get a good
group that's so annoying
like to stick around have a second and
third match with some of these people as
a cramp
you fix that yep that's alright
everybody pretty good with some good
matches here I like this I like this
I've died a couple times but each time I
got out his tummy but a pretty good
night
capes one I know you're trying to troll
me you're starting to starting to annoy
me though too slow for folks trying to
ruin my mood I'm having a good night I'm
having fun
I'm playing a game I like I might let
you shit on that man if you think you're
being funny but a little bit irritating
so I'm not good enough for your leap
game
pack a knife good
Matt but I don't see a motor boat motor
votes the best way to get out on this
map
then I need a map just in a word spawned
Jessie needs a hook that'll let him
stall the car it's it's way too easy for
Jason to stall the car as it is I hate
to let this information slip out but if
you're playing this Jason and you want
to stop somebody from escaping in the
car 90 percent of the time they'll take
the main road they won't try and
off-road it if they don't have to
including me if I don't think I have to
off-road it I probably won't except
maybe on this map you you teleport ahead
to where you know they're going a good
distance ahead go is the important part
you go into stock and then you shift
into them as they're driving towards you
you're in stock they don't hear the
music they don't know to try and swerve
you don't you don't want to try and
morph right on top of them that that
almost certainly won't work so more much
further down the main road that you know
they're heading down stock and then
shift into them as they're heading
towards you those are the car strats
yeah I knew they missed it the purlins I
knew it I'm gonna leave that here free
XP now we know what the propeller is we
need to find gas we can get out on the
boat and fuck everyone else
protip if you don't want someone
stealing your boat don't fix the damn
propeller alright maybe I'll try and
invite some people after this round it's
a little bit late right now if I
considered using some same trap strats
the ones I try are all mad what was the
point if you're not going mad man you
gotta have fun you gotta have the mad
trance Tourette's
I saw gas in here once
it's Jack's vacation not going great I
wish him the best but man two dogs and
two kids oh boy
I don't envy him
company search up here
she uses it with very at the
intersection at midnight it's like
they've got the battery in
anybody have car keys anyone with the
mic gonna head over here we're gonna see
what happens
let's see what happens over here I'm
gonna guess somebody took the gas that
spawn near the boat kind of for the boat
and brought it over towards the car yes
there are now two gas cans over in this
direction
I don't that left gasps buying a car I
might run off with it
you guys find keys nope
do we have gas they don't have keys
they don't have keys Hey they don't have
keys I should take it I should take it I
know what to do with it I should take it
you guys find anything these three
people around here anybody find anything
I will do something you're all just
fucking stand there with thumbs up here
here always
gasps is in now we just need keys
so I fucking killed myself what happened
we still might find another can of gas
over here which I still think is my best
way out come by the car immediately I
have keys
if you shoot them in first feet it's a
nice attempt
she's dead already hey deadly tacos why
just stand there with a shot kind of
watch that person get killed did you
want to take his keys is that it
good aim for the feet but to be fair
there's a high chance it would have just
killed me yeah
would it kill you either was that cotton
spreads bullets I mean people were just
standing there the whole time
watching people get killed better tried
something right so what am I gonna try
you couldn't in the melee save your
teammates at the car
there wasn't any around
well we're looking for gas and battery
so
chart is a great player like him tonight
just trash every Jason I played against
this quit to be fair I didn't kind of
kind of hide the compeller rather than
installing it so push came to shove I
did the right thing by the car and I got
you killed yes but I feel good about
myself
obviously in real life I wouldn't feel
good about myself I'd just be dead but
now come home
again thank you good game to YouTube
I'll leave the salami all right I am
gonna make a quick restroom trip if you
are one of my steam friends and you want
to play this game with me
enter the game right now so when I go to
invite people I will see that you are
playing this game okay I'll be back
shortly
all right let's see what we can do
it's actually need to party oh I've got
to get myself an online mode how do you
how do you do that well there we are
right the party all right you go commit
see and you sort this by game that's
weird
huh so is player unknown battlegrounds
just like super fucking popular an
esteemed friends are playing that 301
that's the way yeah well one it's fine
how we doing
not enough for a private match so we're
just gonna go into normal old public
matches
a steam name is charred CH ard
1:56 our traps gay my friend reads heard
likes traps I'm trying to tell them
they're gay hey guys how's it going good
you're saying the traps like other traps
of the same gender he like he strapped
just told me he likes men but he also
wants to know if traps are gay we
already know he's gay
okay yeah so like if you see research
you probably if you think it's gay just
hit him to death I'm in escape : he say
he's gonna kill me because he's kind of
nervous
we're gonna Jason from your life alright
here we are here we are
got a feeling were largely on our own
I'm so busy I rolling I missed what map
we're on I'm assuming this is packing AK
all right I don't think I've missed
anything their boat just carb somebody's
dead already
that's like that
I think we're gonna head north
there's no boat which usually means
nothing too interesting is gonna spawn
south
now I don't want to check the big house
and you're installing it with a low
repair stat so I'm gonna stay away from
you he's going after Carl wisely look at
all these fucking doors Big Love wide
open so we can't have nice things
that's a shitty one them as a crap lock
anyway
he found the battery fuck is this taking
this at the other car
yes for taking this to the other car
they already got I don't have a walkie
otherwise have a radio this in
that's that dick he's probably got the
keys
we can head that way if you want
let the heat die down mixing and it's
too late for you to spawn in as Tommy
somebody else already is
alright alright
so we're gonna be trapped here doing
that crap this car just don't understand
some Jason's it's gonna don't have a
radio
so I cannot communicate with anybody
who's not with an earshot that we just
need the keys this person might have
them no no they do not
hello hey what's up you made it
um no I think we're all out for now you
never have a seat put a microphone in
your face I don't know I can't help you
there all right
I just waiting there for someone else to
come by the keys or someone else to come
save them
mixing did you have keys when you died
by chance
where's your Shack Jason well it's East
the Shack is East yeah it's it's
Pamela's voice and says they're trying
to hurt us juice and stop them city
golly it's the hint that you need to get
your ass in gear down there uh work
there should be lights to the right
don't teleport there it might startle
and make them you I don't think there's
anything down there before you leave
check wait we need to knock your mask
off first let's just get that out of the
way
oh they they're doing a kill wait hold
on we don't have the right weapon to
even kill him so we need to go get a
machete how boring
I'm just gonna keep looking for keys or
something
a fuse I don't know J sorry
I look at this exciting game where the
players and Jason are collaborating so
that Jason can lose riveting okay take
the mask
all right Jarvis will you add Jarvis
we got his mask off where's the house
well that person had the fucking keys
wait hey pull over car stop hey you with
the sweater don't leave yet stun him
all right Jarvis don't wait on Jarvis
take this weapon yep shoving your face
quick hit him with the machete all right
however you want to do this you can read
things that are going on hey go go the
front seat I want to test something test
something let's see what we got just
something
hi Karen hi
my fiancee is a murder machine I knew
that
right
got the car
punch back check
check-check when that Blanca
sort things what sort of things you're
talking about I see jack
oh you an icon yeah
yeah we're doing Jarvis it's beautiful
right now
they can't hear either
service wedding where you go either of
us Sam to get out of here
I happen I don't know someone who
teleported away and ended their ass
literally the entire unit charter sorry
didn't say anything early I was having
trouble with my mic am i quiet because I
talk to quieter my quiet cuz the
microphone isn't up in my grill I can
probably fix that they said they can't
hear me can you hear me now do we need
to turn me up
totally finding a different lobby those
guys sucked is this loud enough if I try
to like slightly shout until I forget to
do it you got turn me up I'm too quiet
okay now let's say they can hear me take
it a little bit away from my face yeah
good it's kind of up in my little to
live not well you know this isn't to
Goldilocks and the three bears
well that mixing and clipping what's
that mean that I'm talking too loud or
something the sediment riches levels now
do I think meditation for
self-improvement help sirs at full of
crap do we all need to be improved I
if meditation makes you feel better
that's good I don't know if it in and of
itself it is guaranteed to make you a
better person on the other hand if
you're the kind of person who wants to
try to be a better person you're
probably a decent person begin with
so how's everything ya need a good time
today we went to some they're sick this
whole like kind of weird little yuppie
gentrified section awawa toasted that I
didn't know about and we went to a cafe
there and it was good a sandwich and
some fries
you'd probably like it reasonably well
are they sending your clipping stone
they're saying I'm too loud I don't know
if you turned me up to eleven or cuz I'm
not generally super loud talker and the
microphone is you know I have people
blowjob I'm flowing into the mic
alright right now it's about I don't
know about the length of my hand and
then some away which is like not exactly
right on top of me
thank you from you Jason don't let them
yeah you know I will trap the car first
we'll be back
have you been playing this game the
whole time most of it I tried another
day that sucked
oh and so so Stockton with a girl that I
was hanging with today we decided that
in movies like you know where people
swear is it does they like you know
those like say Apple or something
instead they want to be stupid they
should just add the names of Wisconsin
cities you know like what the
Kinnickinnic are you doing this thing on
put that thing the Wauwatosa down not
that you know other states don't have
some good weird sounding names like
Kalamazoo or can't get key you're
unbelievably sweet am i replacing rich
Evans no one can replace rich Evans
yeah Walla Walla no those are weird and
and Waco Texas
it's like whacko
sneaking this Milwaukee snake and this
will walk you plane exactly Mississippi
you submission yeah ham little deal for
mother like it's full of glitches what
are those red things people
oh you've seen the people through the
building called Edwards the Yellowknife
kill it
can you play as Jason's moment no I said
I should play what's it like to be with
rich when fans recognizing it's cute its
fans are nice people this weekend so we
were in another time the time before
that want somebody recognizing where to
add a little bookstore and there's this
girl so you're playing is that random or
do I just take this guy forever
walk up oh that's pretty seriously
central advisory go push it off a minute
they deserve to die make them suffer
like what happened culprit to kill those
people these kind of games read ones
from today I read some of them I don't
know which ones you read so there was
one thinks for from what's say you
thanks for all the great entertainment
in prereq and rlm over the years
question what game would you really like
to play right now and can I request you
play where the links okay then
gobbledygook said dance your cares away
worry's for another day let the music
play down at Fraggle Rock read that one
okay how about surfing the top and work
down nigga Bionic frog these pretzels
are making me thirsty
I suggest drinking something
gobbledygook says it's a rare condition
to stay and age to read any good news on
the newspaper
did I do that which papers they died
Jason he said maker ambitious an age to
read any good news on the newspaper page
that's something I know I don't know one
they want you to do an Urkel impression
I don't have one
um I could do it does a decent permit
they say that you've been break down
doors faster by hitting them well in
combat yeah that's a that's a cheap
tactic I don't want to do that it was in
family matters which was family matters
the fat black cop
was it her whole no family matters is
that which one with that well who wasn't
what what's the deal with him I'm
killing people whose family members I
think they're saying that the theme song
was family members know trying to make
show Family Matters was I don't know
one of them
do the wheel of premarital sex grow up
in this game Jason no because they do
have the sleeping make him suffer like
we did was it the one with Bill Cosby
that show was always just a little too
goody-goody for me but then man I really
suck at this game it's okay
I don't think rich has any good
impressions except for rich it's good
impressions of rich Allen's is your name
satellizer satellite wait your name
sanitizer or salt Eliezer I seem to
recall murdering you I didn't think I
was that bad
that I'm talking that's some idiot well
hopefully hopefully this time I can
actually do something that matters
nothing really matters anyone can see
what's jad saying this thing you do a
decent George Lucas impression
everyone's gonna live cuz I I'm so bad
at the pop culture stuff I need to go to
like rich Evans remedial pop culture
school stop apologising we all start
somewhere
dope dopamine I kind of like that name
Papa's say that very kind of you sir
pop the Smurfs are like the opposite of
a harem they're like a harem in Reverse
there's like one female and they're all
males yeah
I gotta get out of here I gotta get out
of here anyone you have to come to camp
Crystal Lake we got going they got a
radio a lot of these horror movie it
just wouldn't work as well with cell
phones you know they call the police and
ten minutes later the police would show
up and they might be dead by then
but it definitely wouldn't last hours
there insects murph edges their queen
buddy guess is any I always kind of
wondered if they didn't just kind of pop
out of the mushrooms like spores
so
tofu eating zombies so you bought a CB
radio and then you went on it and there
was like nobody to talk to that's really
sad
what's written like CB radios and ham
radios is like a different frequency or
something no idea need to look this up
sometime
how long have rich and I have been
together more than 15 years more than 16
years oh well I think when it's powered
by ham you get a generic one is like a
spam radio I couldn't hear what he said
what's that I see you found the car keys
I haven't found anything yet but I'm
still looking
Oh Thank You tomato Ned
well that Barbie game was spawned
seriously we gotta have your sister back
up here again and play some kind of some
game I don't know what game maybe like
mall madness or something or is there
like an obnoxiously stereotypically
he-man little boy game where you like
fish and Whittle when and hunt and try
not to pleasure yourself or whatever
little boys do it's summer camp I've
actually never played them
there's nothing wrong with fishing
there's nothing wrong with the prom or
joining the fan club whatever the things
were in the Barbie game it's just I'm
trying to think of what is like the most
stereotypically preteen boy thing to do
it doesn't mean that only preteen boys
fish
it's that like somebody's something
control
did you die yeah yeah buzz I'm sorry
what
can you hang people on those hope coat
hooks because they look like they're
just begging for somebody to be only
reason they're there can you hook can
you hang people on the deer statue thing
the deer head in the wall you do impale
them on I know my people hey that guy
didn't make us bad or girl some very
gender-neutral
why won't you fucking why won't you
connect mukbang his doors are really
wide I'm glad they're all handicapped
accessible that those woods aren't only
gonna be big enough for Jason to fit
through
stretcher I'm sorry Jason violence this
is the kind of movie that gives a
certain certain subclass of parents
nightmares yeah my mother oh god yeah
your mother would love the shit out of
this yeah your mother's your mother's
regret in life was that you didn't watch
enough horror movies with her she drove
me away from them I think I watched a
couple weather and the worst and
cheesier they were the more she liked
them oh ya know when I was gonna young
little small like Friday the 13th that
be a family movie oh yeah
your mom was cute
she really was I like that you know what
happened to that the VHS of your mother
and your brothers doing it doing a home
movie version of The Exorcist I don't
know where that is I can't find it I
can't find it
that was sweet yeah yeah
first her arms is in her head it's only
a flesh wound at some point it just got
lost in the shuffle with moves it's
something I don't know you got to find
that you got to find the one where your
parents are on their wedding day and
your dad's going I've waited for man of
course ma'am you know I mean yeah yeah I
being 20/20 we know that that their
marriage didn't last but they were so
young and so yet they did I remember
when went before your mom passed that
one time there were your grandmother's
pulling there swimming around and they
were yeah
I mean they both fit that's not where we
married that kids know anything else but
yeah they weren't better about it it
just didn't work out you curious went
out with my parents I was an infant I
don't know yeah I mean he was for my
entire life of memories for as long as I
can remember they weren't a couple
yeah I mean I think she and Terry were
probably married before your brother was
born and your brothers are all named
names your brother's like a couple years
younger than you sir you were a tiny
child because you don't remember when he
was born
here's what three vaguely remember when
my oldest sister was born it she's maybe
yeah yeah they're living apart I don't
really I don't really remember when he
deformed oh yeah
so my point is I mean your parents will
you know probably two years for a year
or two before that their parents so yeah
there's no way you were just too little
I told you what the first thing I
remember is the first thing I remember
clearly about that about the birthday
party yeah huge story you tell one of
you want the first thing I remember
clearly memory that's got any kind of
detailing is any kind of narrative to it
it was my third birthday and I was
wearing like he was Raggedy Ann on the
dress and it was white dress with red
and blue stripes and my uncle was he's
about 20 years older than me a little
bit less young man and he was a smartass
and still is and he looked at me and he
looked at my dress and he said is that
your birthday suit and I looked at him
and I said yeah I guess I mean I was I
was either did just turn 3 it was a
power 33 and he started laughing and I
looked at my mother like why is he
laughing at me and she's like your
birthday suit means you're naked cuz I
had no idea
mm-hmm so that was my introduction to
ponds and a wordplay because you know at
3 I was just starting to be old enough
to start to understand that words could
have more than one meaning
yeah yeah don't give the jerk any more
attention than he wants oh I think he
wants more giving him more than any
morning needs yeah give him more than he
wants me there may be no limits no my
watch is gonna die it wants me to plug
it back in it's just gonna have to wait
so you're dead you just have to watch
other people do stuff yep
doesn't make it only that can that's why
I lot of people leave you can see right
through those planks that's a very
sturdy construction I'm sorry
it's a rickety wooden cabin I hope it
doesn't get too cold over Camp Crystal
Lake help there mosquitoes don't have a
Zika virus hey I don't need the blood
yesterday and they made me sign
permission to test it for the Zika virus
permission yeah like you signed all

who tipped him off
who tipped him off and ruin what would
have been an amazing steam asturias
dream moment is this a school night
no it's following summer who tipped him
off this is mom let him play this game
it's so violent who tipped him the fuck
off yes this just gets stitches exactly
are they owning up to it you know I'm
not sure because they're all I can't
tell his viewers it probably would have
been great
his viewers what's that mean yeah I
don't know if I mean maybe maybe late
puberty or something but he sounds like
he's like like 9 yeah yeah I don't know
they didn't have if they had video games
this violent when we were kids like it
was like 4 pixel things I think it might
be a little bit creepy to me I mean
spares probably don't know but if my 10
year old was playing an incredibly
violent video game with a bunch of 40
year old men yeah the kid was cute
no fishing for underage boys was okay I
said that fishing was okay for underage
boys what didn't you get on fishing well
I was we're saying okay see they have
the Barbie game and it was like all the
stereotypical things okay going to prom
getting boyfriends and going up so I was
just wondering what the male equivalent
would be for like you know it's
picturing like a Boy Scout game or
something where they all like what do
you do I don't learn how to fish and and
two bows and arrows free adolescent boy
you do not have faster only must mashing
from full head Lawrence once we've
beaten the channel made it known they
were screaming at his channel a circle
started frowny face I really wanted to
see a hit and that's not a good
stereotypical 50s
summer camp a frat boy game where can a
frat boy Ken game were you learn to do
be wrong beer pong yeah baby
somebody said the high school boy is
being every swearing would just say
master days
I don't know I don't know if the XP from
surviving this worth waiting for
everyone else to buy dreads
yeah I think we're getting out of here
I like a punk rock up checks and the
dude strikes
yep
you can set bear traps for people come
on bro I thought we were cool I thought
we were cool you i I can't exit out of
this without disbanding the party oh the
kids life you go on perfectly normally
and if he wasn't already gonna be a
serial killer or something he won't be I
don't think I was he's being harmed by
this game I just think it's if I were a
parent I would think it was slightly
disturbing that my son was playing video
games I was I don't care if there's a
kid playing this game as long as we're
not being a dick it was a two-seater on
the host okay right oh well I added even
such mom on fire like I wanted her to
put the battery in the four seater but
she didn't cuz I didn't know the
two-seater already had gas it's
employment blame it on the person that
put gasses and Gigi's he's kind of
adorable East Coast accent Mindy can't
Santa though we're fought our love me
some Higgins
ah you know what you're not blaming me
for being a nice guy to put the gap I
want to play another game with that guy
I want to find him even if I'm not going
to be able to select the map I want up
greener pastures I had um I had a weird
match you just came crawling back
walling back okay we're gonna try again
like the Wesley webbed you are yeah yeah
I had matched a couple nights ago I was
playing with somebody they spoke German
and like not not very much English and I
I know like just a very very very bare
amount of German and we had to work
together I I have a key I'm like a have
a gasps yeah - lhasa i think that's a
key we got out makes lawful is key in
german i forget that we managed we've
managed to work together it was kind of
great - mish lhasa room key
Slough saw was a schlissel slaw so
swiftly cabbage streusel sounds about
right
schnitzel now smashing it so sniffles
like some kind of meat how does rich
know any German high school that was
never any good at it
why did you take it I don't know I don't
remember
I probably just heard good things about
mr. Schmidt oh he missed he was fun yeah
that was probably it cuz it was that or
is that her Spanish but like the two
options right you had to take a for edge
that it would have been more useful I
kind of regret that yeah inside that day
class was the teacher was home how fluid
is Mike in German I don't know if Mike
speaks any German at all
this tournament was schmitter Spanish
with Sanchez what was her last name I
can't even remember oh I don't but
Spanish teacher was perfectly nice lady

the link is my boat listen to me this is
my boat not yours it's everyone's job
boneless just tweet tweet jack about it

or something right
Sunday I won't be able to do much I
don't know a lot of people happy weren't
here earlier I won't be able to stream
on Sunday we're filming a episode of
best of the worst but I'm probably gonna
make it up Saturday or Monday would you
be able to stream with me Saturday or
Monday or process this weekend actually
I'm heading down oh yeah yeah all right
all right
well so Monday well Sunday I'm
definitely gonna have to be down there
Sunday because I tell you that Melanie
and I are going to a Roger Waters
concert no this is the first I've heard
about I went when was this a thing whoa

apparently not
not that I got anything it's Roger I
operated on you Bruce sir I no idea if
it'll be good or bad or indifferent but
oh yes she and I are gonna go see it
because she mentioned it to me a few
weeks back and I thought I had to work
but now my schedules changed so so yeah
that's Sunday how do I know what room
key is in German I took it in high
school too
yeah although not with rich we both took
it separately we we have very few
classes together in high school we had
gym class sophomore area that's where I
met you but mostly our social circles
overlaps but we
really we didn't be classes we didn't
really get to know each other in high
school right right we got along oh yeah
and we you know did hang out color yeah
I heard David Gilmour too but uh you
know she said doesn't matter if I'm
talking in town I wanted to know phone
doesn't matter if I'm in the middle of a
sentence or at the end of a sentence or
at the beginning of a son's not to you
well who's what they should round this
room and it might be but isn't what's
simmer simmer of was room or something I
don't know like that was one of the
words like cuz it was like hotel room
key from our book so it was all kind of
like what if you visit kind of
vocabulary a lot of stuff about like
traveler's checks which is funny because
I mean when's the last time you don't
with a traveler's check I guess
not finding any other things I need to
find I don't know my favorite phrase in
German D cutoff was that I seat like a
house because it sounds threatening but
it's just about potato salad I don't
even I don't even have a map
you don't have a map
the cars over here I thought it would
have found the battery or the gas by now
something called Oh found something men
l gobbledygook says rich do you think
Jabba the Hutt will be in the upcoming
Han Solo yes I'd be shocked if he isn't
you know when they made the new ones and
they did that other thing they they
totally ruined him because he's supposed
to be just like to me and he's supposed
to be just so
so rotund and and weird and gross and
like a giant poop and he can't move hmm
what percentage will he be
computer-generated versus actual 100
yeah probably
will you please buy all my old job a
toys No
oh it's damn cold yeah I keep saying
decoy taught us a lot and it's dark at
office Mladic I keep forgetting what sex
potatoes are our potatoes sit with sex
ale it is that's something that is I I
know it exists in most languages but in
English it's just the and it's always
hard for English speakers to wrap their
head around the idea that words have
gender and they're not even always like
the same gender in every language like
the moon in the Sun are male and female
in both German and French but they're
flipped as far as wishes which all right
car has gas there's a battery sitting
near the car but it's trapped and we
need keys on Jason's here when did we
start dating we know each other for a
while before we admitted to ourselves
that we were romantic way I know I liked
you for ages before you did
yeah I tonal languages is another thing
that I is it is potato feminine D
kartoffel but a lot nobody have keys
does anybody yes rich escaped the friend
zone what did it what pushed you over
the edge
what made you desperate enough I don't
know we're watching like didn't watch
the movies but it just happened like
then no I don't know before that it's
hard to say it's been a while all right
father I got lucky you don't even know
yeah anything I say right now is gonna
get twisted and don't even know exactly
what moment they decided I liked you
romantically you know I don't remember
English words are neutered yeah I don't
know English I mean think English like
Old English have gender that guys got to
have the key but now it's just uh
everything is fun if he dies we know
where the keys are
I'm kind of just waiting for Jason to
murder him and some like words that have
Jen over it makes sense you know that
was easy but some words that have gender
it's like how did they decide that you
know Cola is you know feminine or rooms
are masculine or you know what makes a
car feminine you know what what what how
when new words enter a language that has
gender did they decide what gender
they're gonna be some people might not
understand this cuz if you if you only
know English it's a really weird concept
I think most people realize that they're
like in most languages there's at least
two words for the and one is shaman in
the naughties masculine sometimes
another one that's neuters what what I
came in I I couldn't watch the videos of
people in German people saying squirrel
because it's adorable what was that it's
working I can hear you just fine no
German just has three but like if
they're in different tenses like now I'm
gonna and I'm gonna have an accusative
and dative and genitive and stuff and
then they the form of though gets
switched around again but it's just like
what part of speech it is because when
German people say squirrel they tend to
like say it like it's two syllables like
squirrel but it's like it's more like
girl it's squirrel but it's cute photos
Latin has no articles that seems like a
way of streamlining things
when I was in high school we had a do
you remember the girl that was an
exchange student from Czech Republic no
I don't any time you're with people from
another country share tongue-twisters
with them because it's so much fun and
she had one that was in Czech but was
about red fire image or something my
mouth could not even begin to get around
those sounds but but listen they get her
try to do how much wood would a
woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood was also sort of cute Oh a
shucks shucks wood shucks so yeah sure
tongue twisters with anybody any chance
you get if they speak another language
noted they want to know if you've ever
watched Happy Tree Friends oh yes thank
you
it's adorably violent you still make
those Fisher Fritz fished frische fische
so a guy a fisherman named Fritz who's
fishing for fresh fish lousy house high
is 44 consonants fifteen vowels that can
find into at least fifty 28 vowel forms
and four tone diacritics I believe it's
like Hawaiian like heads like way fewer
letters in their alphabet and I'm sure
they've got some kind of crazy crunk
crazy stuff to make up for the dangerous
house make up for the lack and be more
complex somewhere else besides the fact
that their words have like 111 syllables
have you seen drawn together no I've
never seen that aquitine I think
everybody sing I'd like to have seen a
fuse blow crowd blight loud crowds on
backlight flight route flight blue
cabbage stays blue cabbage and blue
clothes stay it just scrolled away like
proudest cabbage and flight I think is
flight flight is clothing maybe and blue
is blue sure
fight his dress okay it was like a
Claddagh cabina was like like a changing
station or something the phone is in
camp evergreen Wow Wow Clyde is a
wedding-dress brow Clyde oh that's low
brow like a bride like his brow blood is
brow a bride in German any of you have
the fuse you have a bomb yes I have a
bomb
Oh moral Orel is great I love moral Orel
especially the one where he goes to the
bondage usually talk to me I had the
epic Parker
they've been here in three minutes
mixing is not doing so great
nothing's a great mix Ian metal pop pop
Metalocalypse you made me wash that
right is that the one I'm sure you hated
it but yeah it's great
Hey they're never gonna finish it but
it's great it was the kind of thing that
I think it's cool but don't necessarily
enjoy I mean I give it props I just
didn't super into it Rick and Morty why
why why why I kind of lines that it's
just not clean moral Orel I really
enjoyed moral Orel was moral Orel was
like the evil version of Davey and
Goliath that I grew up watching Adult
Swim is caput seriously
what sure about that maybe you just
don't like her programming this is Karen
and so what'd she do with that gun
shoots largest thanks to the ride and
what I know we're fine but another girl
that you bring on stream to flirt with
so what who is she
this girl who's that way who's this
irresistible this is Karen this is my
fianc wall milady paramours that I know
I have no idea paramours gender than
whether that's a male or a female I
don't know nice work nice work
which is speaking of German and what not
what's interesting is look up the
different words for butterfly we talked
about this right explaining I don't
remember this like all right like so a
lot of languages borrow words from each
other in the words in more than one
language are similar but not butterfly
it's yes meddling that said this
meddling in German it's Papillon is in
French
it's Mari polska in Spanish it's
butterfly in English and there's some
other ones too that aren't like related
rubber duck people's exchange I think my
favorite German word is and I might be
pronouncing it wrong but this indicates
it's like a speed limit sign and it's
just a long word and of course you know
German has some great words that English
doesn't have like commuting the kites
and schadenfreude oh I wish a shot right
I just that'll be an English word some
yes chills we've we've adopted it
because I Brno and I don't think it's
made its way into Webster's yet there's
been de kite for cleansing okay I shot
in Freud it is great English in English
needs it needs apparently yeah mari post
says is is slang for the same way fairy
is slaying in English for four men who
are not too macho and sometimes men who
like other men have have they and they
not asked you for your opinion about the
Han Solo movie yet or they just smart
enough there's a movie coming out oh
yeah something about so in a couple
years they're gonna make a movie about
what young yeah yeah kindergarten that's
it that's a german word the garden of
children uh-huh just plant little
suckers stick them in dirt up to their
necks
let's creep yeah the time word for
mother is ma but ma has several means
lightning I think that's time yeah yeah
what do I think of now they're asking
about what do I think about the Han Solo
movie I don't know do you want to see a
movie about a young hands alone it
sounds good but I have faith in their
ability to ruin it I'll find a way I
mean you know I mean it's like the young
Indiana Jones they found a way to ruin
Matt I mean what a concept if you can if
you can win a how the fuck do you make
Indiana Jones boring yeah so if you can
find a way to make Indiana Jones boring
you can probably find a way to screw up
on solo although on paper a movie about
a young Han Solo sounds pretty awesome
how do you think Han Solo met Chewbacca
that's almost certainly going to happen
in the movie I think he went to piss in
the woods so they threw out you know all
the old novels and books they wrote okay
they threw that in the garbage that's
not Canada only the only things that
counter what happened in the movies so
your guess is as good as anyone else he
had to pee and he was going out to pee
and and and he accidentally peed on Han
Solo or on that Chewbacca because he
thought he was a bush and Chewbacca was
about to kill him when all of his little
bee
Chewbacca babies climb down on solo and
said you know please don't kill him he
didn't mean it okay okay and you know a
few Celestion in here okay a few came
collected gargle blasters later they're
somehow became friends how weird and you
know maybe han Solo was interesting if
you know almost nothing about him and
you can just imagine that he's
interesting like the most interesting
man alive all right you know commercials
you know maybe if you flesh it out
whatever they flesh it out with it's
going to be a disappointment relative to
what your imagination is kind of a
shadowy corners of your mind thinking
there must be something good
we're in the murder house that is never
good free XP they say there's no movie
more boring than Blade Runner boy rooms
not that bad the book was hotter but the
book is almost always but did you see
the movie we saw it I never watched that
with you because I've never I've never
gotten through it in one sitting when
the hell did you wash it with you know
it wasn't with me you were livin at your
mother's house it wasn't with me I have
never watched the Blade Runner with you
I know this because I have never been
able to get through a full sitting of
the Blade Runner you are remembering
this with someone else was it your dad
nah
my dad almost almost always the what we
as my dad watches are like cheesy PG kid
movies and the Martian he's seen that
four hundred million times
mixie and is dying an obi-wan movie
didn't they kind of do that it's not
like with the first pretty cool okay I
got you who did you watch it with Karen
not recently no your dad watches the
Martian every day my dad seriously like
every time I come over he's watching the
Martian which is fine I mean like I
liked the book and I put it on his
tablet for him
cuz I've got him tablet signed into my
account so we can share books with me
and he read through it and then we went
and saw it in the theater but even he's
been watching it'll a lot of times a
night yeah I don't think I've watched it
that amount of times
gasps my battery and he watches Paul I
have keys we need gas in a battery but
Simon's kind of all oh you know what's

Oh jar-jar had better not be our two
journeys women out that's where people
rule in this game gobbledygook says if a
villain locked up your ladylove and
challenged due to a match of Street
Fighter or Mortal Kombat which would you
choose

hey Jason there's some jerks hiding out
in the lake
they're asking does Rick have knowledge
they might have been rich have knowledge

asked because I sent a movie that J
happened to reference in a recent video
and I want to know if it was a
coincidence what over what I don't know
it just disappeared it's all surly man
this trackpad it's just super sense
that's it just rich of knowledge of the
movies that get sent to him I a Rick I
don't know is because I sent a movie
that J have been a reference in a recent
video when I want to add that the coin
sense or not did we
well sanctum sanctum sane or Zane's Obon
Zane damas Egon Zane's that nerd sucker
I don't know anything why shouldn't I be
interested do you I don't even know what
the question was I don't understand oh I
get mail and I'd put it on the shelf
it's possible someone say it staple
impossible to it's a coincidence I know
like days ago not too long ago I got a
copy of telepathic animals in the mail
telepathically communicating with
animals and there's there's various so
recently after the episode where we
talked about that came up I doubt they
saw that first and that movie see there
that movie looks really bizarre it's a
woman who very earnestly think she's
Natalie mr. Badu but like spiritual -
yeah
kheh mixing the keys are on my body by
the car if you can find the gas there's
a new Blade Runner movie yep
Blade Runner 2045 or something's it a
sequel yep soft reboot I guess so she's
a robot and he's maybe a robot and we're
definitely a robot I don't I don't
and what are they gonna do make robot
babies tender I think she's grass even
in it robotic you UWE dr. Magoo little
pretty much she should meet up with the
woman who does the cat exercise the cat
flexing or whatever I think they get
along
I sent you guys random shit and watched
every video since to see if it was
mentioned that's what he said possibly
and the answer is maybe are we get our
unbelievable amount there's a lot of
stuff trying to think of the ha I'm
trying to put a number on how many week
how many tapes we get a month it's just
assumed that of all the VHS cassettes in
the country like half of them are
turning up here just as a matter of
numbers I bet you that gas is upstairs
in one of those bedrooms that way didn't
get to finish searching you've got
videos from cults naked people doing Tai
Chi yeah the woman who's convinced that
she can translate all of your animals
feelings for you into words and really
we were wrong was it German you can't
say tongue about wrong or sung among
look we got a tip from recent Windows
Defender summary they said no threats
were found just tease me I did hear the
chime somebody said someone no no it's
like the last time anybody the last
message was from gobbledygook about the
evil villain and what video game you
wanted to play to rescue your ladylove
Wow almost knock the mouse off the couch
oh this is like a really disturbing yeah
I know just look up I was troller rubbed
up against my hand and the camera move
classy rich exactly it was an accident
giving you the googly eyes crotch cut
shot giving you the googly eyes
they don't believe it was an accident
look if I'm gonna focus on one of their
buds it's not Brittany all right it's
fine she's not the first choice rotation
goes the house
come to mommy Jason
come to mommy
the deer hunters
yeah largely about Russian roulette the
Vietnam War POWs forced to bury her head
currywurst unless that's like some kind
of slang flow that Mouse or something so
I got the volume a bit down on my TV I
actually couldn't hear that but I have
it pause that's way
I'm not gene I'm the whole German was
just a food but their pizza saying that
the last Jason was pretty good
they were on me like white on rice
sausage with curry powder on a green
curry or yellow
you two we're the only ones that hotdog
is not a sandwich because it is still a
hot dog without a boss hmm
somebody said a hot dog is not a
sandwich because it is still a hot dog
without a bun disgust yes an individual
hot dog is not a sandwich I don't even
really classify myself
well the burger with a bun you're still
a hamburger without the bun that's a
beef patty it's not a hamburger just a
beef Betty yeah need the buns to make it
a burger maybe make it toasted just like
Wonder Bread or something then it's a
sandwich it's a burger if it's got buns
not directly go for a hamburger you need
something to put all the other stuff on
when can I not use mustard onions
cucumbers little little celery salt
here's some tomatoes or peppers hot dogs
this could be bad
so what did Germans call hotdogs anyway
because I've heard that hi Joe who won't
just suggest to in German and a dog
who's in estrus what I suppose I'm
supposedly if you if you if you just
literally translate well I know I can
say this is not it's not fine hold
that's pig dog which is which half is
pagan which half is dog what's also
fairly big insult but I don't know the
Germans use it I think it's just kind of
a made-up American and so violent yeah I
don't remember her Schmidt our German
teachers I think he usually said
dummkopf
I remember saying once that that was
shrine honed was an insult of dragon
they can easily be misremembering I
don't trust my memory there may be a
sister man speaking villains on TV they
call people that any English movies so
the Germans do say hot dog just hot dog
I'm in the next house
pig dogs kind of an insult Pig calling
somebody a pig is never considered a
compliment
honey a dog isn't generally a compliment
I don't think so what he went wait
I don't know anywhere
the Germans think hotdogs are the worst
with a W for the worst Germans have all
kinds of great sausages we're not off to
a good scavenging start here
middle snouts
why are we talking about people's
periods I got dachshund the Badger dog
why did she just change their name to
vino hunt everybody calls him sausage
dogs
and the scorpions Oh for me two good
songs roll you like a shit no one have
helped me
they're taking your mama sweaters

translate understand still lead a
battery you lick the book so I'm in no
rush person isn't getting the battery

knockers not boring I played soccer in
high school
rich doesn't can I put it out to you

very poor repair stat it's usually a
smart idea to let somebody else put in
the gas and I don't know where you died
cuz I didn't see gas around here I
cannot put gas in the car there's no gas
to put in the car I'm not trying to
think logically I'm trying to think
smart asily what when he tries to
express because I was commenting that
that how was the gun staying on somebody
said magnets which you know would
actually work and they said don't try to
think logically why I'm saying honor
when I said I'm sorry I think smart
athlete daddy

that's already in the but they're all
saying yeah I misunderstood what was
being said all right in deaths outdoor

somehow German drugger he got weird and
there's a football cock with it why they

rose let them know that I am currently
streaming and that there was going to be
plenty of video evidence of somebody
using a glitch out other by no comment
cuz we had a game with her last game and
she was likes head in the water
but if Jason can't get up on that rock
it's an exploit I think you can
I like firecrackers
don't cite Geist yeah there's another
good one
the spirit of the times I mean I guess
we have that in English but we just say
the spirit of the time site guys is much
more packed this is the kind of shit
that just ruins the game if if in fact
Jason can't get up on that rock if he
can all right it's a stupid way to play
so you get scope and then rock and then
it doesn't get you over there's there's
some spots like that in this game I feel
like are common way just like they're
like oh shit I should do something why
isn't everybody just go up on the hill
at the same time some people actually
want to play the game and Alliance can
you blow them they do not they're not
had a function in this Friday the 13th
game where you can pick up dandelions
and usually blow them on a warm summer's
big that is not a feature they added
into this game based on a 1980s become
Jason I want you guys to help me want
trying to kill you okay so like if
regular dandelions are like the tooth of
the line nothing a home
how do I know that maybe you just trying
to survive
maybe you're just trying to survive also
dandelions later in life yeah pretty
much
like a little old white-haired balding
men dandelions young blonde kid
dandelion balding white-haired little
dandelion here's not white and if I blow
it doesn't go anywhere it's attached
some of it yeah all right what time is
it
I don't know it's late what I got here
10:16 I got I got one more match minute
I have one more round dandelions are
dandy but machetes are quicker I don't
think that's how it goes I mean maybe
but I believe this candy is dandy but
liquor is quicker just want to say it's
been a pleasure playing with you man
it's been nice playing with you too can
mix you like a young Michael Moore yes
crap crap
give me something good no wait swimmer
us not good it's 5:16 in the morning oh
god yeah would be shoe what are you
still doing up Speedway killer run an
Germany hmm where'd Germany how are you

can't find it
well she won't go that far this trackpad

it's too fast
it's said that the scroll speed is set
to ridiculous
Oh Dortmund I have never been the door
good lad I've been to Berlin and Munich
god best and booster the big ones
Innsbruck
well Dortmund this is West yeah
more mostly the east part and south
that's right
who's the better of man halen singer
their words more than one honestly I
don't know
by or later I'll say leader hoses are
adorable this person has no respect I
mean we're just you know probably
anybody actually wears them but they're
adorable I thought they were searching
doodles oh and those those red pom
things those red cherry looking things
that the black forest girls having their
traditional stuff that of course nobody
wears outside of touristy things
Munich is neat but the Olympic Platz
I'm sorry I hope I don't offend anybody
too much but the Olympic plots that
great plasticky stuff it's just what is
not very what is it what does the
Olympic plots where they had the
Olympics in nineteen in Munich I
understand they had the Olympics urban
specifically what is the plots the this
theme the grounds the the things okay
they had like it's like this like
grayish like glass or plastic he stuff
on pole is really weird-looking like
it's an artistic choice now that I know
as an artistic choice 74 72 72 sounds
right
who lives the one with Mark Spitz if I
tried German beer sure they sell a lot
of German beer here in Milwaukee and
nationwide yeah yeah there was some
nasty terrorist stuff in 73 72 olympics
that was really unfortunate disgusting
yeah I mean just just not good at all
have I talked to half but not today but
I have in the past I'm kind of a fan of
hack BOTS expressions it is hard to find
a bad beer in Germany because they've
got like all kinds of I forget that the
name for it but they've got like rules
about there's a law from like 16
something or something there were laws
in Germany about what you could put in
beer and still call it beer whereas in
the u.s. you could put probably just
about anything in there and call it
whatever you like took their time yeah
there's beer Germany Germany has beer
Purity los good einheit seqable that
what it's called
Reinheitsgebot
all I found and those like for houses
was one healing spray what allows what a
lousy campsite lousy campsite more like
like Upton Sinclair the jungle then
let's not do that loss I know you and
rich love hot dogs but you live in
Wisconsin now how do you feel about
bratwurst I don't know how does rich
feel about bratwurst because I like it
I've always liked it fine it's fine
I don't know what the officially
Wisconsin right way of eating it is but
I like it with some nice brown mustard a
little sauerkraut it's all good stuff
hot dogs and bronzes the kind of things
that to me mean instant heartburn yeah
yeah kind of avoid them
eight those and it's like a tums
festival which one's the French kid my
human is he speaking in French I think
so or he's just very bad at talking
do people play video games these video
games mostly in English then or do they
have like separate rooms for people no
that's weak no they might something
miles all right come on they might have
some kind of like server kind of the
host thing where you know you're more
likely to hook up with other German
players if you're playing in Germany I
don't really know
it's tasteless terribly lutely terrible
what an Isis and Tom's festival yes it
did
you're welcome it's 335 in France is it
really two hours different in France
than Germany here they don't wanna be
like an hour apart like Germany's all at
one time zone right america's got three
no one's got more than three oh all
right we've got four just across the 48
lower 48 Pacific Mountain Sun I misspoke
I just mean it's not too shocking that
France and Germany would be two hours
apart that's all I really meant then you
gotta go anyway make me feel keine has
yeah I heard about that that China has
one timezone and there's like huge
differences in like the solar time
versus France and Germany have the same
time zone so somebody said it was 3:00
there that's gotta be later than that no
yeah Hawaii would count as another one
and and I guess you could count like in
Guam and American Samoa and the
Caribbeans gonna be in the same its 526
and France and Germany yes I just I
thought somebody said that it was 3
o'clock 3 something in France what
shouldn't sound didn't sound right who
is this woman who me I'm Karen yeah who
else would I be
Karen I came here to talk about sausages
and fun German words and cuz I'm quiet
during my solo streams who came to help
well you know China says one time so
they didn't talk about having like more
than one time zone or having only one
time zone worldwide
would be interesting you would yeah I
don't know if I want to live in the
place that's where everybody expects me
to be up at 8:00 in the morning when
it's the middle of the night my friend
when I'm from the same place that every
place has to have their work start at
8:00 p.m. 8:00 a.m. which and I grew up
in Chicago metro area and now we're
living in the Milwaukee metro area I
have I have no map
I have never you on the right side of
map for the left Esther West
it's French barrier to me like it's like
if you go in a pizza restaurant and
order a ham oh you're in the car in
French beer I mean don't worry about it
just go I got out I'll get out with the
cops we're in the north part and it
looks like we're getting naughty is a
retro walk is decent-size just just pick
up whatever you see off I'll be fine
just go out oh wait there's someone
coming
who from rlm was from Milwaukee
originally none of us maybe there's the
station even trying
because what thank your community storm
just to give them that are out I was
originally from the walk yet I don't
think anybody is maybe Josh or Jessie's
chase from Roger come on Jason Mike's
from the Chicago area richest in the
Chicago say where these people are just
from oh I don't have the privacy well I
mean and they think that's pretty well
known the Mike's from Greater Chicago
yeah cuz you guys went dies yeah you
know you can go through backwards
it's fun uh the Jason even try all right
I'm not going out like that I need one
real match look at betrayed
and even one real match that was
artificially J's from Wisconsin I
thought he was from Lake Illinois but
maybe not I don't know
ten bikes from Chicago Guterres they
confirm we're all from not from Chicago
just from the metro along with about you
have to live 90 million other people
literally China gives no fucks I mean
all of the time zones are arbitrary I
mean I mean they had railroad time back
in the in the 19th century and if you go
by the solar time in a New York in
Boston they're minutes apart and Wow I
got ourselves some buddy arbitrarily
said hey we're gonna have 24 time zones
and then they tweaked them around a
little bit so that they would match more
with countries borders and stuff and
duck at International Dateline in the
middle of the ocean unless that was I
think I got a player killer here I'm
gonna do one more round but what brought
me to Milwaukee rich brought me
not again against this not in this Lobby
they do have a lot of beer when they're
working together though what zero kills
that kind of doubt doubt it does that
would be all of you Milwaukee has more
like it's like every restaurant has its
own microbrewery and flavors and stuff
that's different I mean you can buy beer
anywhere but I guess the sheer number of
places that have micro breweries is
different and some of them are good and
some of their experiments alright I
believe but I don't want to deny mixing
the experience blowing spirit where's
Ivan do I have any Suzanne well I like
airplane surely you can't be serious
I am serious and don't call me Shirley
thank you rich that's very kind
walk using an accessor city I don't know
if that's true but spiritually it might
be or Texas I think it's kind of more
like the Texas injury you know it's like
they talk a little different so they do
things a little different - they're
they're very big on their state pride so
I'll say I'll say Munich is the Texas
but I have no idea they're sisters
they're sisters
they want to know if Jason is glitch I
like that now no I don't think so
that's a fancy-ass cabin I think these
guys just know each other
dry curry ketchup sometimes says see Sh
amb
Meyer carries it in the international
section Congrats on the wedding no I'm
not good at planning shit
let's go just some peace then no we
should just we should just have our time
do it he's an intern administer your
kraut
they would I'm fine with this and crane
hand Christ says oh is that like the
claw moves but I love it when Karen
narrates the stream you guys are great
oh well thank you Speedway killer was
there a Speedway killer Speedway's like
a gas station chain I don't know if they
have them in Germany but it's a big gas
station chain here I hope nobody killed
anybody there I'm losing my will to do
one more
his the look on his face is like
disturbing like I'm not sure what's up
with his teeth his speedy way just
pretty much just in the Midwest yeah
every but seems like gas stations are
kind of local like I had no idea that
Sinclair still existed until one of my
Facebook friends posted a picture of his
Autobahn way cute of this kid on one of
the dinosaurs and I was like oh wow here
there's a lot of quick trips and they're
like ridiculously fancy for gas stations
we were in a gas station not that far
from here and they had like in the gas
station they had both a subway and a
Culver's and I was just freaky I mean
the gas stations and gas stations are
just good to be crazy so their speed
waist North Carolina definitely speed
ways in the Chicago area maybe up here I
don't know honestly don't notice too
much unless they need gas and then I use
the end of co2 the same ones I'm gonna
start reading some names people who love
subscribe today while we're waiting for
this horseshit to go down okay dougie
Jones says I feel a lot of pressure to
say something clever kick

fucking months in a row since we watched
in Zurich alright not really wouldn't
unizin or something not read we watched
in direction a few weeks back it's even
worse than I remembered
it's our favorite actors playing holo
characters from the Voyager writing but
turds are green and I still don't like
it better than first contact or nemesis
stop eating so much black licorice
because that's usually the problem
anyway what if your turns agree I didn't
finish reading it but turds are green 31
fucking months in a row says everywhere
it's walking distance if you have the
time
yeah but it's hard to walk across the
Pacific Ocean lake um for twenty four
fucking months in a row since here's a
joke that depends on referencing a
comment you made earlier in the stream
you've probably forgotten about leading
to this comment just becoming very
confusing 99 Sean 422 fucking row and
he's not sure if I'm gonna remember so
he's like putting his hand out to tap me
right it's coming it's cute
Sean says I have no idea how this
horrible week is not Friday yet still
nice to see the streams always thank you
just this guy you know for 31 fucking
months in a row says that's an awful lot
of months it really is I mean like even
elephants aren't pregnant that long such
a dirty words how long two years or
something crazy
she's TC 209 says really disappointed
that neither you nor Mike referred to
Han smuggler uncle as smuggle these
jokes write themselves can you can do
better
TC I have faith kindred 192 true Xenu
says four months breath Nick military
for 19 months in a row says hey rich

er yeah why does a great job on the new
wheel the worst thank you thank you much
I know isn't it amazing like every time
he turns out another piece of equipment
I'm in awe he really is good at this
shit like we were in Hobby Lobby looking
for letters but she didn't end up using
but I mean the letters that he made like
basically
from scratch they're nicer than the
manufactured ones he's he's gonna lose
1000 XP for that team killed he's not
getting shit this is just an absolute
waste of everyone's fucking time Blasi
and bitch
I set dance of birth you know you
remember them like the Hitchhiker's
Guide to the galaxy where God's final
message to his creation was we regret
the inconvenience I I think you know
God's final message whose creation
should have been well this was just
really a complete waste of everyone's
fucking done quickly' says nanu-nanu you
suck use your name for thirty three
fucking months in a row alright i'm
gonna pause here i'm gonna do one more
damn round
I can't ending like that's horseshit
usury is evil shit
how do I do it rich well normally I
would have just left I said what's up Oh
even though I would have gotten a little
bit more experience for escaping I don't
give a shit I would just guessing that
it only get worse that gets later is the
yeah the pool of available coconut that
late though is it time for tea which
means it's only like 8:40 p.m. over
Pacific I'm doing one more because I I'm
not going out like that that was awful
that was just fucking awful and this is
gonna be worse watch they want you to be
Jason it's just like random though right
whether you're Jason you're not does
everybody probably wants to be Jason
typically I mean even I want to be Jason
I'm not even playing that's disturbing
and it's alright can vixy and I'm sure
I'm sure will play again at some other
point they're dressed the same she's
wearing like the same cheeky wearing of
the same stuff is Jason
little Speedway killer I'm guessing that
hanging out here probably isn't gonna
help you sleep
I mean we can try to be boring you could
sleep we could sing you a lullaby and
goodnight gorgeously speedway killer
what Isis got to wake up in three hours
huh night is probably probably not gonna
help if he hangs out here to sleep over
not gonna be me
is anyone there has there ever been any
movie ever where somebody has called for
help on the radio wouldn't actually I
mean I guess in the shining like the
psychic guy eventually came but I'm not
sure if he came because of the radio or
because the kid called him with his
finger oh really
Oh
now bring
there's not even a phone here you just
came here first that's gonna do anything
to Jason all right that's it I'm done
