Saudi weapons bound to the same button
who's all right here's here's a 1-1
weapon slot one weapon slot that's
that's for fucking weapons I don't know
that there is an option to bound those
separately I didn't notice one there was
only nine weapon binding options fucking
one two three four five six seven eight
nine and zero
what
I don't know what the fuck to do
on that way we're stuck
but I've got a feed know what's over
here that's right just came from right

gonna be SMRT
shut up
you've added talking so stop it
I hear them are they I heared them but I

old this is a life to throw it a man
whole lot to throw at a man
rustles whoa
where's that exploding thing no not bad
not bad
Oh
those are some really neat though
Barents those are some really neat
looking Barrens all right what's going
on to the check you're talking about the
Fantastic Four movie ah you talking
about like Marvel getting the rights
back at this point what could Marvel
could Marvel save the Fantastic Four at
least far as uh the cinematic universe
is concerned it's a little bit late to
be introducing them it's a little bit
late in the game it's kind of weird
they announce that the Fox announces
solo doctor all those desperate
motherfuckers fantastic for other pretty
damaged at this point they're pretty
damaged they save smarter we haven't
people love spider-man people wanted to
love a spider-man movie people don't
give a fuck about Fantastic Four look at
Jack
they don't give fuck number one
ah we're so gonna die
we're
we're gonna die I'm going to do it three
years ago
whoo first time you've caught us live
who's that pick plastic John I'm sorry
it's ripping solos dreaming they always
suck I never talked enough never talk
enough during my solo streams rich do
you care at all about the Spiderman
animated series I've heard good things
about it spite never really getting into
it which one which one I'll tell you
this much the spectacular spider-man
cartoon is amazing
I guess that's almost ironic but not
quite I didn't care much for the 90s one
deal with it I know that I know that
shows got its fans I'm not one of them
like some goons weapons but there's an
accessible
it takes me an hour to find the weapon
iwami
because you have to have the same chemo
at the time switch through the different
machine guns
try the doom 64 port not tonight I don't
know that I'm gonna do this all night
because this is kind of mentally
exhausting but there's something else I
wanna give a shot tonight
I'm not good at this I'm not good at
this
you guys talking about now fine about
Josh plays great in the the Martin
review with Jade as a that was a fine
episode of reviews
it's a loving tribute to George Romero
what works
all right we'll save let's say well it's
kind of low but we'll save
eighteen bullet 17 torturous
alright alright save I was saved was
saved
we did not die we should have we got we
got nothing we are we are low on
everything
we are so fucked so fucked
I don't want to disable that putting on
the helmet animation
oh wow we're fun one fireball away from
death
probably not playing up till tonight
you wanna know my thoughts on the madmax
game what we streamed in a number of
times
I enjoy it though I'm not gonna lie a
lot of that's because of the license if
that were generic wasteland adventure I
would not give two shits about that game
so I like that game on those strengths
and license it's a fine just kind of
generic game not offensive it's not it's
not wholly original there's that
terrible like mimics drive around is Mad
Max drive around a barren wasteland is
madness that's fine
that's what I paid my money for it's
what I got
do it why did it switch away from the
shotgun
am i completely out of fucking ammo for
the shotgun too
I did not just burn through 50 slugs
buckshot they want buckshot wait
style no we didn't we just kind of ran
in there and died almost immediately Oh
almost immediately
Jim sucks fuck it was I have a weird
combination of mods and difficulty
settings going on it's on me
it's probably on me god I wonder game
and blame myself
yeah I couldn't shoot him because it was
going through the fucking is what I know
how about animation oh that's sucked
she's
this is the brutal doom starter pack wad
you really need some help
it's hard to quickly switch between the
weapons you want because too many guns
are bound to the same key I'm gonna call
it a huge flop in project brutality
how many more tries do I give this
before we we get sick of watching me die
on this on this stage
what one more time and on a hundred more
times huh - two more times what's the
deal are people hating this are people
hating this what's the verdict what's
the verdict
I need the verdict what's what's the
verdict
what's what's the verdict
I'm gonna try between one and a hundred
huh I'm gonna split the difference and
do it two more tries that's somewhere in
between
one that was that was one
without - I'd died two more times
yeah yeah all right it doesn't doesn't
let me start with just the pistol and
full health no you're not gonna do that
all right all right
great good nope so just before all right
let's say what you can all take a break
and watch this newer trailer you're
talking about from San Diego comic-con

[Part II]
Oh yesa Shanny nope just mega mega mega
update chatting is updated you welcome
and you know what this game is
yeah what's now good reason to use the
overlay
it's still not centered Wow Wow the
aspect ratio on this game it's kind of
amazing kind of amazing square how often
do you see that these days
looks about centered right yeah
and I was gonna turn cam on it's
actually not working
cam is not working so so fuck it no no
cam no cam the games not gonna freak out
because I put in a controller after
starting the game and it did not all
right there we go
play build I guess we go right into play
right and I'm like you do not all right
let me still record something a lot of
people will stream this
all right fine levels Brow's what do we
got hi so guys this all the race a 1 to
10 11 to 20 all right can you sort them
by no I'm gonna want to sort them
no God no it's most popular let's go the
most popular oh wow
Tetris alright new coop tetris play
how I get it
whoa all right all right sick one
I'm supposed to get up there
nope
oh-oh-oh those up as a shortcut but I
fucked it up
I go alright go I say it's a bad maybe
it is nah fuck that up which megaman is
this based on i all of the original ones
i don't know if it's based on any one
right there they're so far left and then
we go up top of it I kind of let you see
where you need to go before one less far
than I thought I like this I like this
mega makers is is getting my up vote
my memory could be a bit rusty some of
this could be just sprite art inspired
by Megaman other than megaman sprite
himself this could be different stuff
but I don't I don't speak of authority
there
I don't recall anything like these
little gray blocks
yes this allows you to create levels to
which I'll play around with that I doubt
I'll create anything neat
I'll try it'll be awful
Oh oh god what do we do what do we do
are we gonna go hello my god they're not
making it easy
I almost walked up the edge because I
was looking over at Chet
this infinite lives is a necessary idea
is that think the natural instinct for
people is to make something just
ridiculously hard right ha ha no one's
gonna beat my level no I can't make it I
should have waited I should have waited
what do I do
I don't know what to do
there's my question how come camp Capcom
hasn't shut these people down yet is it
not the same thing every time
Oh God I was looking at the chat again
no wait that disappears
you're going easy on me all right I
won't I'll take it
oh my god it's still going on
all right oh that's adorable
that's adorable oh how do i how do i how
do i vote on something i want to give
this an upvote mouse-over all right
that's great
top man's gauntlet wait
yeah I'd use the mouse to upload that
which this is only available on PC for
free so
I can double
no idea what I've done
so
this is only letting me use the top
power I don't have a normal I can't
switch to a normal buster
so apparently level makers are able to
limit your weapon usage oh wait I could
probably do the top jump on those no
jack jack is not tongue I'll show Jack
this he might want to stream the soup
I'm liking it so far know what I'm doing
now know what I'm doing
not well enough not not well enough I
wonder if I can do multiple jumps
Oh almost
I get too impatient or the end too
impatient
we know what to do that
as it
oh that's fun it's great
Oh top man I got a boss Oh Prairie
apparently he's just gonna shoot shit at
us while we while we platform
oh shit this block gap
that's got a lot of votes all right
let's try this cucumber as a castle
oh I think I just missed my ride
does it come back oh I get it
ah
oh sweet that's clever
I think the little extra live heads just
give you full health but screwed my
chance to get it
I guess it wouldn't be Megaman without
the powers you know as a kid when I was
a kid and I played megaman 1 I didn't
realize that you can use the powers of
the enemies you beat I got through a
good chunk of that game just with the
Buster good name let's see oh look I
found a hidden thing
it's a way to do this right there's a
there's a way to do this
I think that's it I'm gonna I'm gonna
give it one more shot so I can get the
loot I'm gonna give it two more shots so
I can get the loot I don't want to waste
my dog powers I need a smaller jump on
to the dog
you
I just need done any much
alright fuck it I like the concept
obviously I could not hack it of course
we could charger buster
yes Chatham I'm very sorry we've had a
lot of fun playing Friday the 13th
lately I'm very sorry about that
Oh
but I don't think I see what you're
getting and I don't know it'll work
put rush on the platform now
and he does not refill that's weird
oh we did it we so fucking did it
yeah that's all I got for that all right
yeah yay we got energy Seiko
no no no don't
get out of there don't restart get out
of this menu get out of this menu I
don't wanna be in this opinion I'm gonna
restart I'm fucked so you consume more
like make upstream I can't stream
tomorrow as we are filming a best of the
worst
doh
No
I'm just all kinds of fuck up today
aren't I wait shouldn't be one over
there
then one day the spawn
oh wait didn't jump
I needed to jump and I did not jump
I'm not I'm not sure what movies were
watching tomorrow a lot of times it's
the last-minute decision
there is another one currently in in the
editing phase I'm related to the one
we're filming tomorrow if we wanted to
hold back on that one a little bit we
didn't want to of the same type of
episode to go up in a row what
now Oh Oh OHS an accident all right get
up there how do I get back he won't do
the slide thing I'm trapped oh shit wait
no that doesn't work
our fucked we're fucked
oh okay I guess I can't switch off of
her
it's a little sparse but this could be
an original Eggman level and probably
throw a little bit more shit at you
there'd be spawning enemies coming in
Oh
hey we did it we got through we didn't
die
a single room all right all right
Moses get us top man we're top man that
man seems to be very popular
Oh in this novel until nice luck
it slide off we got a slide off that
thing
probably from the far end one
edit
alright this doesn't seem too bad
what do i do what do i do oh shit
all right panthan there's no safe
pointer
their Nexus next cycle next go-around
next train
oh it's nasty shoot this guy no how the
fuck am I supposed to do this oh oh it's
just oh there wasn't the checkpoint good
there was a fake that was a fake out it
was pretty clever notice it's just a
little too late
look at this sneaky shit look at it look
at him look at him
that was that was just embarrassing
in the spring make me jump a little bit
higher oh you have to hold jump
we learned something
all right let's get better at dodging
I got it I'll slide yeah I'm gonna work
to probably probably
I'm liking this
oh no not again I'm skipping got here
get outta here I did this one already
we're doing a different one
what I got I got 507 gotta go fast all
right
a vine sauce no one next
start on the side back an excellent
can i play a little uh yeah I've been
glove player level I don't know how to
find your level
oh I see what's gone I can't slide it
alright they changed the mechanics here
and there I guess you couldn't slide in
all of the Megaman so they gotta respect
that I don't know they gonna give it an
option so you don't have a slot at it on
them I've been using thumb that's gone
on and it's weird
it's a quick main stage way back in the
day
mmmm one day next slide I don't think -
did either
it's just weird I've been using it for
like most of these other levels and now
suddenly it's gone
oh wow they do not fuck around
oh shit
that was a bad all right search by
eighty ashen my level ID is one three
seven six one
so find it
one three
sorry it seems this list is empty
I chose weight one three seven
is there another way I can search
okay okay okay
metal man was his name was a little ban
was it probably was most fun
boss fight in an elevator this indeed
comes up
you can't say good time I've no working
camera I'm bobbing my head to this
I kept Oh God oh okay
did it crash alright we crashed
that's all right let me see see if I can
just I'm about the camera him while
we're crashed a media source was that
nope that's not it
my camera I want to give me a camera
video capture device
No
no I'm trying I tried plugging it in and
unplugging it that that sometimes
bizarrely works lighting up the camera
there will be no camera night camdenite
see my reaction to this game which kind
of adorable kind of adorable now there
is no other voice I am completely alone
alright do you see the mega maker
your boss fight was so awesome it
crashed the game how do you feel about
that
oh yeah fine levels miscellaneous enter
ID 1 3 7 6 1
yeah yeah thumbs up for me kid yeah
thumbs up for me unless it crashes my
this crashes the game again
Oh God he's got my number this side
it's got my number I'll do a search
sorry I don't think I had the charge
this time
oh yeah that makes a world of difference
it didn't kill that much weight oh god I
gotta keep how does it go oh my god neat
all right
and anybody else have one any other yeah
if you had a level post-it the chat I'm
gonna go back to browse though for a bit
I'm gonna stick with that most popular
Maes I don't know about this I don't
know about this
all right so we got to get
down there
I think we're stuck yeah we're stuck how
we restart all right it's like a little
puzzle
we need to destroy that one top Rick
we can't destroy this one that might do
it
like a little puzzle but I've solved in
a minute
shitty puzzle
shitty little puzzle plastic as need
myself I didn't mess up we get the thing
even I messed up it's perfect
I try one more years ten 3:29 all right
all right
well we hop up ox4 like trees chopping
down trees I get it Indiana Jones robot
that's kind of a traditional level where
do we need to go though nope should've
got on the yeah I was dumb yeah yeah
nice little traditional level I'm fine
with that
can you assign bosses a weakness to a
certain weapon I'll have to take a look
at the editor see what things you can do
in this I was dumb I knew better when do
you get to see more nerd crew don't be
sporadic
that was never intended to be like best
of the worst where we did them quite
regularly is dumb that was dumb wait
wait for the guys wait for the guys I'm
so anxious to just you know get in there
and keep going I don't wait for the guys
I shoot these Hey
oh my god I didn't jump soon enough it's
gonna be the end of me
can I please plug the vine sauce charity
stream yeah I don't I don't know much
about it honestly but I know vine sauce
is doing a charity stream on the twitch
what's it what's in what's what's he
Jared izing what's it for saving condors
or snails or what's the caus
jump-jump-jump Oh
oh shit oh shit I probably should've
rode that back over to the thing
one down this wasn't little slut was a
pleasant little walk in the park and
then we get here and oh my oh my god no
no no I'll be honest with you probably
could have used the checkpoint right
before that that part oh why doesn't he
maybe it's just because I've been doing
top-rated but so far these levels seem a
lot less garbage than a lot of the Mario
maker levels
Oh
oh okay I gotta walk off and slide onto
the floaty one so that's good
there we go
asthma checkpoint what's not here
Oh secret I like this
oh oh shit oh oh this isn't a bad
section or all I like this so obviously
oh alright nothing done him
- dude did it I do alright alright I'll
get it next time
nope nope you think Capcom is stupid for
not actually making this I agree
wholeheartedly
no I lost my bride oh I could have just
fallen oh wow oh well
all right
Oh oh I'm out of juice not a go juice
yeah all right let's get our teeth
oh you have to bust up the floor oh I
get it
hey you know what I like the way I did
it I think I was just fine
random lovin will do it will do a random
level I like that last one that was good
I think I need a one checkpoint before
that one section but I could have just
been dumb not being able to get through
there
Ferro man yeah hello
did you pop did you butt-dialed me you
butt-dialed me didn't you
Karen Karen it's okay
you accidentally dialed me and that's
fine I love you alright well just stream
it right now
know what I'm playing I'm straight I'm
streaming right now I'm at work yeah
you put your mother I don't say hi real
quick we'll say hi to Karen's mother
hello how we doing okay
okay remember remember Mario maker
that's it yeah yes that's what I'm
streaming right now all right I will I
will talk to you later I should get back
to work all right
but that's okay it's just a butt dial
all right let's see what do we got here
Babbage Oh
oh oh I like the power
Oh God that's got a rapid fire
he's not weak to that
alright you know what I'm gonna you know
what I'm gonna say about this this is
far better than a random Mario maker
level would be maybe that's because
there's just not as many awful things
that they can let someone do like you
can't put a warp pipe to spikes maybe or
you just get less trolls on on PC we're
obnoxious kids they don't they don't
want to use a computer I don't know how
to use the computer I don't know I just
want to use the console Oh God so many
dumb things
my punishment will be death
checkpoint checkpoint no checkpoint oh
this is scary
this is scary we are so close to death
play one of the down right oh I'm gonna
get to that don't worry don't worry how
do we get random a shot
oh yeah checkpoint this is fine this is
fine it could use some cannon fodder
this is a Mega Man game I expect to be
shooting at like that you need any more
crap like that that you can just shoot
at
yeah you can you can download this this
will you know what this will cost you a
mega maker nothing nothing I before the
stream I went to their website and I I
clicked download that was it they can't
charge for it because they don't own the
license and I still don't know why
Capcom hasn't come down with the
banhammer sniper Joe's could probably
use a little bit of spacing between
their shots make it a little bit easier
to jump through it and they should be
green their sniper Joe's why aren't they
green you see what you have to go
through didn't look that bad doesn't
look that bad let's just have got a
fake-out coming up
nothing nothing
but I keep hearing that Thor trailer is
really awesome
Oh Tom that was so dumb
why did I do that so the new Thor
trailer is there more planet hokey kind
of stuff or is that just one brief
hamaji scene
asked it as the ship that's the ship no
rush no rush
well has been great levels I'm finding
very few faults with this game
haven't use that much
better the damage
well bud trying to make Inhumans into a
show that's that's a really weird
property to make into a TV show
all right um oh that's totally gonna
thumbs up
I've gotten a thumbs up to everything
good level so alphabet alphabet evolving
good
all right browse most popular worst
rating oh my god
I actually saw somebody stream this one
and oh is this some garbage Oh God
now
okay okay I don't I don't know that I
have the patience for this you're gonna
be right on the edge to make that jump
stay on the platform I can't stay on the
platform because that red beam will kill
me that's a death pin here that's a
death beam
I'd say I've seen somebody stream the
see that little white flip above that
one block I should be trying to jump to
that's a spike I will die
fuck that's hard fuck this so hard
we have other things to use
nope nope you think it's simple you
download the game and you do this shit
if you think this is simple
50 more trice can't even spring
348 40 47
46
43 42 40
39 I need momentum coming off that thing
38 37 36 35
oh don't even shop
you didn't jump 34:33 I don't what do
you mean stay on that all right here
we're gonna stand the first thing we're
gonna stay on the first thing through -
oh I didn't you can't stay on the thing
hold on
31 doesn't say 130 29 there's a one more
time I don't want to hear anybody say I
did to stay on the thing again I can't
jump on that that's deaf I got into that
spring once
come on our number line 28 27 I'll
commit it in light of this bed
for six five
three four oh no wait
we ran out of commitment to the bit but
here we go
there that's great Mario maker does
never download that's it
doesn't get me awful
blame
cut man I'm double cut man
yeah it was music all right they're
gonna have to patch those little hidden
spike things up
this isn't that last level they were
there were some of those hidden like
over in that area by the spring I'm kind
of curious is there anything over here
no I can't get back up oh you can't go
down Owen
you can't go down the ladder the ladder
kills you the ladder kills you ah shit
yeah black spikes on black background
they're gonna have to fix that Oh No
where do we go I'll betcha it's right
the way we came right
where we go
is there just no way to beat this
probably a dumb hidden thing yeah but
Megaman doesn't have the like the hidden
blocks like mario has downvote move on
Oh we'll move on sooner or later I'm
just curious what you're supposed to do
all right a scrap
download it and save alright alright
all right let's take a look at this
level editor
hey I do all right
that's Wiley oh there
hello the jackal probably did some old
German man voice the grape yeah I can do
it like like rush but he's not Russian
hello there you're here to create your
own levels I assume then you've come to
the right place
I've used this editor to create my
award-winning stages for years and I get
it I get it
allow me to teach you the ins and outs
of the stage editor so you can give that
pesky Mega Man or its money DeLuca's one
day you'll be able to match the dr. wily
don't needle same for me a real
challenge
hey no that's not a good way to motivate
them visit oh my Oh what are you doing
her home just thought I'd help you
enlighten them about the end two heads
are better than one right
where's this one of your evil scheme
oh of course not oh why would it be oh
ho ho hey that's it let's get this ball
rolling then shall we whatever I know
Lucas doesn't fit doesn't fit create
some train megaman can't reverse
watching him fall to his doom
there's fun at all but that wouldn't be
satisfying what hold the left mouse
button place terrain in the level go
nuts oh and make sure to press the green
checkmark once you're finished
looking good that the stage looks pretty
empty at the at the moment you're right
it's time to play some of my ingenious
robots you see the blue blue bar at the
top of the screen there you can select
all kinds of stuff to place in the level
such as terrain enemies and stage
hazards since we want to place enemies
select the enemies category and place
them in the level
switch different enemies
I don't want I want I don't want to do a
different enemy at all make sure not to
overuse enemies in your level I
challenge every now and then it's fine
if you want to keep things fun use them
with care
wait to ruin my fun this is not about
your fun Wiley it's about the players
I guess moving on normally using these
met enemies gets old all they're gonna
show me this is fantastic
oh I'm just learning how to use the
editor I know that's a terrible enemy
placement
Oh hurry up okay
why aren't you green as a sniper Joey
should be green you got a fair amount of
things
they stopped at six huh
was this thing
all right click I clicked on it no let's
use it
okay
that's a terrible selection of oh you
mean in the menu hide put a lot of
effort into this didn't you
I just got I got no voices in me the
word none of the work oh thank you but
this is just the beginning as I said
before with stage and almost for a lot
more than just the touring and enemies
play go back to our blue bar we can see
that there's a level objects category on
the right of the enemies catalog this
category holds a variety of objects such
as energy Perkins checkpoint stage
courage breaking live energy pickups and
checkpoints these can be a great way
player for completing tough section
don't use them too much snow
otherwise you may just make it too easy
for that blue bomber well why don't you
place an object in the oval remember
click the category icon to select that
category and click it again to choose a
different home
Big Ups
as for the exploding piggies come from
Oz where you got the blocks what's this
so those are definitely taken from what
what is that oh that's a good canister
we can put I think I get
my backgrounds select any background and
make a level of career go ahead try
placing one in your level hey how is it
done oh wow that's leap
ladders and death spikes between you and
me make sure to place as many spikes as
possible
anything to give that mega man a hard
time finally you know very well that the
best spine should be used with caution
using them carelessly can make a
level-two frustrating for its own good
you and your fair level design whatever
just play some ladders of spikes so we
can move on
no it's not
that's the thing
sending the letters oh they're in a
separate name oh my god look at look at
all of the different spikes oh this is
the one from earlier on the black
background so we can we can safely say
mr. Farah
wide variety of spikes in this game oh
you know these different ladders
Baddeley it's time to expand our lovin
so far we've only worked on a single
screen but of course my editor can do
more than that we have several ways to
move the camera you can use the arrow
keys on your keyboard you can use the
WASD keys or you can hold the middle
mouse button and move the mouse try it
there's the easy way we'll do it the
hard way isn't all I can wood
right-click undoes
weird icon between these screens what is
this for we're glad you asked this icon
shows whether or not these sections are
connected but the sections are connected
the camera doesn't stop at the border
between the sections if the sections are
not connected the camera stops at the
border and when mega man touches the
border he'll undergo a screen transition
by default sections are connected
horizontally but not vertically
why don't you mess around with them
some anyone has me climb a ladder to go
up can I do this tutorial later
yeah let's end this tutorial now that's
a lot to get into for just a quick
stream where I'm probably not gonna do
much with it um I didn't want to finish
taking a look at that one though load
level alright so apparently is a way to
get a crew all their spikes there but
they won't let me walk
but this is disconnected how did how
does one get Adam
it's just crap
can you upload a gherkin level
he left the level disconnected but
then I guess they just let you upload
stuff without being able to complete it
unlike Mario maker is that what's going
on you have to slide right I don't know
wait we have to get do we have to go up
is that the deal
no there's nothing connected to up it's
just that's just the top
we know going down kills you there's
nothing down there supposedly you can go
right but those things aren't connect I
don't know
I know I don't care enough I don't care
enough let's get out of that shit let's
play some more it's just some randoms I
think deliberately doing bad ones is
probably a probably a mistake
by not connected before however fine
levels browse wait where's the random is
that the slaves random level random
level let's see them again loading level
data data data doodads
what though alright
oh this looks awful
yes shit this is shit
Oh
hey I'm think dumb let's restart I need
to jump over the first few like an or
this is probably impossible
yeah that just gets the senses kill
insta-kill ah this is this is awful
no I don't think I have a charge I'm
gonna try and charge I don't think I
have one no there's no charge and I'm
dead
a Slavin necessarily he can only shoot
three two time Mega Man
he used to get closer you might be right
does it why did I why don't I not jump
let him get closer is probably the way
to do it all right I'm gonna let me
close
I get decimated early I gotta be good I
gotta be better with the jumping he
throws more often when he's closer I
think I need to keep him far what's
right
nope now jump over him hmm
treating
I am meant to jump on it and jump it was
that snake aa mistake I have I have a
plan B this might not be a shootout I
need to make the screen right and maybe
I can get to the next screen and there's
a hidden exit gonna get there before the
thing starts
No
oh look at this
horseshit fucking horseshit can I leave
a comment
where's the comment section
alright alright
redhot factory what do we got
this fills oh this feels classic
nice nice checkpoint and everything oh
let your man's party cool freshmen leave
all of them every power in the game and
the series
kicking is not the way to go I wanted to
try I wanted to kick him to death this
is a kicking power and then deep I
approve of this game in fact I want to
know what would what took Capcom or
while they didn't take him anything cuz
they didn't do it why having why didn't
Capcom do this on their own
that's my window
I don't like how your powerup meter your
your your weapon energy doesn't refill
after a death but
that's the only one we stuck Oh
Hey I don't remember you which paramount
are you from it's immune to that
Oh crash man's the way to go die
that's closed it's closed
yes decent state it's gonna thumbs up
six plays one thumb up or possibly three
down and four up what six play is not at
me two down three up at whatever Oh what
happened oh I hit back and we're not
playing that one I guess I fucked up
we're not playing that one we're playing
this one
whatever this one's gonna end up being
zero nine plays it's a reflector all
right
oh that makes you go straight down well
that never fucked
what the fuck
oh I get it
Oh barely barely ah can I get a thumbs
up for that if you're not getting the
thumbs down either brand Louisville
Mario guide 20 salt man uh uh oh this
can't be good right salt man that's good
it's got really good ratio of likes to
Plains you know
I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it
that's them salt mine yeah it's probably
what it is
Oh shitty spawn and then I got hit with
the ax
I'm afraid of spikes I just jumped early
well what if I just jump earlier next
time
nope that doesn't work
No
all right Check Point
I'm just moving the mouse cursor out of
my way really distracting
got it yeah so I came out ahead get my
dad
all right this one's actually using
enemies which I kind of kind of like
that feels very Mega Man II though it's
a little bit trollee err and most normal
Megaman levels whoa shit
oh so close to the that health which
lives under of rock what do you mean
what do you mean rich lives under a rock
I've been here streaming I haven't been
following look I don't give a shit about
the comic-con nerd updates so well here
bud sooner or later I don't I'm not that
impatient there's Megaman to be played
didn't these guys kind of move around
randomly in Megaman 2
let me shoot through that wall nice
anyway whoa
should be okay bomb man's what he is
these bosses in the first Megaman right
it feels like the floor should be
stopping the your shots not that I'm
complaining too hard okay the Train is
making this hard oh yeah
we're plug we are fucked
all right like in the may have no like
in the mega maker you got thumbs up sir
challenging I'm not completely unfair
not insane I say we go
six plays
all these guys
all right all right
I may have wasted that
it's kind of a bullshit army
alright checkpoint good
Wow
it's kind of lucky okay
and we're so screwed I just think you
know they give me a way to refill
so you know what less screwed less pure
than originally thought
imagine Jacqueline like this
what I remember of Mario maker levels
just finding you know random levels is
they were horseshit
these are okay levels like refilling a
weapon here it's a little bit tedious
but I think the game I think that's the
fault of the game I think the game needs
to refill your
that's all on me for second
nice I felt good can they kill me
another cat
yeah you're gonna thumbs up alright
maybe maybe one more maybe one more it's
11 I feel good about this when is the
Final Fantasy Tactics stream never 6
play is zero score all right
yeah this is a bad idea
a better way to do this somebody thought
this is a good idea I don't think I
could switch to another weapon while I'm
freezing them you have a second reset
reset unless I just left an accident
which I think I'd be okay with come on
the game doesn't want to play it at
Knossos levels crap all right they're
all froze which weapon they're instantly
backed out of memory out of memories
fade a little error I think I think then
we're gonna end it on that fatal error
