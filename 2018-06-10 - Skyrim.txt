[Part I]
our Xtreme button hello hello can you
hear me is this even happening is this
even happening we're gonna start we're
gonna start and just kind of hope it
happens here's my Skyrim did my second
PC work nope I just went back to the
original PC second PC didn't work it's
working
hello hello everybody we are only an
hour late today you're welcome you're
welcome yeah I got past the tutorial and
started playing a little bit just so I
would be comfortable with the controls
what's wrong with you I don't really
care about e3 so I'd it doesn't matter
to me you see aa new PC the the new PC
is right there I'm actually I'm reading
chat through the new PC right now it's
it's the the screen is right over there
you guys can't see it obviously I'm
reading chat through the new PC but I'm
not streaming through the new PC because
nothing is working nothing is working my
friends yeah this is Skyrim on the
switch because I figured I'd get more
play time through it that way let me
just get this up and running Oh
everything is just terrible so what was
happening with my new streaming PC which
is all here and and great I'll talk
about Witcher 3 latchkey kid remind me
to talk about which are three another
time please because I'm going through
other stuff right now let's um let's go
to boom-boom let's go where am I going
to
what it kept saying what my new PC kept
saying was I needed to go and enable the
direct3d acceleration
within all the the Ghibli job and when I
went into DX diag the direct3d
acceleration was enabled and so I don't
know why that wasn't working and that's
why I haven't been that's fine go leave
watches that's fine it does xsplit work
with integrated graphics I guess I just
assumed that xsplit works with
integrated graphics but I'm gonna have
to figure that out I'm gonna have to
figure that out I guess I just assumed
that because I have the because I have
the elgato capture card that would take
care of most of the processing and you
know but we'll see did we get a
dedicated streaming box yet I did but
I'm not streaming on it because it's not
working and I don't know why it's not
working I'm very very sorry
I'm very very sorry ok all right let me
get this over here we're gonna do a
bunch of stuff here hold on hold on for
just one second we're gonna I don't have
rich here and so kind of everything's a
little broken everything's a little
broken and I'm not even playing on the
TV
everything's broken and nothing is like
it I'm used to here we go
look at that look at my bar that's my
barbarian lady that's a doc that's what
I named her at a doc oh here we go hey
hey welcome this is a doc I thought that
was a good barbarian name got a
sweet-ass mace right there cool face
paint there's no great suburbs Kerkar
yes in the streaming pc there is no
graphics card at all because we don't
really need one
is she a Nord yes she's ignored so the
idea was you know to save a little bit
of money we wouldn't really need a
graphics card because we could just
stream with the onboard graphics and
apparently that's not working I don't
know if we need even even just an
entry-level graphics card just except
you need one to do or to run Direct X
right that's what it's sounding like
it's oh it's sounding like we're gonna
need just a bottom-of-the-barrel
graphics card just to run the graphics
processor to run xsplit which is a
little malarkey because you know the the
whole idea of the streaming only PC was
that it wouldn't be as expensive as a
regular gaming PC but I guess we'll see
luckily I did get the oh yeah I want to
talk to this dude I want to see what's
up with him
came over here
since the first gray Mane's came to
Whiterun Skyforge steel is all the
companions will use for good reason
yeah we all should be praised ad hoc
let's see here what do you got here
iron arrows pickaxe I've got a bit who
is a nice battle-ax
I got a mace oh that's a steel mace
there's that better than my mace because
I really like my mace what's my mace
hold on we're gonna check that out real
oh I have an iron mace I only do 10
damage steel mace does what it does 11
damage yeah I'll keep my iron mace I'll
be able to just sell some shit to you though
I kinda want my steel or X no I'm fine
all right great thanks bye you I saw
this cool ass 4G and I wanted to talk to
this guy but uh talk say cheese hey it's
a channel drop but oz talks HW is a
pretty good source for cheap GPUs yeah
and that's why he read the minimum
requirements I thought I did read the
minimum requirements and you know like I
thought I guess in my head
software minimum requirements shouldn't
involve a graphics card yeah I don't
know but I'm not too worried about it I
I'm sure we can pick up a cheap graphics
card for some amount of money but until
then we'll just use the old streaming PC
unfortunately I uh I overestimated my
own my own ability here we had a whole I
had a whole different situation where
the entire motherboard I got the entire
motherboard I got was fried the pins for
the CPU were all bent but I didn't
realize it until I had built the whole
thing I built the entire PC got
everything all together nice up and
running and then it wouldn't work and I
couldn't figure out why it wasn't
turning on at all I was getting no no
nothing whatsoever finally luckily the
motherboard I had has a kind of an
onboard diagnostic thing and it was
telling me my CPU was faulty so I took
my CPU no I took the cooler off got all
the thermal paste off took the CPU out
of the socket and discovered that a
bunch of the pins on the motherboard
were bent miss ah it must have happened
during shipping or somehow and luckily I
was able to get that replaced in time to
build it this morning but that was a
little
but that was a little much let's go out
into the wilderness and see if we can
mess up some people are things and I'm
playing this on the switch so there are
no mods that I know of and I'm kind of
just going for that that vanilla
playthrough just you know hang out do
some stuff check out what's the big deal
about Skyrim already it's it's alright
it's pretty fun though I did I did my
first mission
my first mission was to was to kill I
got a job to kill a bandit leader and I
just I I wanted to go in stealthily but
apparently I've really failed that going
stealthily and just so they saw me and I
just went in May swinging and killed
everyone I think accidentally which is
unfortunate because like I didn't really
know what don't jump off I didn't really
know what was happening I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't have won that battle but oh
well
and oh my oh I don't know I don't know
if I want to become a werewolf I did get
a cool spell that I'm hoping to try out
I got they uh
I got a no that's not what I wanted to
do hey still figuring out like the basic
is a conjuration yeah I got a raise
zombie spell I'm really excited about
that reanimate a weak dead body to fight
for you for 60 seconds that's cool
so I wanna you know I'm gonna murder
someone and then I'm gonna revive them
they can help me kill their friends it's
gonna be great
super excited about that I had to do
that the classic slow walk back from my
first mission because I wanted
everything I just wanted fucking all the
loot wanted all the loot there's no I
don't know what's it what's a grant
what's the minimum graphics card how
much am I gonna have to spend on a
graphics card minimum for for exploit
that's my question
you buy stuff from me how about that and
what are you gonna buy this food for cut
all this food I don't think I need it
unless I can cook later buy this for
anything all these weird I have all
these weird ingredients that I'm not
quite sure what they do yet no the book
of the Dragonborn no no I was
oh wait I think I want to think I want
to read that hold on first yes my first
time playing Skyrim I think I have a I
think I have a new magic spell here yes
new spell I love that by the way that's
actually something that I truly truly
dig is that you can pick up books and
and that's that's what teaches you
spells is like you have to read a book
and then you get to learn a spell that's
super cool
key ingredients that say what they can
about okay great oh I'm sorry Studio
Highland $38 right there thank you
Tiberius Kirk $38 graphics card that's
what I'm looking for if that's the
minimum for exploit whatever the minimum
is $38 an end 21 d3 GeForce graphics
card I love it all right we're gonna go
which we do oh you know what I have some
missions how do I get to my missions
again I think over here quests let's
visit the shrine of Azura how about that
where's the shrine of Azura
map
the shrine of Azura is very far away hey
let's not visit the shrine of Azura
let's see what else we got
visit the college at winterhold
how close is that maybe that's a little
goddamn it that's further away I guess
we'll just start heading that way and
see what happens all right let's just
head that way and maybe we'll find a
bear or something it'll be great screams
fighting mechanics is simpler than a
brick yes I I keep waiting I kept
waiting for like the fight to have a
little more oomph to it but holy cats
it's it's it's linked to the past
style of combat where it's just just
just swing away swing for the fences I
was trying to do like a little like
shield block could they have like put
that way I was trying to do like more
shield blocks to get them off they're
off balance but that didn't seem to do
anything no we're just gonna head this
way it just well we're just gonna walk
into the mountains that's my that's my
plan here
you highly suggest the companioning
quest I don't know I don't know is that
a giant to the right I see no giant I'm
sorry she's gonna head into these
mountains though
that's my plan she's gonna see what kind
of we're gonna or just gonna go out into
the wilderness I'm a barbarian these
mountains right in front of me look
inviting it's gonna be great or terrible
great or oh my god I got caught on a
stick there's no giant I'm not gonna
fight a giant I'm prime most definitely
not ready to fight a giant almost
certainly I'm hoping for like ah see
look I like a wolf maybe I can take out

I was hoping for it's just a dumb bull

Hey okay we did it whoo
if I ever play the PC how reevaluate the
bow no you know what I don't actually
mind the bow I always just forget to I
always just forget to equip it I don't
mind the bow was fine I just thought
they were friends I thought they were
friends I thought they could be friends
and apparently I mean there are they the
bandits is that it that's good I think
these are bandits and not friends so
it's fine I'll just take all their stuff
taken gold
arrows great I have a zillion arrows
think I have some iron arm up some
better armor now so let's go look at
that yeah
I just think the helmets are dumb
looking
I mean that iron-on was kind of dumb
looking too but I'll go it in
it's no way that I can is there a way I
can add items to my quick list cuz that
would be great because I want to switch
between my shield yes I can
nice that's great where's my that's
pretty good
that's my favorite and then add the bow
to my favorite great alright now I think
I'm getting the hang of this alright so
sir oh can I get in over here maybe
let's see what this thing is you an
entrance yeah you are Rob laughs an hour
will you still be streaming during the
Bethesda conference am stream until you
know whatever I'm streaming till when
whenever I'm just hanging out and
playing some Skyrim
I got the first person for that yeah
I can't use you
oh shit
what did I do
oh
I was doing ray zombies I want sparks yeah eat it I was
trying to raise the zombie I'm gonna
right now I'm gonna raise you as a
zombie to fight any friends see if we
come across any friends dingus what are
you
solid dwarven metal what yeah what do
you got on you I pick great
oh yeah have fun watching the Xbox
conference
I hope you have I hope you have a good
time you know sometimes in the past I've
enjoyed watching them live it's not
anything I need really to watch them
live so so we're here and that's just
gonna be fine nice add you to my
favorite and yeah why not
we're gonna try to be sneaky
because there could be bad guys around
any corner considered a chair if I
wanted to
a dwarven arrow
it helps it I always prayer too
what
ya dingus how did he hear me I was
sneakin take your take your gold tinkle
we got here we got some beds
my sneak increase today so that's
something
add when mere cog
do you see me totally saw me
there we go oh there's another one over
there that's why let's slide him on fire
you're on fire now you know the combat
needs a little needs a little work as
its you know it's just whack whack whack
whack whack but I also know that it's
not necessarily about the combat it's
it's about the adventure and the
amethyst pick you know it's about the
fact that I just walked up a mountain
and there happened to be just a little
dwarf and dungeon down here and that's
great
that is fucking great
where did that other guy go
another dude
they're another dead dude I was pretty
sure there was uh yes actually I was
planning on streaming injustice to today
I swear there was another kind of
finance trimming and justice to today
but I feel like that's a game that would
take up a little too much of my
concentration and because it's comic
book II stuff I thought that would that
that would be more fun if it was rich
and I streaming that so I'm waiting no I
don't want the wooden plate so yeah I
thought that'd be more fun as a rich and
I stream dish and we'll wait until he is
feeling better he's feeling a little
sick today that's why he's not here
do you need any food another thing you
need
okay that's an expert unlock I'm not an
expert on Locker so I'm not going to try
to do that
I would rather watch this in and just
say well you that that's why I like like
I said if it's rich and I we can talk comic-book stuff and we could
oh, shit
and hey let's check out that Imperial
bowl
not that one to that one okay okay
and this has motive some motion Amy
whether it's good or not is a nice
actually that might just be more
distracting sometimes sometimes I find
motion naming very helpful sometimes I
find it more distracting than anything
I keep wanting to think that some of
these people are friends gold because
those guys didn't get up to attack me
what if they're friends what if they're
like they're like being captured I don't
want to just kill them and then they're
like oh we OH
a consortium key nice like we were being
held by the bandits is that the
consortium we'll figure that out later
we gotta how do I have a level up know
who I do have a level of what are we
gonna do what are we gonna do ah I did
help last time so let's do stamina this
time and then let's see here I think I
did I did a restoration last time I did
like a novice restoration I don't know
if that did me any good loop excuse me
that wasn't done leveling up yet
iteration no I am I have no idea what
any of these things mean you know I know
these are things that can kind of go up
automatically as you use them you know
let's move that's right let's raise my
pickpocket let's do that
I want to I feel like I want to steal
stuff from people Jack you have a heart
of gold I have a heart of gold and
will my detected by
I don't know how you made it this far
but you'll go no farther oh oh okay
shit
friend yeah I was here to talk to
you I was here to talk to you and have a
good time
Oh, no
oh, shit
I died
that's actually my first time dying
I= definitely should have arrowed him
I thought he was gonna be my friend
but uh apparently not
oh my god do all this over again yeah I
don't know I know you know what no I
know
arrow arrow all these mother fuckers
yeah sneak increase a ton that we know
that stuff on the floor Jack you could
have set it on fire and cut oh that's
good to know
old lockpick oh wait now you had an
arrow key that my arrow and I might I'm
just taking my arrows out of his corpse
which I'm totally okay with take all
this stuff again
there another guy like here forget
great
it's all great this is a neat game this
is a neat game and I get it you know I
think I get it why my people are so into
this game it's you know me I think that
word is bad there's a guy behind the
pillar right oh no I'm moving faster this time
oh, shit
okay we're gonna flames and we're gonna
go I don't have my
we got him we got him we got him do we
but do we know
I want a little heel there there we go
everything's fine
oh, shit
the combat is so clunky the combat is so
so very clunky which you know I guess
we're just gonna have to be okay with
it's just it really it's just something
I need to get used to but very very
clunky lockpick of course I'm taking all
the walking's gold great like I and I
could play in third-person I suppose I
just you know just trying to figure out
which one is is the better fit
I forget I forget where these other
dudes are so we've got to be a little
more sneaky now
use faster weapons it's lunch clunky can
I level up already Oh cuz I didn't
because I didn't save after I leveled up
let's look at stamina again man yeah I
want to play I wanna I want to be a
sneaky pick pot I want to be a barbarian
pickpocket makes perfect sense and then
what I'm gonna do is be really smart and
safe boom Savin
gonna have a little afternoon coffee
just got to show hot take how's the
sneaking going you know I died I died
once I don't think I need to use my
points to level up one handing skill
because I keep loving leveling that up
by just using a one-handed weapon
so I don't think I need to worry about
spending my points on leveling up one
handedness because I can just use my one
a handed weapon and level up naturally
like that
oh okay
just hate the ruins of azor Merrik that
way that where I am
I kill I kill are you people that's
right that's right
if you can sneak right up behind someone
if you're sneak is good enough you get
extra damage that way oh yeah let's be
sneaky then let's be sneaky and need any
of you
just gonna walk really slowly because I
think there's a guy and there's guys
over here we're gonna try to take him
out
because we know they're here this time
so let's get our Imperial bow right away
and
I know it okay well that was much easier
fine close but I can get some money for
those
well that was much easier food
Bannen one of you had an item with that
one of you had a key on you if I
remember which one of you had a key on you
bolts Jim whoa
nice
oh
oh, shit
now i got too much shit on me
I did the thing
I did the thing where I have too much shit on me
let's start drinking my wine
eating some cabbage
damnit what can I put down
drop you they don't really help
I'm not wearing any of you I don't care
about you don't care about you how's
that nope not yet and and we're go there
we go
nope still over all right now
oh
well, fuck it's gonna have to be fine you
got the key
great
I'll all fake III is all fake trailers
it's true
can't I said can I sell the Dwemer metal
cuz if I can sell that for a decent
price then I want to hold on to it
alright what can I do what can I sell
the metal for the giant mace in my hand
the one that I'm using I'm using the
giant mace in my hand so I'd like to
keep that I have a bunch of this stuff
that I can like I want to keep the
pickaxe say good I'm not really using
the war axe is that a one-handed weapon
yeah I guess I can drop the macing just
keep the keep the axe amazed boy I mean
that's thirteen wait right there a
hunting bow I'm not really using oh that
that's a hundred and thirty-five gold
though nice just 20 damage look at that
thing
Oh dog I mean you know you just kind of
want to keep that because it's cool drop
the do a mere medal
you guys keep saying I should drop the
Dwemer medal which almost makes me want
to not drop it because I think I think
you guys are messing with me like this
uh let's make the this a favorite and
then let's make our steel war axe a
favorite
that's gonna get somebody's attention
oh look you've raised a zombie
let's go raised a zombie
come on come on
oh I can't raise you oh did I hit the
bow is that my problem
don't try some
yeah drop it jack keep in mind how much
it weighs and how much you get it sure
and I guess like I'm not super concerned
about goal right now but now yeah yeah
be my zombie come on oh yeah you're
gonna be must come on
like I know let him go like an arrow in
his head
let's go zombie we're damn it
where'd my zombie go yeah they are oh
you went to get a weapon awesome
Oh
okay
oh, shit
oh, shit
well he killed me right quickly didn't
he killed me like right away
yeah
that zombie
kind of a weak-ass zombie
i really should have been firing arrows into that guy when my zombie was fighting him
that was my fault
we're gonna we've we've learned some
lessons and we're gonna and not pick up
so much metal this time I'm gonna heat a
little bit of it to see how much money
we make out of it which metal do I have
right now
get a broom oh it's only 20 yeah we can
drop that oh I see I see what you're
saying it isn't really not worth a lot I
absolutely see what you're saying all
right I'm with you I get you your
conjuring skill determines how powerful
your zombie is okay well so I still
think I want to conjure one just so I
can you know up my skill run up your
skill level let's take a look at our
weapons here I turn you into a favorite
alright
because that seems like the smart thing
to do right
and shop
I'm on motion controls
what oh you want to go investigate where
the arrow went
nice
did i get ya
oh, shit
dick shot okay okay okay okay
and the steelworks
sing mercy I'm sorry sir I was not
listening to you
okay great we did it
we did it everything's fine everything's
gonna be fine
I'm gonna save now after this as soon as
I take all their shit
we're gonna save
we're gonna raise one of them as a zombie
search want that
yeah these fine clothes go for go for
just as much as all that metal and there
they are significantly lighter so yes
you all are right to that metal was
worthless a key great you know let's do
a little more exploring first let's
let's try to be smart I know we're not
usually smart and by we I of course mean
me but I'm trying here
uh-huh I was there a whole second way in
here and I could have like sprung those
arrows oh that's cool all oh if I if I
had if I had decent lock-picking
I could have sprung a trap I get it I
get it that's neat that's neat see
that's fun that's fun
big guys oh oh you know what I didn't
save let's save the big guys over there
so we are going to figure out
but if I keep conjuring and upping your
skill yeah just don't expect use not me
to be too useful yet thank you I will
not expect my zombie to be terribly
useful yet
Who am I got a brain
let's bring you you seem to be pretty
good last time and you have your sword
zombie
come on zombie
but he runs away to go get his sword
dink
see if my a zombie can draw him out and

bandit thug to come out here flip the
switch

Jesus each crisp
oh my keyword he is too much
that pink goo on the floor is flammable
oil oh yeah I got a we got to come up
with a better option luckily I saved
right before that we got to come up with
a better option here to kill this dude
because he is freaking some havoc on me
he is too
he is a little too powerful
what are you
come on the floor is flammable book that
book Oh No I want to take that book

thing that happened but I'm not gonna
worry about it too much I got I got a
whole plan here

going to come around here
right in the head
can you get up flames
oh come on oh no we almost did it this
time we almost did it perks give you
bucks and make your skills stronger all
right well that's you know I the that
time I feel like was our closest that
was the closest so we get a zombie we
shoot arrows in the guy we light him on
fire right like we we got we got the
makings of a thing here now I just got
to get good that's the thing here now we
know that's not what I want the last
part of the equation is me just getting
good which I can do I feel like I can
zombie and then Bo Imperial ball there

there

it's not helping
shit
damn it
damn it
damn it

oh, fuck
fuck
fuck
fuck
fuck
fuck
fuck
uh
come in Thank You Fist full of groovy um
might be too high level I I feel like
I'm close now you know the one of my
issues right now is I'm still I haven't
internalized all of the controls yet and
I'm still stumbling over just how to do
basic stuff like I keep trying to I keep
trying to run and that's the Crouch
button cuz there nope
there is no run button that I know of
you guys are about to tell me what the
run button it's not sure but because
there is so a lot of it is mean just
like I said it's it's I'm struggling
with the basic controls which it's fine
because I haven't really been playing
the game for for that long
and so I'm just gonna be oh my god he
takes much so fast all right so now we
get that flames on
I got this I got this oh no I do not
have this healing
all right now let's go to our items and
try some potions because I think I have
potions that have my minor healing
potions
they have some minor stamina potions too
all right
you can I can I can tow this Jack
levelling-up fully restores you well I'm
I'm not I don't think I'm leveled up or
what what I'll get there I'll get there
guys we can do this we got a hold we got
a whole plan here hit upon the other
part is now my zombies getting them too
early come on zombie we can do this I
believe in us
come on zombie hey hey zombie
oh no oh oh God
see like that I was trying to get to all
of my potions and I kept pressing the
wrong buttons you can equip the zombie
before I wake him oh yeah okay that was
even closer okay now I got it I have to
be more on the offensive when my zombie
gets there I want to equip my zombie
before I wake him and then we're gonna
take I really want to take out this guy
how do I equip him cuz he had a sword
right didn't he have a sword yeah he has
a great sword on him
but he doesn't take it why doesn't he
take it
I know about leveling up but I can't
level up my side my skills are the way
there is guys keep saying leveling up so
now where's your sword
where's your sword my dude you know do
it mid-fight Oh am i leveling up
mid-fight I could have leveled up during
the fight huh
okay I see now I see them I'm gonna
level up now I love our stamina again
nice and then let's level up
our sneak I feel like we should have
more sneak
nope but but I feel like we're learning
I definitely feel like we're learning he
learned something that I learned
something new every time so like that
time though our zombie did nothing our
zombie was not helpful at all so you
know what let's look at let's look at
something here let's look at our our
steal arrows do 10 damage and what am i
using am I using I'm using iron arrows
which I'm going to do 8 damage dwarven
arrows do 14 damage you see what I'm
saying here like let's use our steel
arrows okay now let's get our zombie
ready
we can do this take this guy out and
it's gonna be great this is this is a
team effort you are absolutely right we
are gonna do this though trick him into
going over there then we shoot in the
back what I didn't even get it I didn't
even get a chance to level up there I
didn't even get a chance to level up
there everything's you get to determined
to kill one random bandit out of I do
faceful groover you're absolutely right
like I am I am I'm slightly obsessed
with this bandit just because it seems
like I should be able to kill him you
know
it seems like I should be able to kill
him and it's upsetting to me that that I
can't I know like I'm not super leveled
yet but I also want to go deeper into
this cave
Jack has a tendency for obsession I do I
absolutely do arrows while the zombie
engages I I just need to get I don't
know I don't know what I need I need a
lot I need a lot you know okay here's
here's what here's my real plan this is
my real plan here oh my god I got a new
I got a new plan one ray zombie buttons
buttons
to
get that guy interested so that my
zombie what are you doing now yeah
you're gonna go fight him right well I
get my zombie reason points so that's
something
you see me well you don't see me
I thought I had a decent plan there yeah
yeah no I I have okay new plan I got a
great new plan don't worry I got this I
got a great great new plan we are gonna
go full sneak this time and I'm not
gonna be dumb and fire arrows like I did
last time this is gonna be great I'm not
gonna fight him at all I'm gonna go
right around him come on zombie you are
gonna be my backup
you're gonna be my dummy and he's just
gonna he's just gonna think it's all
about the zombie this is gonna be great
all right so now we're gonna spook him
into going that way
let's get our axe back okay
Usami didn't work
shit
didn't work why am i crouching
we're gonna get out of here we're gonna
get it I'm gonna get my zombie points
and we're gonna get out of here that's
what I'm gonna do I thought I thought
okay all right
new plan new plan
this this is this is going to have lit
this is going absolutely terribly but
that's okay all right new plan
we're gonna do this do this
oh, shit
my
zombie points and we're gonna run away
boom easy peasy
bye sorry zombie friend
okay moving on
can you just run away sure why not I did
I ran away yes I know the oil on the
floor can catch fire too but that didn't
really seem to do anything so I got my
zombie point and I ran away I did the
the only heroic thing I could think of I
ran away
we'll go fight some wolves again yeah
you know that's a defeat what are you
gonna do that looks like a drop
good choice for anyway ad it never feels
good never feels good to run away you
know if I was like with that with that
uh the skeleton guy from before that was
the case where I was just clearly
outgunned there was there was no there
was no amount of skill that would have
saved me there but here it felt like
there were times when I was close enough
that I should have been able to make it
work I should have been able to I can't
get in I should have been able to make
it work
there's a whole thing in here so that's
a defeat which sucks but hey what are
you gonna do the answer of course
there's nothing you got I did I got
close I got close enough times where my
stubbornness wanted to take over and
just just you know keep pounding my head
against the brick wall until I dented
the wall and I know that was the bad
call but that's what I felt like you
know so we'll see what's over here we'll
keep exploring whoa hey hey there big
guy Oh Elk lolo elk
that's a cool thing to come back to oh
yeah I'm jump sure everything's fine
everything's gonna be fine we're gonna
go see if we can find any more what's
this there's anything probably not I
don't know
am i running around at night I am a
vampire a Nordic vampire where am i
Gillen am i on a quest right now hold on
visit the college at him
oh, shit
there was a book in there with another quest
alright oh I'm a dummy when with all my
dying I didn't save with all my dying I
didn't save oh now I want to go back to
get that book is it worth it
I don't know
alright here's my plan I'm gonna go and
do the the book quest and then and I'm
gonna go get that book and then I will
start kind of like the whatever the next
story quest is I did you know I did can
I go back and get the book Oh blimey Oh
blimey cry me I want that book now oh
here it is
okay all right we're gonna go back for
that book I feel like it's important
that book had a they had another quest
in it I wanna I want to know what that
is but and then then we'll go to the
next story quest just take a look see
now book Jack when do you think people
buy and do you think you know I don't
know favorite customers I don't know
what that means I don't understand your
question fully so I will not answer it
I'm sorry
that was a book in there
can't climb up there I character smut
because you have a memory of getting the
quest and will wonder where it is later
what oh yeah like that's why I want to
go get the book now because if yeah if I
come back here later I might not get the
book and I want the book now you need to
get a horse I do need to get a horse can
I get a horse because I would like one
I would very much like a horse
I get those arrows I did
there was a book on this table haha yep
here it is take
and that got me the investigate the
ruins of our level quest and you know
what as long as I'm here I think I'm
gonna try I try to pick this lock here's
like a an adept lock
nope
nope
how do you know
hey I did it
I didn't know how to pick a lock

[Part II]
I didn't know how to pick a lock
I honestly really
okay I did it this is so tense I did it
I picked a lock cuz I can only assume
that will come in handy later I don't
really know if it will or not but I get
past this fire maybe
yeah
all right great
solo a JAXA Skyrim stream you know I saw
a bit of solo speaking of of solo I saw
I saw the first hour of solo now I I
didn't want to talk to rich about it a
little bit I I took the family to see
solo we we had a Friday night and about
an hour in my youngest got so terribly
bored that he became so squirmy in his
seat and generally like I usually shut
that down like hey we came to see a
movie we're watching the movie just got
a sit and and chill but I was also so
bored by the first hour of solo that I
just said you have to go alright
I've done that already okay so I'm going
to do this one retrieve a Dragonstone
where do I have to go for that that way
walked out on Star Wars you know it was
it was tough but it was a it was a
legendarily dull experience for me and
so I was just okay
eating that that movie money cuz I was
so bored and you know I got to pay a
little more attention to what movies I
take the young ones too because
apparently apparently they can't handle
all the meth I figured it would you know
be
I figured it would be you know start
it's the Star Wars movie so I guess I've
nope I figured it would be good enough
for the for the little ones but
apparently not I I was incredibly
incredibly bored and as all right
current location yes
now where am I going I'm going all the
way over here
well dang yes so uh so yeah I was really
bored I was really bored and I I just
honestly did not care about finishing a
solo but fast-travel
I don't can i fast travel whoa not that
it's fast travel a thing I don't even
know where I've been
I'll be honest with you okay I can fast
travel great I did not make it to to the
the scene with the character I only I
only made it an hour in I left and Han
and Daenerys were making out that's
where I left and I just could not take
another minute like I I guess I could
have watched the whole thing but but
whoo ding what a bore what a bore no I
was definitely that was definitely
I was definitely further than than than
30 minutes
definitely when when Han and Daenerys me
meet up they just got Lando they just
got Lando and they're on the Falcon and
they start making out wherever that was
in the movie that's where I gave up
I felt like however far and it was it
felt like an hour
say the last thing I missed it was the
only party cared about why do you think
rich enjoyed it so much it's I don't
know that's that's something I was gonna
talk to rich about I I think you know -
for me as someone who enjoyed the last
Jedi the thing I enjoyed about the last
Jedi was it was a movie where I didn't
know what was going to happen next and
and I was constantly engaged in the last
Jedi because this isn't it wasn't a
typical Star Wars movie that you know
characters died and things happened that
you would not necessarily expect in a
Star Wars movie and it's very possible
that rich liked solo because it behaved
exactly like a Star Wars movie it that's
too steep to find it was very it was so
incredibly predictable that I don't know
maybe that's what rich was looking for
what the pivotal cape scene right yeah
that's where I left off is looking at
all the capes wherever that was in the
movie that was the you know I don't
think I'm supposed to climb this
mountain I'll be I'll be real honest
with you but here I am and so I don't
know I came out of solo just thinking
like man what a standard and boring
movie and I maybe that's what people are
looking for maybe that's what rich is
looking for you know in Star Wars I I
started rolling my eyes there's a point
in solo where we discover something I
that I didn't even know was important to
discover which was how Han Solo got the
last name solo and it was it was a name
that was given to him by like a by like
a nobody guard by like some imperial
guard somewhere who's like what's your
last name
oh shit there's a giant there's a giant
over here can I take a giant let's save
and and we got to that point where where
he was like I'll just call you solo your
name is Han Solo a giant can clearly see
me how
okay
and I started rolling my eyes very hard
at that what the fuck dang wolf
and so yeah like you know the guard is
like what's your last name and Hans like
I don't have a last name
my guys like who what you know who are
your people I think was the guy and you
know Hans like oh I don't have any
people and they guard go and the garden
thanks for a little bit and goes okay
han Solo and I I don't know how anyone
could think highly of the movie after
that I just don't I don't get it
I don't I don't I don't so I gotta get
there I guess I gotta go around the
mountain
it was Honda solo okay your name is han
solo now and and that was it that's how
Han got the last name solo like solo
just isn't his last name because Star
Wars is a universe where people have
weirdo last names an Imperial Guard gave
him the last name solo which is insanity
that's insane to me and then he decided
to keep that last name like the last
name that some random Imperial Guard
gave him he kept for the rest of his
life named his children that right and
that's a bit of insanity I think that's
that's that's in San that's a that's in
Santa san no good old schlock is his
name being han solo like a that's a
that's a that's a dumb name that's a
Skywalker right that's a that's a silly
name that schlock explaining what we got
solo and it anyway so like I started
rolling my eyes pretty hard from the
get-go
but I don't know I don't know
and then the there there was there was
so much that I didn't much care for like
right off the bat that train heist that
train heist was was it was something
else I say I saved before I thought I
was gonna fight the Giants so I should
be good and you know really I we've
talked about this rich and I have talked
about this wit nobody needs a han Solo
movie nobody wanted a han Solo movie and
the only time anyone ever got interested
in a han Solo movie is when we thought
Lord Miller we're gonna make it right
then it's like oh oh well maybe maybe
this could be fun maybe this could be
into maybe they'll do something
interesting with it as Lord Millar are
known to do interesting things with
rebooted property so now now we got
interested and as soon as they got fired
I lost all interest again I didn't
necessarily want to see it the family
wanted to see it and so yeah he's more
coffee
no I'm definitely I'm not I'm not
throwing I'm definitely not throwing my
family under the bus they wanted to see
it and that's fine you know the wife and
the older kid seemed to enjoy it and
that's fine
I don't it's it just it was so dumb I'll
probably watch the whole thing maybe
when it comes to TV I'll rent it shit
okay already
and yeah it just was not my jam so not
necessarily my jammer someone else
attacking me is that what's happening
here
okay great and I don't know maybe maybe
I'll feel different about it when when I
see the finish the whole movie maybe
that was the problem is I just need to
see the full movie and then then I'll
enjoy it somehow but I don't know
yeah rich is sick
rich is sick so just me today
oh did I pick up those ingots I don't
think I saved Wow Wow I'm not gonna
worry about too much it's plenty shit in
this game it's games flush shit that's
in a positive way this game's full of
shit in a positive way there's a lot of
shit in this game
and what world did the last Jedi tank
you're probably talking to someone to
chat well see that's that's the thing is
hopefully what people are showing with
this is the last Jedi did phenomenal
numbers everywhere it's the life that I
was huge last Jedi was huge and solo
even though you know made millions of
dollars it was considered a
disappointment and so hopefully what the
lesson is is let filmmakers do weird
stuff with your franchise that's what we
want to see we want to see weird stuff
and and so that's the thing is is
hopefully what hopefully what Lucasfilm
and Disney Disney's take away is from
this is there was a lot of bitching and
moaning about the last Jedi but numbers
don't lie ever people saw it everybody
saw it multiple times people dug it and
nobody cared about seeing nobody cared
about seeing solo maybe because it was
boilerplate and untain uninteresting we
already saw the interesting part of Hans
story in a new hope
right and that was his character arc in
a new hope so we don't need to see any
more from his character
but I'm punching you're punching
No
tonight a fire they're they're fine
they're dying fires your shit I really
thought I really thought I was gonna die
there I'm surprising enough I watch nine
just to get it over with now I know
people my age felt during the prequels I
can level up okay and let me steal this
guy's shit and then I will level up I'll
save I'll save nope not that that
I'll save you know this but you can pick
up the arrows the enemies fire you yeah
I picked up my arrow out of his body
that's great I have a hundred and
seventy nine arrows though so I'm not
super worried about holding on to my
arrows at the moment
I think
nope nope I think he went out like
there's there's like a rumble in the
controller alright nice gold the potion
of miners damn and uh well if iron
arrows suck ass I will I will sell them
when I get and get better arrows but I
have a hundred and eighty of them so I'm
just not that gonna be too heavy enough
great
I'm getting it I'm getting it I like
this adventure is I'm going dungeon
crawling it's great it's great get on my
waist spider webs
they will let her attend listen she
she's she's made it's that I I don't
necessarily know if we can blame
Kathleen Kennedy for the state of so low
she's made some good call she's made
some bad calls she's know Kevin Feige
and they ain't that the truth
she ain't no Kevin Feige but but you
know she also gave us the sequel's and
so I think yeah being all bad I I like
to the force awakens and I liked the
last Jedi I think they're making some
big ol missteps with these side stories
that's the thing that's the thing I I
think you got you got some good you got
some good with the sequels and then you
have a couple big mistakes oh man did I
hate rogue one I really truly hated rug
one and now solo to me at least was you
know underwhelming
but the last jet has real good man and
the force awakens was real good so you
know 5050 right now
Star Wars is a coin flip and it's only a
coin flip if you're going into All Star
Wars as a whole if you're if you say
okay the sequels are gonna be good and
then the side stories are gonna be crap
then you know right now they're batting
a hundred percent for for their side
yeah it's a Bjork I just disagree with
you I really I'd kind of like oh yeah
I really just did not like rogue ones I
think I did not dig it a little more
stamina
then we'll add sniffing the art of
creating and proving weapons enchanting
alterations restoration destruction
conjuration conjuration
excuse me they would like to illusion
alchemy speech
let's let's let's up our sneak a little
bit yeah alright we're gonna be sneakier
I would honestly like to see Lucas put
in charge we already know he can't
handle being in charge we already know
that he he's a he's a micromanager you
know if you if you put him as like the
creative director and you know give him
a give him a film director in a film
writer to work under him you know he's
gonna stick his grubby little fingers in
it the man had his shot he already
borked it he already borked his chance
I've got to give it to someone else
hmm
what happened to him what happened to
him
hmm don't know if I like what's going on
here
well obviously he used that lever and
died
so let's look around for a little bit
see if we can find any compelling any
compelling reasons to
what's going on with a frame rate I
don't know frame rate is fine for me
what's going on with frame rate is I'm
using the old computer still activate
pillar
snake
snake
oh no it's snake snake fish snake snake
fish right
snake snake fish yeah figured out your
little puzzle hey great the new computer
is put together what we've discovered if
you weren't here for the very beginning
of this dream what if you weren't here
for the very very beginning of the
stream what we discovered is that xsplit
may require I'll have to look into this
and look I'm sure your chat already did
but xsplit neighbor fucking I am trying
to tell a story here xsplit may require
a graphics card even though oh I see you
I see you
another little red dot xsplit made us it
may require a graphics card even though
we're not running anything super
graphics intensive just to preview the
video of the stream we might need a
graphics card installed on our computer
which right now we've been using the
just a motherboard on the onboard
graphics thinking that that would be
enough to stream from so I need to
invest a small amount of money into the
basically the cheapest graphics card I
can come across and and try it again
and just try it again let's see here
iced lizard game says hey Jack you and
rich checked out our game mute crimson
plus a couple years ago would you like a
copy of our new steam game comet striker
it's an action arcade 2d shooter I think
you dig it the thanks either way keep up
the rad work you guys do thanks ice
lizard games yeah I remember crimson
plus that had a neat art style we played
that a little bit send me an email send
me an email with the information gold
nice nice great the switch is the
perfect console I think it is I did I
struggled a little bit with whether I
forget Skyrim for the PC which of course
you know has all the mobs and all the
fun stuff but just knowing me and
knowing where I will play games if I
want to get a significant amount of time
into games I need them on the switch
because I just don't spend that much
time in my office I spend more time out
of the house and so if I want to get
into games I need him I need him in a
place that I will play them which is on
the switch because then I can play them
anywhere
oh love fireball bullshit yeah let's
read that no I already we already upped

fire spell
oh there's someone up here there's
someone up here

to know that a squirrel is a one-time
spell use

victory but I beat him

claw I know how it works the quad the
markings the door the Hall of stories I
know how they all fit together help me

now we can see how it dies now that's
fun I always be saving I know always be
saving I know I didn't do it
torch
I know the lessons
and I didn't follow them and that's my
fault I take full responsibility for
having to replay this section but now
that I know that that guy's betraying me
oh no come on snake snake fish fish
right that's the same snake snake fish
and there's a bunch of rats
are you better off I'm gonna get these
rats before they can chew on me and this
is where we had a conversation about
solo and how upset I was about solo so
we don't actually have to redo that
conversation which is nice there we go
when the next one comes I'll try burning
him I see if we can you know raise up
our our magic level - yay see look I did
it there's another one so how about so I
didn't like it but I only saw like the
first 45 minutes to an hour of it due to
seeing it with my my young child who got
the super bored with it I know I want to
take it which I get because I was also
super bored with it all right here let's
go you okay some of his urn nope it's
empty
number one save boom
he's seven my youngest is seven and I
had I it like had I cared to see the
rest of solo I could have I could have
made him sit patiently and wait through
the rest of the movie you know because
they're generally speaking they're
pretty good at going to see movies but
they were you know there was just a lot
of talking there's a lot of talking and
not not a lot of action and he wanted to
leave and I said fine I was okay with
that because I kind of wanted to leave -
can i light these candles
you can't light the candles don't you
feel like--that's did I think the actor
playing solo did a decent job at least I
I mean it's it's hard to tell because
his character was super weak and so I
don't think there was any moment
okay spiders in there you know I don't
think there was any moment of like I
don't think they gave him anything to
work with so I just don't know if I can
tell you if if he was a good eye like he
wasn't bad
and he wasn't noticeably bad does that
count
maybe maybe it does I don't know
okay no one was bad no one in the movie
was bad you know but but they just Timmy
in yeah this is it to me kind of
situation to me they just didn't have
anything to work with so it's hard to
tell like if they were like oh you know
the performance of a lifetime yeah ha
level up let's level up let's level up
didn't I do this already oh yeah but
then I died
great sneak okay all right great and
then we're gonna save again always be
saving no one in the movie was bad
except for the movie right well that's
the thing like no one named the movie
was noticeably bad because what because
they there was just nothing to work with
so you can't be being out it's hard
I can go down there I don't wanna listen
this time
yes the craw I know how it works the
core the markings the door on the Hall
of stories I know how they all fit
together help me down I'll show you
you'll believe the power the Nords have
hidden their lies today this whole
stream of riches sick
why should I share the treasure with
anyone
got it great a belted tunic no I don't
want any that there there you go your
dingus Bernie alive how about that
not food books oh here it is our bells
Journal
my fingers are trembling the golden claw
is finally in my hands and with it the
power of the ancient Nordic heroes that
fool Lucan Valerius had no idea that his
favorite store decoration was actually
the key to Black falls Barrow now I just
need to get to the Hall of stories and
unlock the door the legend says there is
a test that the Nords put in to place
the unworthy away but that when you have
the golden claw the solution is in the
palm of your hands all right cool all
right great guess what we're gonna do
we're gonna save again
oh you know what else we're gonna do
we are gonna wait till our Magica
increases and then we're gonna zombify
our friend here so he can help us fight
help us fight the dudes that's what
we're gonna do is there a way I can have
him pick up his sword beforehand though
like how do I make how do I give him his
sword you know how do I do that
Bradford young cinematography was it too
dark
it was uninteresting ever I liked it it
looks bland everything about solo looked
bland everything about it I didn't like
it and I don't like him I don't like it
that he just spoke Wookiee I don't like
it that Lando just spoke Wookiee and
that's how he was able to prefer end
Chewbacca where did he learn how to
speak Wookiee reverse lute is the best
way to say it in texts like how did how
did Han learn to speak Wookiee
oh I see I stored it I get it I stored
the sword with the body I did it
wait no I want no my axe back
it is I okay ray zombie all right come
on brother let's rock and roll
we got zombies to fight come on
all right
excuse me
shit shit shit shit all right
there we go there we go ok we did it we
did it we did it we did
aah what do you got on you drew gar whoo
ancient nord great sword I'll take that
that's a neat weapon
nor do I wait how's that axe compared to
my axe that's that's always the question
with these right like I got a steel axe
that's 10 damage bought if we got an
ancient nord oh it's 10 damage - but
does it look cooler yeah a little bit
Jax backing away game is getting better
listen it doesn't have to be pretty if
you win that's the lesson Master
Splinter taught us is it doesn't need to
be a fair fight the only thing that
matters is who wins I hope that's how
you all play - you just back away while
a while lighting everyone on fire I'm
gonna assume that is how the game is
played that's how that's how I'm gonna
play it
that's how I can't raise you into
zombies yes that's how it's played okay
great well good then that's how I'm
playing it I see I see what's going huh
whoops - dude Wow let's heal up I see
what's happening I stepped on the thing
all right it's that one right there
right he's gonna rise up no yeah of
course your honor
and I didn't save no I didn't save so
that was gonna be teaching me a lesson
but apparently not great I'm okay with
that is that okay so now we're gonna
save
great I hope you like Crips with
druggers cuz there's a lot of them oh
great great
well great I will come on friend you're
gonna come with me we're gonna oh wait
now we're gonna we're gonna take this ax
and then if I search you go to weapons
right and I take the ancient nord axe
and then I store it in you then I raise
AMI come on dingus let's go party
get your ax out
there's another one
yeah good job dummy your mod dummy now
great that that worked out perfectly
what do we want here oh uh maybe some
more help
I'm not super worried about magic I'm
not running out of Magica yet
let's get another sneak in there of
course twenty mile it well then sure
wait up great alright come on dummy
see well let's see if we can loot the
room I'm gonna you're gonna you're gonna
he's gonna collapse in a little bit get
stamina all you can early yeah it's not
a bad idea
just to just to get more stamina because
I just assumed that that come on dummy
oh oh no no no I'm gonna lose you know
all right well guess what you are gonna
be my new dummy congratulations and then
you store it in the corpse great
okay pick the weapons off the ground she
searched your body no weapons in its
inventory you don't need anything else
so much gold oh okay oh shit
oh sorry dummy
I lost my dummy that's all right we can
take these guys without a dummy right of
course again money is fairly worthless
through old Wharf Wow oh I'm getting it
I didn't save
that's great
all right first of all we're gonna save
great then you're my new dummy but see
the the axe is on the ground so are you
saying he's gonna pick up the axe cuz I
would like him to pick up the axe but
I'm skeptical on whether or not he will
pick up the axe pick out the axe see
he's not gonna pick it up because we're
not because we're not in any like real
danger I don't think he's gonna pick it
up so but then I think if I go into my
items now and can I give him the axe I
can I store it in him no I can just drop
it Hey
excuse me Demi yeah well I gotta kill
you again now you got in my way hey
you're gonna be my new dummy
oh shit oh shit everything's on fire
everything's on fire everything's on
fire okay so that happened all right
great
it's okay we'll just use magic we all we
have so much magic just gonna use the
magic and we already know whether you
got gold got an axe body here weapons
store an axe on you let's rock and roll
let's have you fight so my conjuring
skill get something wait is this on the
switch this is on the switch
this is indeed on the Nintendo switch
and it runs fairly smoothly especially
in handheld mode looks decent
come on dummy get him
yeah you did it good old dummy this
scroll of mayhem nice nice
I will save why not just walk into them
if you run into your companions you can
make them move okay well that's good to
know that is good to know is this
good I get to take one of you with me
what are you lash
they'll ask store and raise out me
great
no staves for you oh oh you stink no

these black falls temple safes that I
have I have so many saves I've been
saving I've been saving like a damn fool
did you die now you're still like this I
like this holes not a zombie friend
thing another scroll of fireball
who are you going after who are you
going after
yes we got my my conjuring up a little
bit that guy a great stream so far well
thanks Doyle I don't know like you know
solo streams are tough I die I have no
idea how other streamers do it when
there's when there's no one to talk to
you kind of you know it's hard it's hard
to just keep talking to yourself and ant
yourself so I am just trying to kind of
explain what it is that I'm doing in the
game so I hope that's not terribly
boring for you but hey you know here we
are
here we are I take racks and we like
this and restore didn't yeah because
then we're gonna zombie which is just
the best power in the game as far as I'm
concerned as soon as I saw I had as soon
as I found I found that book early on
that that make his aam be spell book I I
was so excited for it
I was so very excited
nice nice you're doing good jack and we
are proud of you we're gonna put this
playthrough on the fridge at home thanks
Fistful of groovy that's all I ever
wanted to hear okay you can't get
through there I'll lose my zombie friend
I'm taking too long
still with me now your lifetime
and I'm trying to keep up with
everything here if we have any tips or
anything but you know think I think
everything's going good you know the the
only thing as far as like how late we're
gonna go is how much time I want to be
able to see if I can fix this streaming
computer tonight without a graphics card
which is its sounding like it might not
be possible unfortunately hey you know
we should do we should save we should
definitely save
expert specifically says it needs a
graphics card dang it
well dang it
at least like you said you sent that
link earlier where where we can get one
relatively cheap and
and that's that's all I'm really looking
for is like you know we're not we're not
looking to spend you know obviously we
want it to be nice but we're not looking
to break the bank
there we go
those on rich to keep his old PCs he
might have oh he might have an old
graphics card actually let me I will go
check with him I will check with rich
cuz you're right he might have an old
graphics card
black folks sanctum
seems ominous
this seems ominous coffee and juice I
have to try yea grapefruit juice double
fists black coffee with grapefruit juice
to the the unsweetened kind of
grapefruit juice 100% pure grapefruit
juice not like ruby red or any of that
shit and it supposedly intensifies the
caffeine high and I I think it does I
feel it and it's just a good flavor
pairing kind of raises the sweetness of
the grapefruit juice now you know
grapefruit juice is good for you so so
why not
why do you not have a dedicated graphics
cards on the new PC well the new PC is
just for streaming the idea was we build
something that CPU heavy and almost
skimp on everything you know CPU have a
you know decent motherboard just because
you know we need a lot of USB ports and
stuff like that but but basically we
don't need a Ripper of a PC we don't
need a gaming PC we just need something
to stream with that we hook our gaming
PC up to so that the gaming PC doesn't
burn out its CPU and crash all the time
like it does and so we were thinking
that we could run the graphics off the
motherboard because there is an HDMI out
of the motherboard and that would save
us a few bucks as far as the streaming
only PC as that PC we're not going to
we're not going to put any games on it
we're not the only program we're gonna
run on it is xsplit and chatty that's it
and so the thought was that we could you
know kind of get away with it but
apparently I didn't research far enough
into xsplit and I didn't realize that we
need a graphics card
what's another one of those things
I didn't research it and as I discovered
today trying to get the stream running
and you know running late obviously is
that we need and I see and I see
what we discovered is that we need a
graphics card just in order to fuck to
use xsplit nope don't hit me with that
arrow please thank you just to use
xsplit you just need a graphics card but
we can still get a relatively cheap one
so I still think we'll be fine
Tiberius I think you've found one for
like $38 so I don't know what that is
necessarily but and so you know we'll
spend an additional $30 really the only
rough part is now we have to wait until
Wednesday to get it you know for the
next stream to kind of get everything
working again but hey that's okay it is
what it is
you know this dream is working fine
mostly because I'm playing on the switch
and not and not over taxing the gaming
computer with playing a game and
streaming
the FPS drop is just because the capture
card between the switch and the PC
corrects which is the other nice thing
about the build is we got an internal
capture card we got we got the internal
capture card with its own decoder in it
so theoretically we won't have these
dropped frames we'll be able to start
streaming at 1080p and even possibly at
60 frames a second if that's something
you care about
so these streams will be a lot nicer
once we get hey you know what I should
do once we get the the whole capture the
the streaming pc situation figured out
which like I said I thought I had
figured out but hey sometimes you got to
make mistakes before
before you even know what the solution
is right okay I didn't know I had a
problem but now that I know I got a
problem I can find a solution or more
importantly have Tiberius Kirk find a
solution for me thanks Kirk I feel like
there should have been more in there
doesn't it feel like there should have
been more bad guys in there that seemed
like a bad guy every room need a fork a
stream analytics say that most of you
guys aren't even watching this in 7:20
anyway I saved oh that looks like a boss
room right
analytics says that all y'all are
watching this in like 360p
hold on
most in 480 or ya know like three 360
480 like YouTube as well like most most
most YouTube viewers and these numbers
are still are still true even with
YouTube being on you know a lot of
people's TV now the the most view is
that that you will get on YouTube is
through mobile devices generally
speaking it might be different for us
specifically just because of you know
our form of content is a little long
form but you know let me open up the
analytics app in our YouTube and it
tells you what do we got here
and then what does that mean
it doesn't tell me I'm the
oh we get a look we got a lot of views
last month from from this being a
suggested video that's good it doesn't
tell me I'm the app but I can go through
it on at at home this seems like that
glove that I got right I can go through
it at home and I so I think for us most
people want it on the PC but generally
speaking most people watch it on their
phone which is not in high def what was
that thing called the golden claw how do
I look at it
oh hello wait wait wait
go go
here we go
okay what
okay we got bear ber a bear moth owl
they're both mad bear bear off owl all
right great no problem
there
I honestly just thought I'd have to
stick that thing in here but apparently
it had a little key on it moth there we
go want some who wants and who wants and
who wants them who wants them
I can move some light research on this
it appears that folks are able to get
the expert working via integrated
reference maybe try reinstalling Direct
X 10.1
I will look into that I wonder if I have
DirectX installs maybe maybe that's the
thing is when you get a graphics card it
just automatically installs DirectX so
maybe I will reinstall that or just
install it you would assume just with
integrated graphics it would work fine
just because the streaming program uses
mostly the CPU I just saved before I
came into this room
but
I suppose we're gonna find out
is there easy even a reason for experts
to require a graphics card I can only
assume it's for the preview I mean it's
not running anything graphics-intensive
except for the fact that it shows us a
little preview and perhaps what they're
worried about is the preview being
misleading to what you are actually
streaming out okay yeah that's neat
xsplit offload some of the work to the
hardware really
Kirk is saying that xsplit offload some
of the work to the graphics card and if
that's true
they're no bad guys over here huh yeah I
was kind of thinking there would be a
fight but apparently well oh something's
gonna come out of this right and as if
that's what's gonna happen
I'm gonna save like right here before I
open the chest I save right here cuz
something's gonna come out of that chest
as soon as I open hope gold amethyst
the staff of fury oh my god I got to
drop something I got to drop something I
think I have like oh yeah I can drop one
of those is that get me down yeah I
guess
oh my god I got so many treasures what
the heck is this
what I do
what did I do
your first one what what does that mean
did I learn a magic
what
dragon souls are required to unlock
shouts oh I don't have a okay I learned
a shout die eat a dick
Oh Oh yo I'm gonna die don't give me yet
don't kill me yet okay okay great that
was awesome
that was intense that was intense and
epic and and I'm very happy about that
that was great
dianna fire
please die
yeah yeah Dragonstone
boom boom take your gold - except for
now I'm overweight again
that we're not using the mace anymore
okay great yeah got it
that was great that was great prey
jacket it's you know it's need maybe I
think I think a lot of this is just
because I've been doing a lot of like
Dungeons and Dragons lately I do feel
like I'm a little more into this has
given me a ton of great ideas for for
ways to kind of incorporate these ideas
into into games that I'm writing it like
I'm kind of in the I'm in a I'm in a
fantasy place right now I I'm in a
fantasy mindset so so why can I you
dragons I need a Dragon Soul to unlock a
shout how can I level up poke nice
I need a dragon so let's stamina it I
agree that's the way to go
and then let's can I sneak it nope I
can't sneak it yeah nice
here can idle a quick it can't I like
for you 25 okay I know cannot pick
pocket it I already picked pocketed it
alright what's speech buying and selling
prices are 10% better sure I'll take
that you know what I'll take that that's
pretty good stuff get stuff a little
cheaper alright so yeah I think that
like that's why I kind of wanted to play
Skyrim a little bit is just because I
have that I have that fantasy bug right
now after watching re watching Lord of
the Rings and playing a bunch of
Dungeons & Dragons like hey got you I'm
just I'm just ready okay
there we go
garnett and get soul gem silver sapphire
necklace yes oh so much loot all the
loot all of it on a new axe though I
didn't get it maybe they want all those
swords would be great I do prefer my
axes this guy tries very hard to feel
like Lord of the Rings yeah yeah I mean
I get it I get where I understand the
influences and am perfectly okay with
them all over here the waterfall is
anything behind you know
maybe I'll just take there I'm gonna
look all around see if there's any
treasures any hidden
yeah looks like it's something do
something no it's a weird rendering
glitch okay great
like I'm okay with these universes every
once in a while I know rich often says
he's not a fan like the fantasy setting
but be honest I am I'm okay with him I'm
loving the stream with Jack say I sorry
I'm so sorry I just get so excited I get
so excited I don't want to deal with
saving we're planning what attempts it's
all good
was it
oh my god
we're where you
Mountain flower I don't think I want to
do that right
but I kind of do I want to take all I
want to take all of you
huh
really thought that was gonna do
something
guess it didn't
thank you for reiterating what's going
on with the frame rate yeah it's just on
your end because of the capture card I
also don't know why our capture card has
such a problem but all will be taken
care of soon shortly soon shortly
okay
raped we gotta go back gotta go back
over the gosh dang Mountain
gotta go all the way around the mountain
again dang it
let's take a look at our inventory real
quick
see many of our weapons great sword nor
great sort of cold awesome
yeah
steel war axe yeah
I wanna see I wanted to see if there was
a better one-handed weapon but it looks
like all of these are two-handed weapons
I do like my one-handed weapons
I assume this is a two-handed weapon I
guess
it's on Jackson because in the gameplay
and not the camera right and I don't
like I said I don't know why that is we
we use we use a USB capture card to
capture the gameplay footage and what I
can only assume is happening is just
it's just the transfer or speed you know
capture card and there's a bottleneck in
there somewhere and so part of the part
of the thing that hopefully will fix
this is in the streaming pc we got a
look like just a rack
part of the upgrade that we got was a
integrated capture card
hello I'm just a poor old woman here no
need to trouble yourself with me it's
tough just scraping by out here but I
make do okay whoo
what do you got there broom it's tough
just scraping by
but I make okay
I want to steal any air shit
who's gonna read your books that's okay
hello
I'm just breaking into your cellar door
I'm just breaking into this old lady's
cellar nothing weird about that
hello so ladies a freak
she's a freaky which is look at this
what is this
I'm gonna save here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna save because I'm gonna use
this and I don't know what it is but I
love it this freaky old lady yeah why do
you hesitate you can feel the power
coursing through your blood you have
only to reach out and grasp it renounce
that boy of yours and come come live

coven and your training will truly begin
yes he's a freak witch she's a freaky
witch and I'm hanging in her cell oh
hello I don't want to steal it I want to
read it okay what is this - what is this
- let's use it let's use it to enchant
an item you must know an enchantment and
have a filled soul gem to power the
enchantment enchantments are learned by
disenchanting enchanted items okay
okay so let's disenchant the novice
robes of conjuration which means
conjuration spells cost 12% lasts oh &
magicka regenerates
oh yeah that's something we want okay
let's do that are you sure you want to
destroy this item and learn its effects
yes you learned the fortify conjuration
& magicka regen enchantment from
destroying this item great all right
great
so then we take like my do to do to do
my ancient yeah okay I get it okay we
take like my ancient Nord war axe chose
enchantment can no I'm hoping I was
hoping to use that enchantment on my axe
cuz I use my axe all the time petty soul
is not gonna cut it is that it no so we
got to disenchant here so this is just
does target takes five point a frost
damage inhale okay that time II that's
pretty cool I like that Tiger takes five
points at frost damage and health
artists become their shows if the target
dies in three second fills a soul
jamming
what else can I shan't
you know I want to enchant something
that I'm gonna use can i enchant that I

know if you take this there's gonna be
consequences so I I assumed that if a
bad thing would have happened by going
into her cellar it would have been in
red as well that was my assumption but
apparently it was not it was not but I
learned a lesson who's that
shit bandits you know
yeah yeah fuckin bandits
what do you can do wait now I got heroes
fucking bandits
can't you see can't you see that I'm the
main character of this adventure
they can't that's the problem
Jack just victim blaming blaming again I
yeah yeah no I get that I get that I
hear that but at the same time I was I
was unaware of the law which I know is
no defense for breaking the law ignorant
of the law is is no excuse for breaking
that law but Your Honor I didn't know I
couldn't murder people I guess I just
thought that the that the the option
would be in red no I mean for those
bandits no I mean F those those bandits
it clearly said bandit under the name
I'm okay killing all of them because you
know bandits am i right
oh I was here already don't worry about
that
let's go walk back to town it's okay to
murder without a witness but stealing is
always gonna get you in trouble oh wow
she attacked me and then she wasn't
around to see me stealing so
so again her fault
doot-doot-doot that's the way we don't
need you right now look at it look at
all those places I can go ahead
venturing that's exciting
oh I know this place them's the Giants
I'm gonna fight them later not right now
I'm not gonna fight them right now
obviously it's not like you killed
children or anything that's a capital
crime in sky is it we'll see about that
if you steal some things from a person
the person you stole them from puts a
bounty on you and thugs come to kill you
that's assuming they catch me
wolf kicking wolf eat it eat it wolf
boom kill a moose
we should probably kill a moose nice
deer hide antlers venison you Inc kill a
moose

where'd she go where'd that little bit
that's crazy little bee she was being a
give me your money

to smack her around I'd give her a good
one asking that poor kid for his money
get out of town smack around a little
kid how is Skyrim in 2018 as someone
this is my first time ever playing
Skyrim I'm enjoying it I get it
a combat leaves a little to be desired
it's a little too
it's a little too dumb oh but I I did
the exploring the adventuring aspects of
it but I'm sure as I get more things
perhaps dating to just after the dragon
war if so I could use this to
cross-reference the names with other
later texts good I'm glad you're making
progress my employers are anxious to
have some tangible answer
Oh have no fear the yarl himself has
finally taken an interest
so I'm now able to devote most of my
time to this research
time is running foreign guard don't
forget this isn't some theoretical
question

error in the knee job no pleased to see

singles that have been recently released
what did you think of the previous album

previous album when it came out how I
didn't much like it I still I still love
halleluiah money I think halleluiah
money is a brilliant song and a really
interesting number but I think the album
as a whole felt to disjoined to listen
to and to get into so I didn't care much

out of this new girls album it sounds
really slick
and I'm looking forward to it I'm not

who says Jack protip ignore story and
explore whatever you want story is the
weakest part of all the Elder Scroll
Graham's although it can be very
therapeutic just to walk around the
world
while listening to some light auntie
music it's seriously great yeah you know
I I think the the only upside to kind of
following a bit of the story path is
that that's the stuff that is at the
level that you're at and so I don't want
to veer too far off I was we saw I came
across some foes that I could not beat
yet
so you know little give-and-take I guess
neo Orpheus and d20 dorkus
thank you all for subscribing I really

appreciates it as well if you were here

appreciates it as well
jack is never going to pronounce euler
property probably not because it looks

Euler instead of Euler I have a good bye
