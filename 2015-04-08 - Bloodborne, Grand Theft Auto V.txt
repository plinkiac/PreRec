[Part I]
can you ever know can you hear me though
oh right so I'm audible that's that's
excellent news
ah I'm not used to fucking around with
the audio so I Jake Jake can't be this
device I'm supposed to use and I've I
have no idea how to use I'm just got
fumbling around with it
trying to we're gonna have to deal with
rich sounding like shit until until Jack
shows up and then he's gonna bring his
his better sound equipment and
everything and we'll be fine
well buddy fine you know I'm sure Jay
set this thing up so I would sound like
a chipmunk deliberately I'm just sure
that's what happened back to the game
we're gonna do game continues
can you imagine what its gonna sound
like what I laugh I hope something makes
me laugh
yes no no before before before Jay left
him I he might be back later but he said
all right wait I gotta slip that audio
up for you let me let me take care of
that I'm gonna do that no give me no
give me the thing I got it hey I got a
step that up for you okay okay Jake okay
whoa you're gonna do that all right and
look what happens look what happens oh
that's nice everybody is still dead even
though I turned off the game and we head
to reload the weight it's saved and
everybody is still dead 90 I like that I
like that only I'm not getting any audio
in my headphones first it is a little
bit annoying
Sadie okay can I fix that we're
send me with some separate or sound
honey where it's gonna be a fucking
audio thing audio devices audio audio
right I'm not getting all are you give
me some audio out of my headphones all
right what the hell happened
I just died the game tells you when you
leave the game
haha all right I got dealers look I love
the game I don't love this forty fucking
five second long loading screen every
time you die that's just a kick to the
nuts and the way I understand it it
definitely sounds like I got kicked
unless everybody's not dead because I
died so many fuck
what I noticed it's not real it's unreal
how many blood echoes I'm gonna have
what if I go ahead make my voice sound
deeper do I sound like a chip off the
old
that is something silly for Jackson's
absolutely not it's absolutely not true
everything wrong
by the way I'm assuming that the only
fitting of song there's my son which
makes it that much better
I'm gonna have words with Jay about
about about this this microphone he gave
me because I'm sure I've been sanitized
I'm almost 100% sure much much to your
delight and my further
thank you
I don't I can be proud of it I just I
just fled from two old ladies and a
mangy dog for my life I fled for my life
first time that's enough that's enough
kind of started consternation darn
so many blood that goes you won't you
won't be able to believe it
somebody let that go
my weapon of choice is either the sword
or the axe pretty fond of the axe I
found that blunt-force trauma
goes uh goes a long way in this game

this take this on a PC take that all day
right now we're going

like let's just get set up please just
put the microphone on and everything
No
dammit
I sound like a chipmunk I know exactly
why
yeah the Jay do that deliberately no no

spamming a text that was that was just
magic

I don't want it this is nice hey
everybody do I sound like a chipmunk you
that's to be our killer what shit go
screaming like 30,000 were few worse
than we have now if we'd made that a
gimmick
we'll just ditch the whole RL everything
and we'll be the chipmunk Amber's it's
hard to reach things jack and ol top and
dole blood streamers I mean probably no

you say it's a murder of crows what do
you call two Proust
what attempted murder 980 first of all
nice second of all
that's so that's so okay jokes that's
fine that's fine
do what I'm kind of ready to set things
up what do you need to do well I need me
to turn on your computer editor yeah
trader is on okay well is there anything
wrong we're just sprinting through the
ps4 this morning why we just do that
rather than make it alight as want to
complicate it sure we can get different
audio setup that's fine
people like seeing the chip people like
see I think so do you like seeing the
chat chat
extreme the jet jet hey check your luck
see the chat check highlights around the
chat chat there's the check I like
seeing the chit chat
like why make a life more difficult
5,000 really I'm early enough that's
that's few upgrades it's cute yeah
oh that's how it is figuring it out yeah
that would have been nice
what I'm trying to read it jet you
Chaney's I can't think of any spikes in
the safety so I don't know wonderful
heat Phoenix it's just it's just this
it's trying to send me over the edge
that's what that was oh alright suppose
you know what you're sore it has your
thorn head fight forward had a fight
we need nothing to anyone you know what
am i whispering in this game god damn
dogs yes I agree do you feel bad when
you kill them no I feel I feel great
when I kill them because I hate them and
I want them all to die I feel bad I want
them all to die
I cannot just come out here and let's
play don't dance around in there come on
did you get your ass out here you dumb
motherfucker because I was some lava
it's a fairly easy boss but yeah but
what happened was just so stupid what
happened was you let your guard down
what happened was they wouldn't stop
attacking yes that's what they do
they're enemies they attack you
the bad guy won't stop being bad Jack
Jack I'm in no mood from knocking
mannequins no mood yeah you you take
that ship somewhere else
that's funny so this is something easily
that should have went the first time
look look see see that's what should
happen
that's exactly what should happen
I mean I agree
they're not exactly that not exactly to
that learning pattern harder faster
stronger she's about ready to switch
over audio sources yeah yeah
plug something in I don't know if it I
like
okay okay we might we might be doing
something we might be doing something oh
no game audio fixed
oh yeah now it's coming through here
again I think we dealt with this last
time how do we deal with that last time
as soon as you're done fighting some
done fighting some people okay press the
the PS home button and then you have to
go to sound and the screen devices and
audio devices
there we go or do that I would put two
device how about do I is this switch
that to okay that worked that work that
worked wonders that worked wonders
yes okay
back to chipmunk voices oh go back go
back to chipmunk voices nope
here it is maybe now I can't hear us
because our paws turn down for wat I
think it means like something's telling
you turn down turn out for what turn
down turn down for what if something
smells inside music it sounds like hey
we're hip turn down for what
yo to me it sounds like defiant you know
like he's trying to like he's trying to
be like I ain't turning this down turn
down for what
that's just how I how I read into it and
yes I know I could have taken the
shortcut but I'm I'm kind of from it I'm
for me
okay
I think I think we're actually good I
think we have good audio then we no
longer sound like just enough to close
the checkmarks Chipmunks okay which is a
real thing
chick looks turn-on for what for what
oh wait I'm going to try to make it
better I might make it worse
this is a real thing
okay let's see if I made it better or
worse testing testing testing testing
okay
oh that's better for me and Richie are
you here
testing testing testing testing one two
three ah mother fucker good now we're
not getting any rich but I but I will
you know any rich we're not getting any
rich okay that's okay so we can fix that
we can fix that
okay rich
yes fuck one two three testing one two
three one two three that sounds great
testing we want J what do you want
we're getting now we're getting a very
strange like white noise hits from your
microphone oh yeah did you get the mix
up oh he might have I don't think so but
you know what you can always trade it
out for a different mic and see that gas
that my audio would be fine who's that
what what happened is microphones have
to kind of standard kilobits per second
rates in which they transfer data and if
it was set to one and the ps4 assumed it
was the other it would make you
something to block okay and so that's
probably what happened we're gonna swap
out your mic though don't you down to
zero for a second don't touch audio I
know you guys I'm just trying to make it
perfect for you
where is it
joking poor taste or good things you
know you gotta go it's Porter's justice
justice justice justice justice justice
that's be testable ah that is detestable
okay
snapping right front oh my big dumb
dummy yes three I'm trying to figure
this out you figure out how many licks
it takes to get to the center of a
Tootsie Pop roll no surprisingly no no
good the guard is good this car his his
good garden
good guard bad good good bad good bad
good
I'm sure the chat is just loving all
this audio test goodness that's what
they came here for this is what you this
is why you guys come early you think
it's fine this is why you guys come
early right now
Rich's microphone is non-functional did
you change it out I did then apparently
this really is the bad one maybe the
other one is going bad too I don't I
don't know I suppose that's a
possibility I suppose that's a possum I
suppose we can just take that one and
put it right between us we could we
really good this is the real thing
like that
mmm microphone movement noises which is
good which is good which is good at
games in general wonder if it's my cable
it's still not a - fuck it I told people
hate o'clock so it's we're technically
early I'm still I'm gonna I'm gonna
fiddle I got my echoes 4,600 nice guys
have to kill that stupid witch oh god
you're not done yet don't don't call
them get all you got him gonna fight
yeah they're not gotten yeah well
they're retrieved in the sense that I
won't completely lose them a red I'll be
able to try and get them again right
you person in the chatter told me not to
use the charge attack fuck you those
were working good don't listen to them
you know how you play everyone plays
different everyone plays different I
thought maybe I might do more damage per
second then no it's not about that it's
it's about what you're comfortable doing
and if you're more comfortable with the
charge attack and that's what you do
whoa nice job
nice
Oh
whoa-oh she's up for there that's neat
during my fight she never went up there
gilad echoes perfectly describe the
audio no it shouldn't be actually
everything should be wonderful right now
rich only let Jack read the ten that's
right rich is playing
Oh God whoa
oh is that her with the sliver of mouth
or is that one of those oh yeah but
there's two of them well the other ones
dead
I see you like to double to have to
dodge to that's something that I find
myself doing a lot is double tapping to
dodge even though you only have to press
it once really
dammit god dammit Oh God get out of
there get on
I'm doing the color commentary
now you can't ignore the minions Jeff
racks because they're the ones that do
real damage here you have to balance
little minion little little head which
rich is doing a fine job of balancing
and that's what it's all about
fools Vern my favorite video game
producer or music producer my favorite
video game music composer is Chris
Christopher Lou I'm sure I'm butchering
his last name the guy who did the
soundtrack for risk of rain I listened
to that soundtrack all the damn time you
did that seal god damn it
then Prunty is also very there all right
be afraid what the fuck was that one
more oh it's awesome
it's an awesome game again spoiler alert
but of course it's not really a spoiler
alert because we'd stream to this the
last three streams because we just want
to keep playing yeah fuck yeah it's
amazing
yep right
sure okay you got it
what did you do it did you do it yeah I
did it I did it I was a high five right
there that was harder than I remember it
being the first time maybe did you have
more insight this time maybe I'm not
sure what I had the first time yeah
jay-z I'm gone okay yeah yeah
figure out what's wrong with you mics
are we getting

[Part II]
Mortal Kombat 10 next week there's no
plans for that my interest in the series
is minimal at best
that's a good way of putting it minimal
at best
where is the rest of the Forbidden
Forest I can't even remember what dress
there are a whole different area with
the with the Poisson Lake yeah I can't
even find remember where that is this
game is huge yeah that's way that's way
back it's not connected to this whoop
section you have to go back yeah you
have to go where are you trying to go
are you trying to get to you're trying
to get my coat with the Giants yeah yes
no we're super in particular sure did
you beat the spider
oh yeah no maybe this room oh no no I
assume in general yeah
okay pardon
I want to find the beggar well I missed
my first time through the beggar yeah oh
yeah yeah he's in um do you know where
the cannon is did you get the cannon no
oh do you know where the cannon guy is
yeah that's that's the other woods area
which yeah that's way back
you gotta get you have to go to that
area and and I'll show you where how to
get the cannons here well I don't have
enough strength to pick it up can I at
least grab it in the inventory yeah okay
absolutely
I'm gonna spend the blood echoes don't
worry I just scout it outside of it
I'll see what I missed sorry testing one
two three
one two three where the frig are you
now I want resistance right yes 1 2
check 1 2
audio check audio good audio check audio
good now I do check on it it did that's
as good as we're gonna get it oh ok I
think you need to make it better I want
to make it better what is wrong with it
is this mic still network that mic is
now working this mic is working it's
gonna be a problem I guess from Jamie
buddy he cuz he's gonna be on the debt
it's fine it's gonna be fine I think
it's a problem with my cable bud its
problem with your face jack audio is
fine you dinguses I know I know but like
for example speaking of level up
resistance I was listening to our Dark
Souls dream because I want to use that
clip because during the the blood-borne
review we talked about how limited our
knowledge is of Dark Souls yeah and so I
inserted the clip of us going oh someone
told me to level up a resistance and so
anyone who played Dark Souls will get
that that'll be a fun joke for everyone
and like listening to our audio during
that which was one of our first streams
was agonizing yeah you know and I'd like
to consider us professionals and we're
you know we are trying to make a quality
product here for people it's fine it's
fine everything everything's fine all
the time audio is fine yes audio is fine
now so many things to do I forgotten
what I've done inhabit time uh and I've
gotten good far you've gotten good far
church of the good chalice
what kind of interface are we using
we're using my zoom h6 which is just you
know a standalone audio recorder that I
have but the neat thing it does is I can
plug in all of these microphones because
it has four XLR inputs and I can
individually adjust the levels for each
of us which as we've talked about before
is really important with rich because he
has a super voice mm-hmm
and so we each have our own microphone
and I try to dial in our levels
correctly so that you know when rich
shrieks in terror and or delight he
doesn't he doesn't blow out everything
that's good I you know what I can I
can't find any of these people how are
you finding these people windows doors
all windows there's like a special red
lamp by the ones you can interact with
and some of them have people who might
be able to get back to the church sure
maybe I just don't talk to anybody
that's just me though what happened to
the elgato uh I had the elgato today and
rich wanted to start streaming without
me so he just he just started nobody
gives a fuck about the story of cares
about being and that's okay that's
really okay yes yes
Jack talked to everybody I am talking to
everybody what are you talking about
Jack is really lonely sometimes you know
sometimes but I think we all feel that
way sometimes
damnit the bagman pretty good at that
Perry yeah and you gotta be jack
it helps animist Prime I am specifically
talking to you
it's a hold of me Walsh
he says holy crap rich a lot of people
care about the story in these games it's
a whole debate really the story of this
game I I don't care no they give us
enough which is you know there are
demons and you've got a killer and then
they give us little glimpses you know
like the the zombie guys at the
beginning calling you the Beast the
other hunters that turn evil and you
have to fight there's this whole sub the
story thing that's happening where you
get to kind of fill in the pieces
yourself it's very nice they're handling
it correctly which is letting you figure
it out on your own
being alone is good sometimes as you
should what
I don't know what's that no that's a
thing we must have said something that
triggered like the use voice command oh
really oh don't don't say it again
I mean we must
so what you mean to say is that I get
their motivation yes I understand my
character's motivation in this 100% it's
to kill the people that are trying to
kill me yeah that's the easiest that's
the easiest motivation in the world and
I love it yeah I think it's too vague
for me to care about the story yeah
let's guys you're no other is that's
right fools Vern if you like it you can
dive into the story but it doesn't force
you to watch a bunch of shit that's
exactly what it is like there there are
times when I like watching a bunch of
shit I love your heroes oh right
but to put it in a game like this you
the player gets to dictate their own
pace and so if you want to learn more
about the story you can you have that
option and if you don't you don't have
to but you get to choose and so it's a
unique experience for everyone which is
what makes it wonderful it does look
like the gentleman ghosts from banner
goes it's a DC comic thing is it yeah
it's not like a Venture Brothers thing
oh maybe it is or maybe I'm thinking
about ghost robot I've only seen him in
Batman The Brave and the bold so it
might be like a lesser lesser DC thing
no red oh good Gold team I don't think
that story and video games is I think
that story in video games is completely
irrelevant to the art form but the way
in which the handle doling out of the
story that's that's what differentiates
a game from a movie and so when you in
your game when you have a cutscene
you're basically just saying well we're
not gonna be a game right now we're
gonna have a movie you can have a game
with a strong story you can have a game
that doesn't care about story you know
judge each case on a case by case basis
yes but having a story or not having a
story does not dictate to be our
everything's fine it's true
you know what it's really good movie
dicks needs your help you need to tell
us the plot to Dolomites I you know what
I can't remember Dolomites I don't have
to watch it again that's right you guys
were watching blaxploitation films disco
Godfather dolomite you've never seen
disco Godfather Oh Lulu what has you
done I hate those things right isn't
that isn't that another beautiful
element of the game though is you just
fought relatively unscathed two giant
skeleton with an axe and were you fine
but then a crow my kids love reading
comics yes we we go to the comic store
often we read comics a lot yeah we we
read a lot of comics and it's great for
them they're a bunch of kid comics that
we have now to the Captain Underpants
series of books we are burning through
at the moment great nothing but poop
jokes nothing but proven fart jokes
really great really great stuff Oh rich
I don't know if the chat has told you
what's worse than that
what's worse than that seven what what's
the worst possible thing you can imagine
coming out of five minutes
movie yeah movie might be better than
the game I'm dead serious you know what
you're probably right the only thing it
has going for it is creepy imagery no
and that would work in a movie as
opposed to a game where you're literally
doing nothing yeah yeah it's it's
perfect though I like if they're gonna
make a found footage movie and it's
gonna be like that's exactly what a
cynical indie game though yeah one was a
good hint so they pumped out three more
yep as quickly and as carelessly as they
could uh-huh they made a bunch of money
more more power to them right because
they made a bunch of money yep but
people need to be smarter they've really
you need to be smarter like the first
one could have been a fun funny like
side note you know but Noah then we have
okay fear the old blood
that's exactly it's it's exactly 100%
going to be a found footage movie
because that's that's what the game is
you know that's what they is that's what
the game is it's good yes it's going to
be a new paranormal activity absolutely
it's bit because those are super cheap
to produce it has a recognizable title
it makes perfect sense on paper which is
why I'm not surprised to be fair my
opinion on the making movie on that
actually went down after you said phone
footage so but that's what's gonna have
a show that's all paid oh you found the
forbidden words or another entrance to
the forbidden woods okay
yes unfriended did you see that movie
trailer that's the Skype horror movie oh
its timing I thought it follows was the
the Twitter horror movie no that's
supposed to be the good horror movie
it follows it's supposed to be like the
the really good indie horror movie and
then unfriended is the is the bullshit
Skype Twitter
you're right Joey Belladonna rich you
shouldn't go this way it's forbidden
rich doesn't seem to like it but I mean
you know it's gonna be a long night
oh snap indeed this guy when it comes to
video games story is a frilly scarf
I think gameplay is God when it comes to
video games story is a frilly scarf that
you wrap on as an extra and it doesn't I
mean they they both can exist in the
same in the same world yeah game playing
story going to cannon fit together and
have fit together nicely games but I
mean I also in general agree with you I
if I if I have to choose between a good
game and a good store good game playing
a good story it's always always gonna be
good game play I think I think a really
interesting or fun story can make up for
mediocre gameplay is not necessarily bad
game
I think that's silly hi laser face McCoy
hi hi there's so many places to go I
don't know what I've missed
oh no and they've already lost the
fucking Forbidden Forest
it is you will get lot you you'll be
nothing but loss it's an exploration
gold - well yes it can be frustrating
the Forbidden Forest I've gotten lost so
many times in here
that's a good yes you know this area a
lot because you're here who this is my
this is mildly exciting this game is a
lot more than mildly exciting pretty
darn exciting pretty darn exciting
nice jump stab yes have you um have you
tried like the combos with the switching
of the weapons stuff isn't Alex I don't
think they work as well with this shit
it doesn't it does not but it's still
pretty awesome yeah um just too big a
delay yes
Poe collects in the I wants to know if
I'm involved in space cop a little bit
I'm involved slightly I appear in space
cop and and I am I got this Terrence not
I it was the first thing I grabbed
that's the only thing that's up here
I'll make it work uh oh my god hello
check check Mike check
I can see the chat on my phone
technology aren't you special this is
amazing how do they do this Oh God what
I grunted dude why don't you just hit
your microphone oh maybe I grunted sweet
setup this this is pretty great it was
not a mugging it this is how a mic J
sounds perfect in December of 8 enemies
I think I realized what what my problem
was I was having nothing but trouble
with the Richard microphone rich is
poison to microphones for some reason
100% my fault I had the wrong mics
plugged into the wrong thing so I was
fiddling with your mic volume and you
have here so eventually just got suppose
like yeah every sounds alright
but by the way Rich's level was equal to
mine even though he had no mic anywhere
near him because rich is magic and
terrifying
yeah Rich's audio whenever we do
anything never makes any sense it's so
bizarre maybe I'm a ghost there's
something supernatural going on yeah
it's quite possible you hear ghosts
yeah Jay just upgraded from his flip
phone he's very excited
he had his uh his droid razr a joke I
don't over then rather the razor that
was like the first like Finn oh yeah
everyone had that ring someday I'll have
I need one you barely use your elbow I
said someday I'm in a rush what bothered
some people don't might be neat every
now and then
I can look at them out I'm my phone that
comes in handy a lot I don't have a lot
of useless apps on my phone I have stuff
that is actually helpful or that I use
regularly mm-hmm we record for you know
GPS or whatever yeah I'm gonna do how do
you do twitcasting what what what's a
toy multi-layered twitcasting what no
you don't do that what oh you do it on
the pad sharing oh when you're pon did
you tell you what a life twit stream why
are you meerkat what that's the thing
meerkat meerkat
that's a cat no it's a new thing oh is
the new like like vine and now there's
meerkat meerkat is live streaming from
your phone Twitter oh I have heard of
this yeah it's the new one it's the new
one it's probably a fail no I'm like no
it no it won't fail because it means
that you're constantly filming yourself
and people love to do that expose could
you press up X already why doesn't that
shit just go away on its own I would
love it for it to go away there's a
chance that's the same cat that's the it
is okay that's interesting
rich likes it on the TV okay which is
everybody
ah I agree I think that can be a plus
and a minus
Oh potentially well we'll see what
people think yes I agree there is a
there is a way we can do that through
through OBS put the chat in there but
then you know you have to make like the
game screen a little smaller now sure we
could do that a face cam news updates
and what song we're playing through
Spotify there's like a million little
apps that you can add to your screen oh
my god I know what's this modify a
horrible glory thank you for subscribing
we very much appreciate it also rich
reads Stardust thank you for subscribing
we've well I've never used Spotify
neither know is it's like Pandora or is
it something different it's something
different I mean I know it's not exactly
Pandora cuz it's got a different name
think of it more like Netflix for movies
where you could listen to whole albums
is what you listen to is it how big is
the library pretty big okay the assuming
they're ads in between songs or
something the no no you pay monthly oh
they don't have a free version like
Pandora knows well maybe they do it's
been a while okay it's been a while but
a lot of artists have been complaining
lately that they don't get oh yeah we've
got Taylor Swift's go after him and so
jay-z started his own
Spotify desk service just for his music
Ferno did like he just started his own
for all of him and his friends okay
artists in general I forget what it's
title thank you title is jay-z like
hobos and title people seem to like it
or they don't you know what I bet some
people like it sure and others they
don't like they just like it yeah and
then there are some people like me who
know nothing about it or a little enough
to tell Jay about it everyone wants
money it's true everyone wants money
does money get you thinks money gets you
things they don't actually want the
money what the things the money gets you
ah I I have no inherent love them small
green pieces of paper sure sure
but like the
the place I get to live in because of
those small green pieces of paper I well
I like I can cap the middle back half
this place to live without the small
pieces of paper I would be happy
hello Draco thank you for subscribing
will you very much a break Giada it's
like that famous line from the David
Mamet movie heist to this day I still
don't understand what the fuck it means
okay the line is everyone everyone wants
money that's why it's called money what
what does that mean we actually made fun
of that and Girl Interrupted like we
said when you're after the hookers scene
and you're like that really hit the spot
and uh these like hookers usually do
that's why they're called hookers I
think that was an intentional joke based
on the David Mamet film place that's a
really weird quote David Mamet has some
bizarre dialogue
oh it's around here this is where you
get to the thing with the Giants gonna
kill dogs in their cage the creepy dogs
and they will kill you let's say it
looks like a tiger it's like a zombie
dog okay so you say offer Tiger another
dog interesting J fact dragon aardvark
thank you for subscribing we very
appreciated I reached out to be a chatty
people I was trying a new thing on
Sunday it was supposed to collect a list
of all of our subscribers and so then
instead of thanking them as they
subscribe we could just like taking like
a break every half hour hour and be like
these are all the people that's which
seemed like a good idea the only problem
was it only listed it only catalogued to
new subscribers not people who were
researched out to them a little bit on
the Twitter's and whatnot and they said
they don't think there's a way to do
that there should be there should
someone get on this invent this there
should be a way but you'll make $2,000
we will pay you $5 well yeah we're
tipping lobby five bucks it's time what
are you talking about the some people
would like to know your thoughts and
some current events Oh having to do with
things that you enjoy but I don't enjoy
anything okay well then they go
especially not now that David Lynch left
Twinkies uh it's a sadness to quote
David Lynch it's a sadness oh I have a
feeling that he will be back do you
think I think so because there's been
nothing but negativity thrown at
Showtime since this all happened
worst case scenario he doesn't come back
for whatever reason all the scripts are
written him and Mark Frost wrote the
scripts oh so and it's not like he
directed every episode of the original
series directed the best ones and there
would be you know certain elements
missing if he doesn't do the new one
like the fact that
Bob character like the only reason that
character even exists is because they
were shooting a scene and they happened
to catch a crew member in the mirror and
it ended up in the episode and David
Lynch just spun that into it the whole
Bob thing is that true yeah bob was a
crew member he just happened to get
caught in the mirror in a scene and that
like the show went in a completely
different direction the most interesting
thing about it exists because of a
mistake and that's why David Lynch is
great because of things like that oh my
god that's brilliant that yeah that's
sort of like improvisational filmmaking
like that won't exist if he's not
directing new ones right but the basic
story will be there the scripts are
there I'm sure they will bring in
interesting directors that's worst-case
scenario it won't be as good of a show
but at least till they've had some
involvement um but I I think he'll be
back you think I think you would like to
think I would like to think I don't know
I don't think I think he he made a big
play as far as like announcing that it's
not happening and it's about money yeah
and I think that's a big enough play to
get out of it you know like why make
that announcement if if you think you
are in any way gonna be working with
these people again well I think it's a
power play because of Showtime issued a
statement shortly after that where they
were like we didn't even we didn't know
he was leaving we thought we were close
to coming to a final deal so him doing
that is like you need me
that's him his wife's like cuz he knew
how people would react sure something he
wasn't doing and obviously most of the
cast is behind him hi McLaughlin's been
very silent I think he may have already
signed a contract of some sort so he
can't say anything negative possibly I
don't know I'm sure but cuz everybody
else have a video out now or they're all
talking about it mmm oh they can't do
Twin Peaks without David Lynch more than
more than Twin Peaks I was just excited
the David Lynch was gonna be directing
something new right like it's you know a
bonus that it's twin
but it could be anything he directed
something new I would be excited a guard
list so I'm more bummed about that the
idea of him not directing something sure
sure
so I don't know we will see it seems
like everything is blown up at a really
expediate and rates where it's like just
playing others like hashtag save Twin
Peaks and there's like websites and
videos devoted to it and it's like no
one knows exactly what's going on really
it's all kind of vague which is probably
if if David Lynch was making the the you
need me play that's exactly what he
wants
no sure it's like a look at one look at
all the free publicity yeah
then I just gave you I friends it up
into you need me yeah yeah actor
interrupted thank you for subscribing oh
no this is rich playing I played the
last couple of streams now rich rich
coyotes
damn it was only fair that I get to
stream it is it is really tough
especially being this close to the
controller and you know we're gonna grab
it just knowing that I can't do this
and that's fine no that's fine by the
way I'm just yeah I'm here having a good
time ran the wires down and back here so
they're not all over the so that's
amazing long wires
yep is that is their key to it okay yeah
yeah I like this setup this is comfy
mm-hmm
also yes we all saw
than Robert Siddhartha's bad rest and
peace rest in peace he's interesting
because I saw I posted the original
article about him passing away and it's
like man these are some really
unflattering pictures they're using for
this article and then I realized that
it's that's just because pictures of
Robert cigar what-have-you some older
sister richelieu they're saying you
missed an important item in a house back
at that village place really what
village place the village place is urine
so there's an important item
I watched Maniac Cop to the night Robert
Siddarth died Oh tonight I found out
Maniac Cop 2 is amazing yeah and you
know I I did not my first time ever
seeing Robert sad aren't anything I
think was samurai cop yeah you know most
people I think knowing his biggest movie
was Tango in cash
oh she was one of the bad guys in that
which I've never seen I've never seen
tango and cash so I feel like I should
see it it's Kurt Russell come on oh and
here's the thing I have seen tango Akash
and I just don't remember a minute I
like but yeah that was like a gonna take
us when we go which building huh
which building Chad oh maybe they were
trying to get you to fall
who said that
what am I missing
I'm watching I'm watching for it but you
know the saddest part was I saw someone
posted an article that was saying that
his family was having trouble raising
the money oh yes I see and it's just
like that's sad that's that for any yeah
but I say as some people mentioned
samurai cop - I don't think it's gonna
affect the productions that movie much
cuz I doubt he would have been in in
much of the movie right was he gonna be
in it and any of it yeah he's gonna be
in it I have a feeling it was just gonna
be like a cameo type thing sure cuz he
but he wasn't yet I I don't know if they
shot us I'm assuming they didn't shoot
herself on the on the upper path there's
they're talking about the poison cave
him I'm I'm actively avoiding them fifty
thousand blood echoes that's a suicide
trip
mister shy smile is wanting to know if
you would like him to tell you a short
cut about a short cut yeah sure go for

strength look in your inventory what is
that - oh sorry
I'm just curious who did you get a new
gym Oh
oh it's a buying thing where I saw it up
there
nope no back there tonsil stone oh oh
it's a key oh it opens something up it
opens up a new area that's the most
exciting thing I get to go someplace and
do it's weird it's it's a game that
makes you excited to walk around in the
game it's a cool looking game and by the
way like to notice you know Richards
been playing for a while on the same
life and you just notice how he's all
covered in blood doesn't go away oh
that's great it'll tell you until you
leave the world it doesn't go away oh
nice and and like now he's good like the
bottom of his thing is gonna be like
caked in the goop of all this it's
really great that's that's wonderful a
great little visual representation of
how long you've been playing who told me
about that
they had a very long name with X's and
4:20 in it
thank you that person if I see their
name again I will make sure to thank
them no I don't think the chat window
can be resized I think that's just the
size it is there it is xxxx legit 420
noscope x-axis thank you thank you for
that tip rich very much appreciates it
and I do too cuz I'm gonna go home and
do that too
I am you know what I'm putting this out
there I'm a silly billion that happens
oh my god oh oh you know you can come
from the other side of five-year-olds
and grandparents say silly Billy oh
that's cool oh I thought you meant were
referencing the song from the stupids
it's in the stupids it's not from the
same guys I I know I'm sad that I know
that that song is in the movie with
students because that means that I've
seen yep you know who directed the
stupidest John Landis yeah you might as
well know it's a long way down for John
Landis I mean I'm sure he got paid I
would imagine he did I doubt he directed
that for Freeman every time that man
goes to sleep he sees decapitated
children
he let me have some hits after that
accident like people think that's what
killed his career but after that was
like coming to America coming to America
was great and won at least one other big
head I mean I'm sure that didn't help
his career at all but he did do some big
stuff still after that happened the
beggar know here behind the cannon up
there where that glowy thing is yeah cuz
Niedermayer from Animal House whatever
that actor's name is he's in the stupids
yeah oh he's a local guy yeah um mark
mark Metcalf mark red Gavin he came into
the hardware store a couple times when I
worked there yeah
and I was like obviously I wasn't like
starstruck but when he left I was like
hey this the guy from Animal House
pretty cool and nobody else cared the
guy from Animal House and the we're not
going to take it music video yes yes
which is more bharden and you gotta go
in the bill and he was the maestro on an
episode of Seinfeld oh that's right
that's right
Mary's a solid character actor I love an
animal house rich alicia's thank you for
subscribing we very much appreciate it
yeah no I think they're like he's had
some few minor roles here there that's
kind of nice
richer wishes rich elation
all right we're were worse than that
yeah oh no no somewhere out here but
it's in here
yeah missing yeah and like the cannons
up there like you have to climb up and
then like strategically drop down on
things you have to you have to do two
platforming maybe that maybe it sounds
around
this is familiar yeah drop down on that
okay you know what open up open up some
open you already feel my water you can
have a pair if you would like oh my god
someone just asked about the Scientology
documentary I haven't seen it is it out
yet
Oh going clear yeah it's like a tell-all
about Scientology that's great
uh yeah I'm curious about it I don't I
didn't know it was out if it is I want
to hear more about those crazy scientist
and her stupid wrong ideas I hope
there's a whole section of the movie
devoted to Battlefield Earth oh it's uh
name is on okay I will check it out
there's a shortcut I can open up in this
building it's not check that might be
the other building that looks just like
that building Oh
oh it's not on Amazon it's on HBO oh
yeah that doesn't help me think you're
right yeah oh you mean like the elevator
shortcut right by the yeah that would be
a really nice thing to get oh well I'll
get the very first get the beggar and
get the candidate
that'd be kid never mind no I don't want
to I don't care I don't want a backseat
game yeah it's Parrish pear oh my god I
should have backseat game cuz I was
gonna warn you about him I'm sorry yeah
well yeah I did you almost died I know I
did because I didn't want a backseat
game man I would have taken you a long
time to get there yeah and what a very
far away so rich is collecting in the
top right corner do you see that sixty
one thousand four hundred name yeah
those are blood echoes and that's
basically your currency in the game you
use that to upgrade stuff okay and if
you die you drop all of them you then
can try to make it back to them and you
can pick them up if you can make it back
to them but they disappear if you die
again before you get there yes and given
how challenging the game is it's
sometimes you lose sometimes you lose
so that quarter a little bit too fast
slow and easy
now wait look down might not appear I
want to say I don't know if it's in here
if it's like a different area check this
out first yeah this is exciting
oh it's totally up here but yeah the
bigger is what all the can of cannons in
here yeah did the bedroom before he
dropped down okay yeah do it well I play
witcher 3 when it's out yeah i don't
know what's the witcher game maybe
probably action I get to bring aboard I
started playing the first one I handed
yeah i know ii was supposed to be a lot
better but i still rich like before I'm
more of an actor hammer guy well you can
kill that I know I know you shouldn't
save this guy but I'm going to kill him
after I say this because I hear you get
it a lot of blood echoes for murdering
him hmm
I didn't even know you could murder
these people until I accidentally did it
one time and I got a really Swick 'add a
wicked ass blood gem I was really
excited about it for which the the old
guy that points you to the lake for the
spider oh oh really yeah you got a
wicked blood Jim
okay so now fart around and like look
down it's somewhere we're or is that it
did you already fall down one boom
everything we need here nice wicked Ford
with a sweet wicked thordan cuz that's
what I wanted to say I wanted to say
sweet wicked Swick it's a new word yeah
somebody added to the urban dictionary
that's like wicked wicked wicked why not
it's thicket what it's cricket cricket
you gotta know what a crumpet is to
understand cricket damn dog taking it
back probably not I have not beaten the
game no and I don't think I'm close but
also I am in general a notoriously slow
gamer like I don't I don't push through
stuff right now I am wilfully exploring
I'm backtracking just to look for shit
we've done
progress wise I am to the third
gravestone and have made some decent
progress but I I don't even think I'm
close to the end which I'm really happy
about
I started a new character because I
hated my specs mmm I suspect wrong and
so I'm a little further back than why
I've gotten to the Blood Moon okay I
beat the spider round I didn't get much
further past that oh okay oh here it is
then you can do stuff like this which is
like you know rich has been out just out
in the wild for so long but now he's
found a shortcut to get back to the
place where you respawn but you can only
open it from one side to have to go like
all the way around but then you can open
it so the next time you're you respawn
you can get there much faster I'm gonna
cash in the package yeah you probably
have a couple like blood thingies - guys
I want to buy something yep oh yeah I
got killed by the at listen everybody
got killed by that first bag man the
first and everyone saw the bag man in
there first time I won't ruin it for you
but the first time you see that bag man
you will shit your pants that's not
that's supposed to be there yes you you
get far enough in the game and it starts
randomly replacing enemies with these
enemies called bag men I don't know if
it's random maybe it's not random but
it's you don't expect it like it's like
oh I'll go kill this enemy I know where
it's a bag man and clean my chair bags
on their head so they call back sack
filled with something okay so um over
there back but you don't know what they
swing at you okay yeah I bet it's human
body parts oh that's what's in that bag
I bet you're right it's great is what it
is this game is full of great nope we're
not playing The Last of Us not gonna
happen at all
what is that there's a game it's a game
that rich and I are not playing okay so
why are you so against playing it it is
heavily scripted it is miss story
notoriously more story focused and one
of those and we've recently had some
issues with some game focused
I've been wedged into the story didn't
look obnoxiously schmaltzy yeah yeah
it's a little girl it's Oscar Oscar bade
the game yes it's about a little girl
losing her innocence in the mushroom
zombie apocalypse mushroom zombies
they're not they're not zombies it's a
fungus and so they all have like little
mushroom head things but I mean they're
zombies okay we're not we're not gonna
play we're most likely not going to
enjoy it
so why it's why did I miss one muscley
Native American thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it and thank you
dick neutron pointing out
playing a dangerous game rich why do you
have your torch out oh that's what I'm
that's why I'm not sure it yep that's
why I'm a student
we figured it out rich was failing
because he messed up messing up usually
does result in failure mmm rip his guts
out so what's the story well what's the
don't care you're a vague it's vague
literally vague mmm in the opening
sequence a very awful looking man is
replacing your blood with some sort of
other substance and then you're telling
your told your you're hunting you're a
hunter and you just go out and you fight
monsters yeah okay they're vague hints
and story things but there's nothing
that's I've seen that's really concrete
on what's going on and what you have to
do the Senate is voting on the vote
there was something you were talking
about before were you just saying like
there's no like you must return the
crystal chalice to the tree of Everwood
no there's no bullshit like that okay
you killed the things that are trying to
kill you and that's it all right it's
great it's great there's there's no and
there's no like there's no like mini
objectives
you know like in some games it'll be
like in this area you must you know yeah
dude this thing that there's it
literally never tells you anything you
just walk until you find more things to
murder like these giant poison things
yeah be smart some cool creatures in
this yes there are I love this costume
oh yeah go with the poison fruit
costumes also be careful you might be
sneaking up on you okay okay
no no there are quests there are quests
in the game but they don't give you
quests you have to figure out what the
quest is you know which is the great
thing about it like there are things to
do but it never tells you what to do
sure does
oh you got
about his guts
nice nice place
the fungus in the last of us are called
cordyceps which is a real-life fungus
that gets into the brain of ants and
then uses their body like a car in a
real life holy shit that's awesome
causes the ants to climb up really high
I'm like a bird and it's like I'm like a
blade of grass or something you really
don't know I don't know and then they
died and the fungus sprouts out of their
head and holy shit that's amazing that's
crazy
so that's what the fungus from the last
of us is based on okay that's fine I
mean they're still zombies that's like
when people get upset like butts I've
got like 28 days later yeah they're not
zombies sir affected living there
they're zombies they're essentially
zombies not even essentially yeah
finest fuck if it's if it's a generic
third-person shooter large stretches I
don't want to play right now if it's a
generic third-person shooter with with
little in the way of enemy variety I've
no interests at all no interest also the
developers of the game are I've made
some other things that I don't much care
for baby I haven't played any of the
Uncharted games to be fair but I haven't
because they look kind of dull oh it
looks like bad platforming and bad
shooting that's you you you haven't what
might be a very fun action adventure
story grafted onto it but it looks like
very bland shootings and very bland
blood for me yes I'm not interested and
most generic like most generic foe
Indiana Jones story imagine of all you
know Nathan Drake just gonna get rich
he's the thief with the heart of gold
it's it's not terrible it's bland I'm
not gonna call it terrible it's very
bland
she runs run run run Oh
rich you would love it with large cabin
is their extremely generic third-person
shooting and extremely generic
platforming was it in blend for stealth
sections mmm here's and lots of lots of
linear corridors where the scripted
story takes place Oh any of these things
true I bet there's a corridors I here's
here's what I'm gonna say
does the exploration involve in walking
down the hallway where there's the one
door you can open here's here's what I
want to say I'm going to change our not
gonna play it to maybe one day because
maybe that'll make them shut up mm-hmm
people are saying no to a lot of this
rich maybe you shouldn't be so quick to
judge I'm gonna be quick to judge
because I want to I don't
sometimes you don't wait to go through
the light sometimes you have to use your
past experiences to inform your future
decisions that's how things work that's
how humans evolved
or you put your Thord into a bigger
Thord and it's a bigger thorn oh there's
a secret over here many people are
saying listen to Jake I don't even know
what we're talking about but that's okay
no way don't go there anymore run to run
back really first of all this dump
why is it done well cuz you lost health
because if you could have climbed out oh
that guy gives you stuff you see that
creepy little skeleton guy he's kind of
pros are trying to kill him why don't I
stop and look around that's a good idea
jack he's gonna run away well he shows
up randomly he doesn't hurt you
yeah that is my crocodile brain
understand there is a there's a secret
back well next time you died back back
by yeah next time you die there's a
secret by by the bottom of the elevator
the pretty sweet secret no actually I
don't even know what's there
the secret is sweet the the I don't know
if the item is any good I forget whether
or not the item is worth it but the
movie the item no it's not worth it yeah
it's Aaron I saw like the moment you
realized what I was talking about there
is that some Oh Mary you didn't and then
BAM well it was like it was it took me a
couple times like well such a generic
title right we stream so late at night
cuz sometimes we work during the day and
there's not that wait for us right I'm
sorry that it's 4:00 a.m. in Europe
that's not our fault I really do
apologize but this is you wanna if you
want to pay all of us first-class
tickets to England and then put us up
with like a hotel and then get it rent
us out some studio space while we're
there
mm-hm and and just throw out a week for
us and we'll we'll stream from your
always so you only you can't just stream
in a different time here I mean we could
you have to go to Europe to do it so we
have to do this for some other guy
no we wait why is his way more important
than ours
you would want to do a suspicion or
European friendly streams you've done
that before anything you do the Super
Bowl we did that for the Super Bowl we
did a European friendly stream Andy and
I want to say it was successful and so
we will be doing more European friendly
streams but you know we're trying to
stay with the schedule and this is the
schedule it works for us and I'm sorry
that it doesn't but we will try
them's them's the brakes can or them's
the brakes thing I mean either way
either way you wanna play that free
record a stream has been stream it live
during European time
oh my god so that would be they
previously recorded previously recorded
live but not live only if we change our
names to ban it good
I saw someone mentioned Twin Peaks I
already talked about it I'm gonna get
her earlier folks they don't know him I
can't talk about it anymore it's too
depressing yeah I did not know that they
already had scripts it yeah so the whole
thing is scripted but if Lynch was
directing the likely change as it went
along and evolve and get weird right it
wouldn't stick to the script as he were
just written and not directed anything
besides Twin Peaks like his even written
and not directed a movie has he written
a movie that he didn't direct that no
that's the question he's written he
wrote at least one book which I have not
read okay called catching the big fish
um but no he's never written something
that he didn't do it okay cuz yeah he
wrote twin peaks' episodes that he did
not direct yes
I'm fine need more discussion about
sweet potatoes listen I got a snack the
other day at the grocery store it's
sweet potato chips no salt added no
preservatives or anything into sweet
potato chips and they're delicious so
that's our sweet potato talking I in
general dislike sweet potatoes they're
great this is literally all we can
muster I don't know I haven't spent too
much time down here cuz I got scared I
got scared and ran away
really yeah I do like this is where I'm
heading next though because I want to
unlock the path back to the clinic and
this is how you do it
unlocking that main gate
I haven't spent too much time down here
but I think I think my hatred of sweet
potatoes it comes from an early
Thanksgiving early in my life
Thanksgiving okay in which I did not
know what sweet potatoes were and so I'm
so good or sorrows but what I did was I
mixed them with my regular potatoes Oh
mix them together then you put great
like just thinking like Oh fun orange
potatoes I realizing that they have a
completely different taste absolutely
and so it's just one of those things
where it was worse because my brain was
expecting something else that'll happen
oh there was a ladder there apparently I
I wanted to fully explore the bottom
first
okay I know I even know where it goes oh
there you go
I don't know why rich was just hanging
out inside the poison just farting
around that's what you do sometimes I
don't I don't hate your opinions but
sometimes y'all that snooty about being
European when you're acting snooty about
being American rich
oh my banks do you know paying a murder
by being snooty about them yeah you're
Devlin up on this news I'm not I'm not
the one saying them they're watching the
wrong football I think that should just
fury aids me Shep blowing out your ass
i watch the exciting football you can
watch the boring one another down the
elevator I don't care about that I'm
focused on a different thing entirely
different I just want to show you
something cool shut up rich doesn't like
things that are cool or anything for
that matter
that's true are you alright what was
this a great mazing thing go down the
thing it's just gonna be like a fucking
skeleton that's just sitting there in
day she's gonna be a scale up to sit
there the quarry exam that cool fuck
Jimmy let's go it'll be wearing
sunglasses no it's okay I'm gonna have
to take it take a right okay now keep
going right okay now drop down there now
oh there's a guy to fight and a thing a
gory thing over here where did you get
on oh yeah there it is my first time
around okay I didn't know by the way I
didn't know that you could just walk
over that thing I had to like you know
cuz they do run and hit the the dodge
but you jump so I thought it was like a
neat thing where it's like you never
have to use a jump button but now
they're makes trick but apparently it
wasn't his twin blood song he doesn't
well I thought the jumping thing was
cool hundred I thought the jumping thing
but you didn't have to do this right
over there's no jumping well it didn't
take you very long get some more blood
is that true when you do the visceral
attacks your hand it turns into a claw I
can't see I can't see that's what
someone just said you do you like you
never go in with your weapon though you
do reach in with your hand so that's
neat
I think that's neat
you know what I'm gonna get some more
entirely different from what yeah I keep
trying to find a way up this thing
because there's a secret doodad up there
up there I don't know I don't know how
to get up there though on the outside
there's a glowy thing I can't find a way
up no that would be easy whoa
I'm hella drank oh I'm sure Jay
appreciates you giving him all the
things
hello drink oh I'm never gonna talk
about anything ever that you suggest
from now on never again even if it's
something we're talking about hello
Draco you blew it
and yeah I do plan on watching the
daredevil Netflix original that's coming
out soon man I'm a Marvel fan boy I'm
gonna watch this shit they make you know
what I rewatched last night I don't know
why I just felt like watching it I
watched the first Iron Man movie yeah
it's great it is it feels so quaint now
like compared to everything else come
since that's so simple that was the
beginning I still have problems with the
third act but the first like hour that
movie oh well it's like two hours long
so the first hour and a half is really
great yeah no I know you hate fact that
movie up until that is this character
thing yeah and then Jeff Bridges just a
medium that has a larger I've got a
bigger Iron Man suit here's my question
how would you and Emily oh god I could
or should they have done different I
don't know that would require a lot of
thought my god I don't know I think I
thought they were related the movie was
so clever up until then and that's like
the least clever thing possible you can
still have your big you know slam-bang
action and Dean I just didn't think any
of the action in that part was
particularly good okay probably probably
if they set up some sort of bigger
rivalry between them or some sort of
like knowledge rivalry he tried to have
him killed what I'm saying you tried to
have him killed him it was pretty basic
plain motivation like I want your
company it's a superhero movie yes there
are no Marvel care oh sure I'm fine with
Jeff Bridges motivation as a villain hmm
I just thought the action got kind of
generic
that point I agree but it still is Jeff
Bridges in a giant robot suit his
character's name is Obadiah Stane yes I
have seen all those shots of Ryan
Reynolds in the Deadpool outfit yeah
that's good I haven't seen any of that
stuff the movie might be bad I'm
mentally prepared for it to be a bad
movie I don't care how who's like
directing or is there anything anything
yeah I don't know I mean no no it's
filming right now like we know it okay I
haven't been paying attention huh Ryan
Road this is you know a very big passion
project for Ryan Reynolds hmm he really
was upset how they handled his character
in The Wolverine Origin movie I see it's
the same actor yeah is he a big Deadpool
fan or something like I think I didn't
care there was there were a lot of fans
Jay yeah okay I just Ryan Reynolds
doesn't strike me as like a comic-book
guy but I guess I don't know much about
him I don't know if he was a comic book
guy maybe he's just like maybe when he's
signed on to that movie he thought he
was gonna get to do more like maybe the
script changed halfway through and so
it's just maybe it's just an actor thing
where he's like no this character was
supposed to be a certain way his movie
sucks
I can do better I swear everybody shots
yeah yeah put me in coach yeah and I in
general really enjoy Ryan Reynolds he's
fine he's fine
he's he had he's a one-trick pony but
man does he do that trick well if you
are looking for the fast-talking smarmy
guy with a heart of gold man you get
Ryan Reynolds in there way better than
Bradley Cooper video no have you seen
the Deadpool angels no okay there's a
Deadpool April Fool I don't go on the
internet on April Fool April Fool's
it's a good idea Mario Lopez
interviewing Ryan Reynolds and talking
about how the movies gonna be pg-13 and
they're kind of like making excuses for
it sure when when Deadpool just walks
like behind the camera behind Mario
Lopez he grabs like a printer walks the
other side and then he just bashes Mario
Lopez over the head with a printer they
say of course the movies gonna be our
rating fucker something like that that's
not the exact oh that's great that will
be our mated of course Deadpool I gotta
say it a comic book movie that's r-rated
that is a little surprising mm-hmm cuz I
mean there's been a few but they always
bomb well this is this is kind of oh oh
you're going to a real new area
oh are you gonna get the Lightning gun I
got really scared of the bad man because
remember I haven't been using Perry so I
just avoid the bagman these are the
bagman - okay they're creepy is a
fucking plane Grim Reaper's
I don't know like I don't have any
feelings towards Deadpool in general
he's always been kind of a joke
character okay I know next to nothing
about him he his comic fourth-wall
breaking yeah wow that dark humor he
appears as a satire mostly to other
comics and I'm okay with that so I don't
know how perhaps he will perhaps he will
shit perhaps he will shit oh god that's
the great oh my god yeah yeah run away
Wow
yeah they're great perhaps this will be
a wonderful action comedy satire of
modern-day superhero movies okay if the
movie holds true to comic form that
would be amazing
there's like an entirely CGI yes pretty
good that that was actually that's
what's led to the movie be made right
cuz I got leaked on YouTube or something
and reports are that it was Ryan
Reynolds that leaked it oh okay
like you know just get that hype going
huh
but I have no allegiance Nellie just a
dead ball I have not seen literally I
have not seen any Avengers two trailers
that's not one cuz I know I'm gonna see
it so I don't care about trailers yeah
yeah it's best to go in blind mmm I know
nothing about it and I'm really excited
the first teaser trailer lights I'm sure
it's gonna be funny but I'm not you're
not hyped free for just like an okay
action movie like no I mean I'm it's not
like I'm not looking forward like I'm
you know like oh now I gotta see the
Avengers like I'm gonna see it I'm sure
it'll be fun but I'm not like super
excited okay I'm with you
to me it's like we had the you know all
the Marvel movies we have to lead up to
the Avengers we had the Avengers movie
that to me is like that's the big you
know that's the big moment I want to
point out something about this game okay
you know I wasn't that forbidden yeah
look I'm an entirely different area and
I'm still exploring new ground yeah
isn't that great I think so in that
grade can you do that The Last of Us how
do you do that completely different
atmosphere completely different monsters
some difference well and I'm still gonna
make progress in the game while I do it
yeah infinitely bright I know but isn't
that a completely different type of game
though wouldn't it be like saying that
disappointed that this drama movie isn't
funnier I'm just trying to genuinely
eske's I don't know any guys think
though that last what sounds like a kind
of game I'm just okay
the real idea I have not come across
this yet great the real idea is national
many games lack run and so the last of
us might be an okay story it might even
be a decent game but as you play the
game again and not miss because maybe
all the enemies what's the same maybe at
the environment out and so here is a
game that does a great job of changing
even though the mechanicals never change
you're fighting the same way the first
five minutes you're fighting different
fighting different things in the areas
that's kind of that was
you're fighting a lightening werewolf
that's great
yeah and I'm dead that'll do it he toss
you under the ground
look glitchy little glitchy every now in
the game either was unintentional and
then they're gonna put his gravestone
right there because he's already very
very good
no we have not played the last those we
might play it we have to say that
because we're making assumptions based
on based on me
the trailers based on everything they've
shown us they haven't shown me anything
that's made me go WOW I need to play
that yes when I see that I'll give a
shit
until then yes yes everything's fine
mostly all the time
it looks small see the people who made
Uncharted the boring third-person
shooter not sold nice my should be Oh
yep yes they're very good at killing me
oh and they don't look like they should
be you know they're you know like
hunchbacked old ladies but man they they
jump injuries they sure is what is
schmaltz stop using old man words isn't
it old man word schmaltz as it is a
common phrase it's a very common word
maybe you need to expand your vocabulary
no Smackdown yes what what do you people
of course we are judging a game before
you play it should you buy everything
before you decide we're not you want to
buy it is that others first once once
again new the reason humanity has
evolved
now is because we use past experiences
to evaluate future decisions
maybe I should eat this green leaf
everyone else seems to have died what
eating this green wait but you know what
I won't know until I try I will say it's
like with videogames they're unlocked
like I can say you know I really the
thing I can relate this to is news right
I go see many bad movies but they're a
lot less expensive than buying a
brand-new game pensive time comes oh
yeah games are time-consuming and
expensive yeah
what can understand being more picky but
do you think for example the column Oh
God right you have already made
assumptions about a cop absolutely
you've not seen I have not seen the
cobbler but using your mighty human
brains you can understand the elements
that are involved in that and put
together a rough idea what to expect
yes that's true the cobbler by the way
is the new Adam Sandler that's another
one that's coming out is another movie
we can make
it's true it's real add or no but movies
are also I'm gonna do it also cheaper
than video yes oh my god oh my god
I done that was like nothing no nothing
you didn't fucking nothing
you are the trophy congratulations
people are mentioning boyhood that's the
exact opposite where it's like based on
the trailers based on the directors
previous films I thought I was really
going to enjoy boyhood mom and then it
didn't go that way that's true there you
go you never know it could happen both
ways
yeah it can happen both ways rich Evans
monster killer that's right if you want
to we have a prereq Steam account
previously recorded dot R LM at gmail if
you would like to steam gift us games
you can give this bad email address I
assume that you also have access to the
account because you do
listen this is your bad spot yeah I mean
that's a big victory we killed a
lightning werewolf I'd be ready to call
it quits on life if I ever did that
right never gonna top that I'm gonna
jump off a bridge and I'll die no one is
the guy that killed the lightning
werewolf he killed the lightning
werewolf and jumped off a bridge we
don't know why he jumped off of them
bridge we were ready to hand him all of
the money fame in the door killing that
lightning many book deals here were all
of these women and men throwing
themselves at him and we just jumped off
a bridge it's really quite frustrating
for us it just makes the mystery it
makes its story all the more interesting
she's heard about story I I hadn't heard
about can't become of years ago but I
had heard about it to like do days ago
aloud what's your name ELISA Lam was a
woman they found what was up a hotel
right okay and I know what a hotel is
people started complaining about the
water being like sickly sweet and and
sometimes black and they went and
checked the water tanks on the top of
the hotel it's a dead girl floating
around oh where was this at some hotel
in LA I believe Oh 20 20 odd year old
Canadian girl was on vacation and then
I'm dead in a was she murdered and
shudders here's the thing a locked water
tower on top of the tank with an alarm
on it
she managed a drone in there they they
called it a suicide
oh my god there's footage creeping at
you more creepily there's security cam
footage over like a last known footage
of her she's in an elevator acting
extremely strange mm she walks in the
elevator and then for one the elevator
doors just don't close for some reason
but she looks confused about that
mention walks in out of the elevator
then she walks back in and then she's
like ducks in the corner of the elevator
all takes place there for like four or
five minutes oh my walks out of the
elevator she serves her like like this
weird thing with her hands her hands are
flopping around she's just got a shaking
this is creepy as shit and then she's
and then she walks away that's the last
known footage of this woman who
mysteriously appeared inside of a locked
water tower on top of the hotel Wow
maybe she was a mutant and she was
getting her mutant powers of
teleportation but she didn't know how to
use it correctly so she ended up inside
a water tank yeah so completely fucked
up story yeah very interesting
did you hear ya that's creepy
that is it's very creepy but that's you
know that's why Nightcrawler needs to
know a building layout before they go on
a mission so he doesn't end up in a
water tower it doesn't end up in a water
tower sure
her name was ELISA Lam yeah yeah no
people are linking to the video of it oh
my god
oh don't watch the video and that it
would creep me the fuck out yeah I think
I'm well I'm gonna use my blood it goes
that I'm gonna say yeah my priorities
straight
it's cute good I make it happen
that's a that's a good question was
there a movie that you ended up really
enjoying that had a very bad trailer I
don't that much yeah boy I don't know
I'm sure there has been I can't think of
anything any any movie before 1990 you
had an awful trailer that's true the
trailers
thank you sure sure Ghostbusters makes
ghostbusters look like crap yeah it's
fucking ghostbusters yeah a deist
trailers are kind of bad yeah I don't
know I can't think of anything I can
tell you the most amazing trailer I've
ever seen was for Buffalo 66 I don't
even remember the trailer for that I
liked that movie yellow yeah fucking
hate them I can I can understand that
yes but I like that movie anyway
I by the way I am NOT surprised to go
but I like that movie yeah one of the
greatest trailers of all time it's cut
to yeses heart of the sunrise okay which
is this like amazing like mathy prog
rock song probably seen this trailer and
I can't remember it it's the greatest
trailer in the history of trailers it
gets you so pumped to see the movie and
then yeah well that's that's a movie
that's made for trailer images yes that
whole movie is just really breathtaking
images more than anything I really know
and then you cut it to this song and the
song is like kind of all over the place
and you stuttery and jittery and they
cut it to the beats and now beautiful
editing and the movie I was so bored
with yes heart of the sunrise yes in
general is an amazing band if you enjoy
that kind of hard up the sunrise heart
of the sunrise
I'm not familiar maybe I have a nice
tone I think once you hear it bow cap
you've you've probably heard it it's the
song in them I think the songs in the
movie too isn't it
pretty sure that I'm middle it's coming
back to me the trailer a little bit I
think it's a song that's in the movie
but it could be he's okay yes yes you
are
he's chart could I am so curious about
his tire now we have Ishtar on blu-ray
here we have the director's cut of
Ishtar eventually you will probably
watch it we've probably not for a show
cuz it's gonna be an okay movie I
grandma's guarantee it
it's just a notorious flow and the
trailer is incredibly dumb the trailers
not that great now but I I'm very
interested in seeing Ishtar one of these
days yeah I don't think we would ever do
it for like best of the worst cuz it's
not gonna be laughably bad right I'm
just a racing school oh you did miss the
rifle spear I got on my last run it's
missing now not a big deal about it yeah
two weapons that are pretty decently
level I don't want to use that my
completely unleveled I didn't oh yeah no
and I agree this you find again a mild
frustration I have is you know you find
that one maybe two weapon and tactic
that works for you and you don't feel
like you want to branch out with other
weapons we're pausing the stream
actually can I pause it on the
PlayStation rather just in the stream
and then we come back I have no idea
okay well the stream is ending but the
stream the stream shall return okay
Oh what oh no our microphone is being
broadcast yeah but this is not

[Part III]
why is this a thing Elmo is that you
rich
apparently earlier Rich's microphone was
uh was giving him chipmunk voice no I
don't even know how to do something like
that where you sped up it's one of those
things where the zoom has two different
weight transfer rates 24,000 per second
and 48 kilohertz kilohertz okay and so
if it was set to the other thing maybe
it didn't mesh with 24,000 in 48 those
are the two things well I would love to
take credit for you singing like a chip
home I can
yes we are screaming well here's a
question that I just saw in the chat
jack did you know hit the street down
yeah kind of like garbage
no what's plastic and fake video if
you're gonna if you're gonna make a big
big spiel about doing the HD super HD
version of grand theft auto 5 on the new
consoles you do it right do it right
apparently the music in this opening
sequence which by the way
by tangerine dream Oh piqued my interest
rich has no sound ethereal and dreamlike
thank you for letting it loose
the PlayStation 3 version was bitter
well we well whatever it just seems like
a lazy poor wickets don't complain you
stole this from Jordan well
well fuck you I mean I was just I was
just the way they hype this I was
expecting like a huge boost take
advantage of the new systems looks like
they just poured it over Owen which is
directly straightly twitchplayspokemon
is saying that they downgraded the
graphics with the recent patch to make
it run smoother
right
no we we have never gotten so drunk
while filming best of the worse than we
had to take a break in sober up now
forward we don't get it we don't get
drunk daddy
I have a couple times not very often
which one I get really drunk you can't
get too drunk or you can't have a
discussion I'd also remember that like
we're setting up lights yeah yeah you
have to keep track of technical stuff
audio stuff so we just we can't get too
strong
what we would need will do to a group of
designated driver because it here here P
oh that's yeah the Halloween one that
was pretty drunk yeah I was drinking
well I actually just because we kept
drinking after I have the hollow wine
and then we were drinking after that oh
and that's cuz we didn't have to go
anywhere because we were staying
overnight in the Haunted Mansion it's
right the most reason it's okay because
we still yeah but yeah but in general
you want to be able to have a discussion
you want to 20 comments right you get
too drunk that's not happening perhaps
one day everyone's drunk just to see
what happens and we tried to do a
commentary track where we got completely
drunk and we abandoned it because it was
horrible I think it was Howard the Duck
gonna get super drunk and it was like a
horrible disaster so he never shoot
I work for food person and I want to
walk out eternity look it's like I care
about the driving and the exploration
right Thank You ppreciate I said I have
not yet early on in the stream we're
talking about getting
five is Genesis game boy advance and
doesn't have like an HDMI output HDMI
outputs great great and connectors for
all the original control
I don't hold enough because there there
is a lag come on it's not console there
is a lag and then there is a yeah and
it's I mean it's millisecond you know
like it's nothing
but when you're playing like and it
needs it then you have problems and so
I've been researching it and apparently
they're they're working to fix that and
there are there were they're doing some
workarounds so really what I'm looking
at now is older tube televisions hook up
the real common stupid we have some yeah
of course we have old tube TV series I
think some of them even work yep and so
and there there are Z's like there are
these perfect televisions that are doing
at the end of the tube air that are
giant but still all the old hardware in
them so you can get that perfectly
lagless
Oh God I had one I had yeah it was given
to me by someone that upgraded to an
HDTV and it was the heaviest fucking
thing we landed but we drank it upstairs
this is my apartment and I was like I
want to get rid of this immediately so I
put it on Craigslist someone took it
because like I don't even want this in
my place yeah and like I scoured
Craigslist every once in a while I
checked like the market for the it's
like a particular brand of Sony
television just perfect yeah it was the
one that I had it was it was a flat
screen quote-unquote like it was trying
to look like a HD TV because those were
you know starting to become more popular
but it was an old two television I was
so fucking heavy
yeah mr. glitch that's it the the Sony
FV 300 is like the the model that people
where it's like just and you can get one
in like 32 inches at the time was huge
so game game do need to be turned down
in the chat is that what you won it's
quite possible you I don't think you've
messed with the audience you had stirred
it down for blood-borne yeah it's turn
it down for blood lock turn down for
blood lock what did you do is that not
refreshing
Meiko refresh now go refresh now now
it's way too fucking far out
fuckin Christ Jesus fook hi Jesus kick
loudly to draw us out that's our TVs
right there is one lady like I want to
say like a month or so ago one came up
on on Craigslist and you have to be the
the thing is you have to be careful
about like the the model number it has
been very it's this very specific one
and all my research there's this like oh
you can't get the F V to 70 because the
way they do scaling it's like what are
you know if you're gonna get a heavy ass
classic TV make sure you get the right
you want to get the right one and so I'm
talking to this lady and she's selling
it through email and she's selling it
for like 20 bucks or something it's like
oh I want that but you know that's like
it was a drive out and it would like it
were to require more than one person to
lift Taryn and she wasn't gonna help me
lift it that was part of the stipulation
that sounds like can you check the model
number and she emailed me back couldn't
find it you know I just want to get rid
of the thing and I know it's like I know
I'm being a total dickhead here just
like no that's fine congratulations are
you are you doing store motor you can
fuck around motor doesn't matter get out
of this okay don't see in first person
while we're driving
there you go that's a nice car I think
this looks great
I mean maybe that's because you know
I've been playing blood-borne and
there's a lot of fancy things going on
in that really I don't know Los Angeles
is this accurate I'm sure it's heavily
based on blood oh it's not okay but like
for the last month like Liberty City it
basically something that looks just like
the Met Building Oh God
now you're just hitting people oh sure
and I'm sure like they have like
neighborhoods that are perfectly
accurate yeah yeah that would be
interesting to me to see one that's
exactly yeah it's a you know we're the
real roads and landmarks and stuff
the guy who the guy who did all the
programming for Super Meat Boy
Tommy my fans I did a charity livestream
in which he chose games with large maps
like grand theft auto 5 and just walked
the entirety of the map in game didn't
drive didn't do any missions just walked
a circle oh okay
oh I didn't know if it was like the
mission to get there with a clean car no
I'm not playing won't you suing us great
that's all okay people are saying that
the draw distance the fog of war in in
older games like they just couldn't
render stuff too far away from the
character and so like if you if you look
if rich goes to like a long Street and
you look really far down it gets foggy
just because they don't want to render
those graphics but oh sure but now this
this actually looks big
nice that made the screen I mean beat
this guy
oh you're supposed to be I think he won
though cuz his car's not all I would
have expected expecting them to try and
make it look really really nice visually
I don't think you're supposed to go down
ruin my jump oh no you completed it
great yeah ya did good and sure did not
look very sweet at all oh my god what is
happening with the camera
that he was aiming for me he was trying
to get you yeah why would he do that oh
my god
nice steal that car it's less damaging
than yours
are you trying a trick down oh my god
yeah this is the real game right here
well now you're gonna get shot
people are saying overall they think the
frame rate draw distance lighting and
textures are all improved on this game
it might it might be nostalgic for as
hyped as this was it's not a football
you oh so it's coming it's coming to ps4
it's coming it's coming and they're just
kind of so you agree that there's an
improvement you just think there should
have been more yes okay okay I wonder if
there will they didn't do much to
improve like textures or whatnot I
wonder if they'll be a big jump PC was
seven discs by the way did you see that
no for one game for one game it comes
yeah cousin
is there a soundtrack the tangerine
Dream's soundtrack in there is that one
of the best I'm not gonna say anything
bad about tangerine dream but in general
soundtrack in this place that really
compares of the other grant if that was
good
I used to love listening to radio oh
yeah 60 gigabyte or it could be I could
be thinking of I could be thinking
before the many bowls and all the best
soundtrack in the series is well debated
Vice City or or San Andreas
Vice City was great great soundtrack
senator is classic classic eighties
music class of 90s music now this they
just found like cheaper contemporary
stuff
part of me oh my god pardon me I haven't
been watching Decker have you been
watching Decker Decker Decker
Tim Tim Heidecker oh no I am I I see him
tweet about it constantly and I just
have not had the energy to click on that
one
no I haven't seen any this card doesn't
mean it's taken a shitload of damage is
this a is this a it might be different
for those on a mission Khokar yeah maybe
maybe they stopped smoking I sneezed
yeah that wasn't a cough it's because
you're allergic to
I don't I don't know where you're going
Jay stop sneezing okay that'll try and
do on it Oh
wasted I mean that looks great hey uh
you landed I don't know what they're
talking about fail like where's
Hollywood Boulevard get the Hollywood
Boulevard because I know my way around
there oh you're playing a mission I
think you're just driving around they
can totally resell this car this cars
fine um we we had talked briefly about a
prereq one-year event as the our
one-year is coming up did we talk about
maybe I just talked about with Jesse
it's probably not gonna happen just
because we don't want to think about
that we would rather just make more
episodes yeah yeah that's why we've
never done anything special for any sort
of anniversaries or right I think we're
coming up on five years of half in the
bag Jesus Christ five or four years see
I don't even know I don't pay attention
um we started in 2011 so next year would
be five years look at this look at their
car
that's beautiful okay all right I'll
just buff that out just off that right
something with the physics cuz I know on
the ps3 version that car would have
driven like crap or that much damage
not even booth it's just a joke right
there oh my god look look it's it's a
good two feet shorter right was
that's really funny so yeah probably not
anything now just keep making stuff just
keep making stuff I don't get
sentimental about the kind of thing it
is it's always interesting to look back
because I don't care about stuff like
that I hadn't I had no idea there's a
rear-engine oh are you going to try a
100 episode celebration for a half in
the bag
oh there's maybe 100 episodes is kind of
a big deal mm-hmm that's more
interesting to me than like how many
years we've been doing something who
knows so that means no probably nothing
well we talked about doing with prereq
it was like for the first episode just
like like one of 283 remember why we
didn't yes I didn't do exactly 283
episodes and be done or are or you do
like then you do like 281 of 280 yeah
yes yeah
what are we even up to on half a little
bit I think the one that's being added
in right now is 85-86
because in another two years I just
think the other day like I was I was
doing something really cool and awesome
I was updating my t-shirt spreadsheet
t-shirt spreadsheet because I have a
t-shirt spreadsheet of all of the shirts
that I wear on every episode the best of
the worst and previously recorded time
okay that I don't double up on t-shirts
Wow
okay you know because I'm a super cool
guy and it's almost getting to the point
where we've done more prereqs than best
of the worst I've been on mmm yeah well
you're on every prereq you're not on
every vest of the word exactly I also
think having that spreadsheet is really
important you have to worry about that
with half of the bag right yeah you have
outfits I have an outfit you have a
costume which I just bought a new shirt
for it oh because I don't know if you've
ever noticed but if you go to a store to
buy a Dickies shirt yeah you can't find
anything larger than a medium and Dickie
shirts are large anyway they're larger
than like a normal you know medium rare
sir so if you watch half in the bag my
shirt goes down to my goddamn knees and
also Dickies are supposed to be tucked
in all right so I finally I went to the
diggie's website and I got a small so
the next half in the bag I have a shirt
that fits a tiny bit better and it's
still too big because dick oh my god
oh hey you landed Oh so in the next half
in the bag we are gonna see the new one
you're gonna see the brand new shirt
this is a big deal you heard it here a
prereq live exclusive look out I don't
think anyone will even be able to tell
the difference probably those Nikki
shirts they're they're big they're not
proper sizes I'm in the next day or two
okay good I could say tomorrow and I
wouldn't be joking
yeah tomorrow yeah next couple day or
two there I don't know exactly
sometimes these things take well you
never know that's the the beauty and
magic of editing oh I don't know got it
guy like where does the walk of fame I'm
not sure all right I don't know I've
seen it's kind of like where's this
there's is there like the Mann's Chinese
Theater
bike bike motorcycle yes okay oh my god
don't break it that's fine
I'll punch him in the head punch him in
the head oh you don't have to see so
good what rich Jimmy can he do that
tell me get off it won't you've made a
friend this is the most fucked-up thing
I've ever seen
why did he get on oh this is totally
Hollywood Boulevard oh great
yeah there's oh yeah there's the Stars
okay oh yeah there's the theater across
the street they're right where the
Grauman's well you can't see from this
angle hold on we're dealing with a
doppelganger here yeah look at her
earlier that's the theater oh great okay
so now we can find our way around okay
so head head that way
head straight oh oh hey what the fuck
did I do to you man that's Jordan well
you play my game yo
I play my game you like
turn around and go the other way yeah
okay so that's the Chinese Theatre yeah
there should be we're right this drunk
is that what the signs new movie is
bitch trunk but it's drunk okay that's
great
so now if you go to this the next stop
lights in front of you and take a right
you should get into a cool hilly area
assuming this is accurate right that's
all we're gonna see oh oh yeah there's
the hills up there yep okay yeah that's
gonna need that that's correct there you
go that's kind of correct yeah
somewhere up in here is Chris Kattan
house painstaking detail full grotto and
everything oh yeah so it's semi yes
that's really nice that's good yeah I
was I was trying to guide them to the
old bean factory oh man I wanted to
track down the old bean factory there's
just no way there's no way it could be
anywhere I wanted to find it how would
we find it you can't just google old
bean factory what if we could I did
actually no I mean like what if we could
find it oh oh there well that's when I
was out there last year that's what I
wanted to do because we shot that
episode but it wasn't edited yeah it was
like if I could do something while I'm
out there at the old bean factory that
would be amazing but it was not meant to
be okay I'm on it all right
yeah but those are like four million
dollar homes so those are like the
middle-class you know there's so much
I just joined how many more games has
rich stolen from kids since the start of
this dream only three so he's really
cutting back you stole a motorcycle you
stole two motors so where's it go now
and now you're trespassing but can you
move can you remove cap can you close
the fucking cow
I wonder if they have the Hollywood Bowl
in here the sciences Vinewood if you can
the other the other place I know how to
drive - he's gonna shoot you shoot him
back I don't never good
Oh oh my god this is real life
they're shooting at an unarmed black man
this game is so realistic race you
actually swim pretty fast that's pretty
good where'd the cops go can you get in
the house thank you worse that was the
best Grand Theft Auto - cuz you mostly
because you're about to leap two years
in the air and you died midair where you
would have died when you landed fucking
me up
got stripe on it I don't like that you
were yelling at me do a job gotta better
do it right sure sure
oh do you think we can find the
Scientology building yes yes I do miss
the Scientology building it's I saw it
like on Hollywood Boulevard there was
some sort of Scientology it wasn't like
the real building this is probably
significantly disguised for legal
reasons oh sure but there is a building
that's the the head of this game's
version upset oh Sid oh yeah like right
on the Walk of Fame they have like a
little it's almost like a kiosk in a
building that's what I saw better well
you did just run over someone there's a
bigger Center you know the inspiration
for friends of ours what I'm speaking of
you hitting one person yeah pac-man oh
yeah the people are dots oh oh that's
great I don't think I think you're
joking no I've heard this oh yeah one
creator suddenly pac-man was an
inspiration what's it the first Grand
Theft Auto game was like top down you
know very much like a pac-man grid oh
yeah
but then the so so there's that one on
Hollywood Boulevard there's the big
Center further south like closer to like
La Brea but then like the secret Center
is right if you go to UCB Upright
Citizens for great Brigade and
oh I know where that's that it's right
across the street they're all a giant
like forest covered building oh that's
like bear like detox center okay oh I
missed that cuz I was driving and I saw
upright citizens brigade and I was
looking at that it was like hey there it
is yep right across the street okay
hovered in shadow and woods is where
they're like hold people to do whatever
it wants it's not a religion whatever
according to several governments it's
not a religion
for sure you can see it from Michael's
house oh great
also you have a blood stain on your cars
a big goober of blood on the front of
your car I just kind of love that yeah
that's it that's at least in this game
is there saintil yep that looks just
like it J but this is the Scientology
bullet
okay which isn't really Scientology can
you break it I know I probably mad now I
know there's a game missions involving
these guys they might give you a goofy
suit you have to work for like a week in
game time I'm sure they keep wanting a
lot of money I'm sure if you wait wait
get out of your car and just walk close
to it I wonder I wonder if like they get
out and harass you like they do in real
life from if you walk close to their
building in real life they like it they
like harass you and ask you what you're
doing
there is that there's the music there
Dianetics music Oh creepy yeah that's
great no this is not the building that
they they chased me from they chased me
from like the the bigger the bigger more
public place and then there is a like
Scientology recruiter character who
hangs out by a mall I'm not sure if he's
there just from the start all the time
or if you have to get further of a story
before you start showing up nice but
there is a guy who says these totally
fucked up things did you know them no
I think that's great I think it's great
yeah I think they do like the in the
Scientology buildings like they post
people as guards they have like
centuries you know just just draining my
battery I'm the only person on the world
absolutely hates that function you know
sometimes it works sometimes it works
sometimes it doesn't it doesn't do much
for me it just sucks out battery life a
vampire yeah yeah
do people know where I can find the
Scientology guy if he's even
oh no John kilo saying that the thetan
levels are rising steadily at the arlen
studios so we might need a stress test
Rockford hills that's in Illinois names
have been changed to protect the
innocent right
oh I'm sorry
see this is why it's good not to be
reliant on any kind of GPS device
what do you mean normally when I find
things in this game I just go to the GPS
I told where I want to go sure I don't
know the map as well as I should just
say of knowing about that huh because
you've been too reliant on together I
think so yeah that's very true real life
yep that is true that's a you know what
in San Andreas I could find my way
around oh yeah oh yeah anywhere in that
game yes I knew Santa dress like the
back of my hand before GPS was the thing
yeah
that's great then emulating art
imitating life apparently you can go to
the pier and talk to Jesus Christ I know
that the Scientology guys what I'm just
right now see available Scientology guys
wear the diamond heist is okay I'm
trying to turn off the stupid vibrator
every every every time I feel bad I
think oh there's five less minutes five
minutes I don't know if I have any more
acid stories I'm sorry guys I did it a
couple of times I told you about the
second time I did it when my
ex-girlfriend showed up and I didn't
know she was coming and I tried to play
it cool and I was not cool and we were
trying to I mean of my roommates were
trying to hide the fact that we were
doing acid but we were watching The Lion
King and had jugs of orange juice all
around the house because apparently the
vitamin C and orange juice intensifies
the acid huh okay
and so like they came over and we were
just like hey guys just drinking orange
juice
I don't know if I've ever told my
getting high on marijuana while also
snorting ritalin that sounds like a bad
idea
it was awesome because usually when you
get high on the pod you get a little wax
a days ago you get a little loosey
goosey if you will but mixing that with
riddlin make made you equally as kind of
like euphoric and mystified by noises
and things and colors but very focused
you just wanted to sit down and read
every book ever written okay it was
great it was fantastic see here is this
where the Dymatize is this looks like
the diamond district yes Oh
oh now we get to talking who the guy in
blue oh yeah do what you got to do is
you guys might be here a double all
right they're fried they're fine with
that
well I don't do drugs around my kids I
don't do drugs anymore in general when I
was younger
I'm an old man how things you do in your
yep these are the things you do when
you're younger and dumb well some people
do right I never did yeah that's fine
you know what that's fine why is it not
getting me in TV you're in fair TV oh
the TV
I think the TVs described because I can
hear a very faint bloop bloop but
there's not an option do it justify you
know now we have to adjust the volume on
the TV okay okay which I don't know oh
did you bring the remote in here no oh
my god we can do this we figured this
out before we know how to figure out
what before you can do it
Oh which is also a hidden button like
the eject button on the oh yeah I don't
even know what had that option you you
instead of just pushing it you move it
left to right or up or down oh yeah
interesting yeah I've never messed with
it I did it I got it why are we
listening to this so you can hear that
this is the Scientology guy yeah okay
oh no that yeah guys this is the screen
you see when rich goes into like the
options menu so you don't see like his
personal information or what
I don't know how to do that great really
great how are you well I know how you
are so it's true what they say about you
weirdos need hey last night I was in 45
different places at the same time I know
my truth brother brother brother brother
but reasonable and talk
I would only some people can hear them
that's sperm he's a lot if he does not
exist you were told about sperm to make
you believe in the great evolutionary
myth if evolution were true we'd be able
to fly just like planes and that's
that's really great yeah and that is a
factor brother so they don't like
redheads
laughter won't make you happy
pick a new set of lies can you kill them
ha ha ha ha
oh can you punch you in the face was it
I'm gonna hear a few more things okay
okay price and it's a price worth paying
salvation is available to anyone who
wants it
and to anyone who can afford my hair was
always brown my beard is red I'm not a
beer yes it's very strong at the same
time you walked into heaven okay
come more that's funny and dick punch
I'm not growing my beard out I was
thinking about it I walked for uh for a
little bit I was thinking about it I
came close to yeah even like you know
shaved my head let my beard grow shave
my head let my beard grow it's like
alright I'm committing this time I can
do it two reasons one you know like
there is life that awkward beard phase
where it's like not quite grown in and
just oh sure
kind of look a little silly and I
thought I could get over that hump then
also I'm a crazy person and so I thought
about the branding problems that it
would oh my right and well you know I
it's a dumb thing to think about but
this is how people know me man it's like
yeah right again it was enough to push
me over I was teetering on the edge like
I had people know me as the guy who's
all bald all
Lisa doesn't like it she appeared that
that to me would be more of a factor
right Brandi uh it's important is it I
mean I guess it might be but I don't
care about it like I said I was on the
edge right in front of me god dammit
Thank You fractal factor Jack took LSD
once and now he thinks about Brandi or
he'll think about branding yeah no
that's all the best thing about having a
beard is that you don't have to shave oh
I know I've always hated shaving yes I I
have sensitive skin right and when I
shave like it always like for the first
day or so like my face is a disaster yep
so that's that's a big reason why I
ended up growing the beard hmm I hate
shaving
I agree by the way I also hate shaving
now you know I do think that being fully
shaven looks better even when I started
growing out the beard it didn't quite
feel right okay you know this is just my
look now people this is how we got to
deal with it okay how are you coming
along okay no I mean oh yeah we still
got a shoot for space cop all right
shaving does hurt oh my god you're an
attractor why not
Jay was meant to have a beard a found
his apparently I didn't realize that for
the longest time this is why it's hard
to follow the story of grand theft
artists
no I'm not attract
oh this is like Santa Monica right
that's supposed to be yeah wake it up
the stairs yeah you need a little more
momentum you can do it no I don't think
the bald the beard would suit me I think
so again let's bring it back to branding
that's not I'm more I'm more of the
jovial one of the group I make jokes a
lot I don't think the beard bald thing
works with someone who is going for a
comedic tone
that's great he does like the hippie
version of Bible yeah I think it's great
but he never comes out no no no that's
really funny what you gotta beat the
shit out of him now I do yeah you beat
the shit out of the other guy and this
is Jesus just beat him oh yeah we beat
up everyone

the rlm page because because I posted he
goes J posted him
we were hoping we got a little busy with
some stuff but we were I was really
hoping that this blood-borne review
would be done already and so that like
the hand of favor view would go up to
just the YouTube channel and we would
kind of skip it and have the blood-borne
review ready in time but then we got
super busy so in order in order to keep
content fresh on the site J posted it
had I known we would have been so late
with the blood-borne review I would have
waited to post the hand of fate review

pretty much my solution October 21st
21st yes that's the day okay that's
great that's great
I'm sure Jay love to the new Mad Max
trailer I haven't seen it actually oh
okay
for I don't know why I think I'm there's
been like this is like what the fourth
trailer so I'm kind of like maxed out on
the trailers I just want to see the
movie pattern on it I realized that as I
was saying it but I had no I don't want
to see any more trailers doesn't we go
see the movie because I'm excited for it
I feel like there's been too many
trailers and they're gonna dilute it a
bit yeah so I have not seen the new
trailer yet slab bulkhead yes this is
live we are we're streaming live right
now rich is fucking around and Grand
Theft Auto 5 and stream and dead sure
we're doing it oh there it is nice this
place is full of garbage that's a chippy
no Oh lots of movies a shot here repo
man Oh oh shit how did you lose your
foot cuz it's in water oh oh it drowns
yeah I'm sorry
and have fun that is one of the that's
always the first thing I would do when
starting like a new game of san Andreas
is our drive up to the mountains because
the bike riders in the mountains I'd
like the choppers and I like the chap
who's the best so I would steal a car
drive up to the mountains get a chopper
and then drive that around San Andreas
your ass it would probably fit can we
cut that out can we edit that cut that
right out that's right this game is not
this game is not accurate because
there's water in the aqueducts right now
so it's not very accurate
yeah there's a little that's too much
right now
they Trouten
they're gonna be a wicked ass jump over
here oh yeah drive drive
shot here too oh well I saw some of the
chat was doing the lyrics of the song
that's playing during that part time
just deep enough basically yes
oh okay
nope oh hey it's like the supermarket it
opens for you it's like imagine we're
gonna stream until this vibrating kills
my battery I hate the vibrate function I
hate it I'm I can feel my battery dying
and you can't shut it off can turn it
off
no is there way in
you know what you tried in menu is their
way in game to turn off library function
I want it off for everything well don't
you know I'm giving you it I don't want
it a little bit off some of the time I
went it off all the time
that's what he said to her said the
Sailor to the young lady that's so my
favorite joke now more like dead bolt
boom there's gotta be a way to turn the
software in game I want it off for
everyday oh well you have to go ever
forever and ever you have to go into
every game and do that that's that's
horrible
that's life right no that's options
that's kind of things you be in the
system in you want the stupid thing to
have work or not that's that's that's
totally that totally should be running
over hookers just cuz you're mad at Sony
for their vibrate function doesn't mean
you could just run over any hooker you
want
much easier to spin out at the stickman
Grit thank you for subscribing we very
much appreciate it it's right on to the
sticks yeah that since it's great
look how shiny that car is it
whoa Oh God oh my god steal that truck
now yeah but I bet you could ask they're
saying that it should be in the device
settings of the PS button okay
whoo burrito yes he just bought wool a
few days ago and really liked it so far
yes keep reading oh that's that book
that's that book this is so fucking good
it's that book future dystopian people
all of humanity lived in a giant silo
buried underground okay it's a beautiful
book it really is it really is a
beautiful book about human misery and
suffering
your car legs I have been recognized
twice I think I got recognized at a
Starbucks in Minnesota and that was
super fun it was actually really weird
it was the first time I was recognized
and I was like why do you know my he I
made my drink order and he goes jack
right why do you know my name
like I check to see if I was like
wearing a name tag or something this is
not right that looked really difficult
well no usually I just Ram them with a
car oh and they fall off all right it's
funnier though if you have to physically
pull them off and throw them under the
concrete yeah I was also recognized at a
beer garden hmm a young lady came up to
me and asked to take a picture with me
and I was like really okay
three maybe four times yeah yeah a year
yeah yeah great
we're just one with some like 11 year
old kid no grocery store
he saw me getting out of his face cop
car and his father was just like are you
talking to the strange fat middle-aged
man and the kid is like that's Richie
fucking Evans rich mother and horrible
pain oh sorry
chromic s'en yes we really like
blood-borne and no the beer bottle

very much like blood our review will be
done
soonish powerball blood I played super
brothers sword & Sworcery and really
enjoyed it I had it on the phone and
it's a super fun interesting game the
problem with it it was on my phone and
so I wanted to only play it for short
fuse time it's like oh you know I got
five minutes I'll just pop open the
phone game but it's so beautiful that it
made me want to play it longer and
playing something on your iPhone you
know gets you all crunched up at night
it's it's not as iPhones aren't
necessarily meant for long plays but I
wanted to play that longer and that was
my biggest problem because I liked
the only thing I play on my iphone is
solitaire you have solitaire I do that's
weird why is that weird
I like solitaire it's weird it's weird
you like yes it's weird I like it
sometimes not a game that you like it
was the only game on computers for a
long time no I like playing solid
oh the game is on PC that's great which
one super brothers is sword-and-sorcery
oh that's a little point-and-click
adventure a little like very light
combat element but mostly
point-and-click adventures it's really
really atmospheric and a nice art style
pixel art style but like the the art in
it is really beautiful and the story is
weird esoteric the music is phenomenal
you have to play it with headphones did
they tell you in the beginning if you're
not playing with headphones you're doing
it wrong then you then get better
headphones play the game are you just
gonna run into a train this is just
drive it I kind of love it
this is what you're doing Grand Theft
Auto everyone thinks it's about beating
up hookers no it's about enjoying the
world it's about beating yourself it's
about look at all this stuff
somebody somebody built that light and
that those girders
yeah there's a programmer we just made
all this shit
someone coded put it or somebody coded
that code though just to reflect that
light just so maybe just cuz maybe when
I'm driving on the train tracks if I
decide to drive on the train tracks I'll
Drive 200 miles an hour a little bit
look now you're being illuminated by the
light that they programmed move up move
up to the light so that light can shine
on you rich let that light shine on you
that's great someone coded I have never
played harvest stone
I have no interested I don't know and
then it struck no I was really hoping
you hit that like a lectric my
motorcycle versus train who wins
electrical box probably safer trains for
well which can you steal a train a plane
yep well then why aren't you why aren't
you flying because I'm gonna fucking
motorcycle driving on a train track in a
tunnel
oh shit woods that's why not oh my god
now you're on a bridge oh there's a
train coming how can you tell oh oh is
that's just lights in the tunnel
no the lights in the tunnel looked like
they were like coming closer to
No
we I can't believe you're doing this
you're mountain climbing on a motorcycle
alright I was a deer you almost hit that
fucking deer it was a deer yeah I looked
away for a second they missed it
punk shows deer see if you can get some
venison there's a whole hunting thing in
this game oh yeah good night sweet bike
are you trapped in the middle of nowhere
you got to find a car you can find
another bike by the way River to Evans
zero officially lost two bikes can you
ride a deer no that would be awesome red
dead redemption right a horse strange
thing in the sky a cloud it's a
spaceship there is a Eastern regular
phone this game oh really
that was just clowns though but there is
an easter egg you'll fall if you go to
this one
like obscure he'll go back deep deep in
the woods
the button to run you can get eaten yes
that's pretty great
that is pretty grand this is why I
haven't gotten very far the story mode
in this game yeah this is impressive as
far as how like expansive oh yeah
environments are yeah that's really cool
this is their thing yes what they do
it's what they do great that's great
I don't know if you don't know if we can
beat that I don't know if we can be
getting mauled to death by a mountain
lion no not out there yeah you know and
on the high note right we're talking
about ending it right I mean I weren't
trying hijack a plane oh oh shit well
that's how you do it that's how we do it
yeah I'll get a chicken right a chicken
right a chicken a chicken punch a
chicken can you punch a chicken punch
the chicken I'm just my car I just want
a car so I'm driving back to LA so I
could drive to the airport and steal the
plane oh that's all I want
there's no cars somebody in this stick
town drives a backyard
give me that thing you know somehow I
don't think it would play out like that
in the sticks I can only imagine that
that man wearing the camo vest was armed
oh I got a four-wheel hat you have to
get that four-wheeler go get it
alright I'm on the way ride the
four-wheeler on the freeway excuse me
sir why bother you know that you know
what that kind of looks doofy oh it's
great over Oh someone is saying there
should be a closer airstrip really Oh
nice head ok
that's a good idea after day when the PC
version comes out if it's notably better
we'll get rich the PC version and I'll
take this version sure yeah sure and
we'll track down Jordan and we'll track
down this game back say sandy shores
airfield you're right by it but is there
a big bigger plane there I'm gonna still
playing I'm going big well I mean yeah
you have to
oh so you're out of 405 that's great
they said that one closer to you it's
much closer but only small planes yeah
okay exactly
we're still in a big goddamn plane oh
you fucker
four wheels why the small one to the
other airport that makes that makes fair
amount of sense I don't never get the
steel tube I don't remember the other
airports
yeah and doc the doctor uh that's not
active right boy dungeon master blaster
I have seen ia I own murder miners III
do have murder miners and I'm looking
forward to playing it looks like a
really fun little first-person shooter
I'm excited to play it I have not gotten
around to it
mostly because I've been playing only
blood-borne
oh you know something we didn't
necessarily talk about during the review
which I can talk about now I did try oh
there you go
I did try using my Vita as a to link up
with my ps4 to play blood-borne on my
Vita and it kind of worked the buttons
were super janky and there was tiny bits
of lag here and there but there were
stretches where I was playing oh oh you
have to stunt right it or what this is
here okay
yeah the lack of r2 and l2 buttons were
really tough though those turned into
like screen press buttons and the r3 and
l3 were the back touch panel which is
lock-on which is incredibly important in
blood-borne and so everything was all
janky and it was not much fun but it was
interesting not even close
okay well fly back to LA
fuck this fuck this yes
the my goal in life if there's a way to
play blood-borne or whilst pooping if
there is a way that I can be playing
blood-borne have to poop take it with me
to poop and bring it back and play it on
the ps4 your your your smaller Airport
ideas suck yep did the idea suck or did
you just suck it find the point no
because it wants me to do the mission
with the plane that's alright oh they're
saying that if you go directly west of
you on the hillside there is a military
base with fighter jets really ok this is
what obviously that sounds like I'll be
killed trying to steal no that's that's
a big possibility
Thank You REO Speedwagon giving a simple
life hack is you don't need to sit on
the toilet to poop that's true it's true
what's the problem that's one way to do
it that's one way to do it is there
another plane their plane is your 4x4
still there
well shit is their plane in there oh
well there's the dusty oh there's some
trucks oh no no no man thanks
hop off dick kick
oh no come on really I mean yes I would
absolutely
two country boys looking for a fighting
they lost yep peace no you shut the door
and broke the window right that's great
that's great
okay
the same Westerfield there is that's
what they're saying let's see here on
the far side of the nearby Lake to the
northeast there's another Airport
somebody just drive to Los Angelos gonna
bribe Los Angeles go to where you know
the plane is you ask your door that's
fine
the fewer cars in this version of the
game worse just me I
Genet I think there might be fewer hush
I mean you're in the sticks now there
are top stars in LA they've accounted
for population when you were in the city
man there you couldn't get away from
cars that's true so how about you settle
down
you
ah the windmills the majestic windmills
I'm rich there enough cars because you
stole them all that's true thank you
it's very true oh my god 25
can you ride the windmills there's
anything you can do when you steal play
and go to the windmills try to find
people okay yep
are you gonna do something else cool no
I was gonna recreate 911 Hey wrong City
Oh fine four point landing
you're right that's the other thing
that's unrealistic about this version of
LA is you can move in the traffic but
it's very true it's terrible
you know just to make the game fun they
have to do that yeah yeah if you have to
sit there congested you can't get
anywhere move for 45 minutes yeah that
wouldn't be a lot of fun how much do you
want to bet though that there was a
conversation oh sure yeah like dude what
do we do about the traffic how realistic
do you want to make the traffic sure the
question is how little can we get away
with I think that was the discussion it
wasn't I don't think there's ever a
questionable do we have oh I think there
was I think there may have I think they
were too smart today I doubt that even
came up I'm guessing there was at least
one meeting with like the top build
discussion point of like do we have
traffic yeah
I mean you might be right making these
games for years yeah they know how to
have fun
oh listen I'm not saying it was talked
about long but I'm saying like some
somebody maybe like the new guy in his
first day and then everybody glared at
him yeah like the the young intern who
just got like a paid position there's
like I've got my idea boss what if we
have traffic duh
they think like LA has a lot of traffic
we can make it relist
I'll go back to filling the coffee pots
no I gave it Shawn that man has never
worked in video games again
oh that's fun
go to the airport to go to where you
know there's a plane okay I'm sorry I
did I don't know
I know itself yourself rich rich is
flying right now
by the docks
yes and rich did manage to steal
possibly the shittiest car and I kind of
you got a car that's all that matters so
he's driving to the airport instead of
walking to it
mistakes mistakes it happened oh yeah
kimbos swag 1 2 3 if you oh yeah if you
don't know who we are in general I'm
sorry yeah well that's what he was just
like who's playing the game no like who
are these people
oh oh um rips we're weirdos we're dumb
guys who are playing video games we're
from red letter media we do we do movie
reviews on the Internet do movie reviews
and started some video game reviews our
show is called previously recorded you
can look us up on the youtubes and see
what we have to say about video games
and if you're nerdy enough you've heard
of these 70-minute
Phantom Menace review though that kind
of gave us mild internet famine it's
true it's true we have a show called
best of the worst in which we watch old
movies and make fun of the helmand J who
was here earlier and is not here right
now is probably coming back in a little
bit does a show called half in the bag
where he talks about current movies it's
crazy town that's who we are I'm gonna
say I could see people just browsing
twitch or whoever PlayStation uses to
find streams sure just running across
this randomly
I can see that I could see that and and
you might be confused we are not
professionals well we're just to reduce
some assholes I can't even
do you still have the show here you
watch bad movies yes yes we do
yes I've also done a bunch of other
internet videos but you know I'm here
now because of the red letter media
video so we're talking about that
oh I see it traffic oh that's so funny
left turn only saying that he found
Arlen because of best of the worst and
didn't hear didn't find blanket and so
much later yeah that's really funny
what oh so I think someone came to the
stream and was just like wait who are
you guys what like why are you here like
so we were trying to explain to what we
were and it was weird how did they just
stumble on the stream you could do that
oh guys that switch thing like if you go
to twitch the first thing it shows you
is just like the popular video games
being played now right ok so then they
say oh I would like to watch someone
playing Grand Theft Auto 5 oh here seems
like a happy group click on and start
watching wait a min what are they
talking about yeah alright I can get up
a soul okay you're at the airport you
are not at the airport anyway there's
the airport
there are sharks in the water yep oh my
god that's really I think I need to be
further oh we didn't update this dream
they wanted to watch blood-borne now I
think didn't doesn't that automatically
update on the ps4 when I titled the
stream blood-borne theft auto 5 yeah
okay covered all the bases
well what what game we're playing yeah
oh no actually it does say we're playing
grand theft auto 5 so I don't know what
you're talking about this dream is
updated lots of GTA streamers great I
could see that with as much as there is
to do in the game I could see that oh
you got a jump a color in there oh nice
ok
no this is the ps4 ruin that we're
playing
the core brazen rich and I really liked
blood-borne
we stopped playing it only because we've
been streaming it so much because we
liked it so much we really enjoyed it
the our full review discussion will be
will be out shortly
not shortly maybe next week

[Part IV]
now that we're back okay now we're back
now we're back for you oh my I forgot to
turn back on the microphones it
automatically shut off unregistered on
consoles are generally more useless so
for a while there for a while there we
were we were talking but no one could
hear us mm-hmm hold on I'm checking well
I guess I guess that means they'll never
know when the next point of review is
coming out oh it's coming out tomorrow
so rich why don't you retell everyone
your grand theft auto 5 store yeah this
is this is my this is my stolen copy of
grand theft auto 5 yes it's true looking
at me like I'm a monster I don't I don't
know what you're talking about
no I mean I know that stealing is bad
but I don't know what you're talking
about specifically we did the the blood
Harborview well is now yet but we're
doing the blood more in review and we
needed to get a second PlayStation 4
because that's a PlayStation 4 exclusive
oh I did hear this story yeah that's
right and so we bought the the second
ps4 and I was gonna get that one because
she already had your login information
on the other Russell and I take it home
I'm ready to play blood-borne right I
gotta put the disc in the disc isn't
going in rise in the disk going in
oh it must be a defective piece for
plastic strip worm I did the disk drive
should be right what the fuck what the
fuck I hit the the PlayStation button on
the controller where I try to eject the
disk there's there's no disk in there
there's no option to eject anything
right according to the main menu of the
PlayStation 4 card on the menu the place
before no games my god I just put her on
my fucking I'm lying information now we
gotta fucking take it back at the store
and get another one
yes I go I call up Jack and I'm like
Jack do you still have the receipt this
way stations but defective described but
did you try it Jacob there's no option
in the money you can't do it I don't
know how technology works out or not
they inject tells me that like one of
the seams on the PlayStation 4 is
actually an eject I'm not gonna touch
but they're hidden buttons right here
just just put a fucking eject button
with a big label that's this eject disk
on the front of the goddamn thing you
don't need to hide it in a crevasse
they're going for sleep sleep but but I
hit eject and you know it could have
been fucking anything in there it'd have
been like it could have been SSX tricky
tricky yeah no it's a fucking Grand
Theft Auto five spits out of the jackpot
and there was no there was no debate in
Rich's mind over whether or not we
should return it no smiled guilt I
wouldn't have guilt that's the fault of
whoever because it was by use misuse
that was the thoughts of whoever brought
it in its get it it's got a name written
on it Jay oh really does Jordan and the
letters look like they were written by a
child oh okay that makes meals yeah this
changes everything
and it's like no matter what way you
slice it this is bad you know you bring
you bring the game back it's not my game
stops gonna go out of the way and track
down little six-year-old Jordan right
well you know what six-year-old Jordan
should not be playing this game you know
what I saw Robocop when I came
are you rich up no you are I'm not fine
something was watching r-rated yes I I
have not become a violent psychopath
right rip my my boys have been watching
me play blood-borne oh yeah they love it
yeah they fucking level here's the thing
kids love violence it's true it's very
true they'll uh they love and you know
of course it's very important to deal
with things like what is reality and
what oh yeah obviously understand the
difference and if they don't then
they're crazy to begin with yes um but I
mean yeah I was watching fuckin Friday
the 13th movie is when I was tiny and no
they first Robocop they like the mus is
when we got to the snake part and like
the snakes first out of the guy's head
my six year olds like Wow Oh real baby
pictures my wife super pissed at me
here's great she's pissed that you're
bringing joy to your child absolutely
because that's what you're doing because
kids love that shit they do this the
kitchen scene and gremlins that was like
my favorite scene in any movie ever when
I get and there's nothing I can do about
it there's nothing I can do for poor
little six-year-old Jordan there's
nothing there's nothing you can do you
see the city roads are like an
illiterate 20 year old Jordan if you're
if you're listening to this comes the
brakes but I feel bad for you this is a
relatively new game obviously it's
somebody that fell on hard times or or
had their stuff stolen yeah that's
possible oh yeah this could be a stolen
tragic this could be a hot PlayStation
but by the way if it's a hot PlayStation
what that means is that game stop didn't
put a disc in to check that it worked oh
yeah so what the fuck everybody did
everything wrong but it ain't up to us
having this PlayStation or this was a
game that game stopped took in from
Jordan maybe you know maybe Jordan like
maybe it wasn't the ps4 maybe it was
just the game yeah they used this game
to test the ps4 and then like reset the
console with the disk in causing the
malfunction which i think is far more
likely they were testing the game and
then they did their kabuki magic to
really set the console that's what you
have to do with ps4 and
and they forgot the game in there so
it's it's taking a game from a big
faceless corporation mmm I can't play
the game it's installing apparently I
didn't know about this lengthy install
and I apologize ooh maybe it's a disk
what does it have to install the extra
shit and I don't know I don't know this
stuff works well if you didn't install
the game to load it would probably take
forever like like on blood-borne which
really needs to have an install option
you know I hope they had a patch for me
it's fine
it's a minute every time you die and you
die a lot I spent at this point probably
two hours looking at
loading screen you don't know but when
it's obnoxious your game the loading
screen is horribly obnoxious but when
you don't die how long did you make it
without without any without any seem
without any loading time you made it you
can make it theoretically hours and
sewing through the entire world under
streaming back and plus I'm just saying
the prick and you die a lot by design
the potential die a lot you look at it I
know you love the game and you don't
want to say anything negative because
you love the game that's true but no no
you be it the step up Jack you're a
fucking reviewer yeah this is the shit
you have to do for joy living the joy is
worth the joy and then the counter
points which are legitimate and exist
yeah this is uh this is a little
ridiculous what's happening here that's
I thought it's the iPod bloodborne did
this and you wouldn't have that loading
screen as much I thought you were having
this on just to chat with us and be like
oh yeah there's just some in the
background is ever just concern about
how awesome already movies are when
you're six right right which is true
yeah I don't know I don't know when I'm
trying to think of like the first oh I
know what it was there's the first
r-rated movie now the first are like the
first movie that I saw too young and I
realized that was too young to be
watching it I don't think I ever had
that experience yeah I did Washington oh
wow that'll do very similar 30 years
you're doing something some woman's ass
with the toothbrush and you just scarred
everybody losing mine is it true is that
actually what was going on
toothbrush of all I wasn't going into
anything it was just brushing her ass
wait what I thought is the real thing
that happens in pornography
I'm not googling this no it's
not to Robocop didn't mess you up
it's the toothbrush porn toothbrush in
someone's asshole there you go that's
great that's good for me it was
sleepaway camp - Oh sleepaway camp -
where's the good one when it's that one
which is a softcore porn there's a lot
of sex and they move there's a one
character - it says one actress I feel I
almost feel bad for her
she's like naked and fucking that whole
movie the entire movie yeah yeah I was
watching it it was like a friend of a
friend's dad or something and and he's
like yeah watch watch this movie that
was his movie and he left like midway
through and it's just like I am too
young to see this yeah I knew it I knew
it I did not stop watching
oh of course not the best part is that
character she's having sex with some
dude in the woods hmm and they're going
at it and then when they're done she
gets up she's putting her clothes back
on she's like hey you don't have AIDS or
anything do you
and he's like no it's like okay great
thanks see you later and it just leaves
oh I like sleep boy can't do that's
coming out on blu-ray from screen
factories shut the fuck up it's true I
don't know if I can ever want to edit
movie again it's it's it's a comedy more
than anything it is I was far too young
to see it yeah I had those like I like
the toxic avenger I saw when I was too
young it's like I didn't get that it was
supposed to be a comedy cuz there was
like horrific violence this is like so
it like my brain didn't understand then
this could possibly be funny so yeah
that's the movie that fuck man
fucked with my brain when I was little
no I oh I I understood Robocop though I
mean I didn't understand the satire of
it but I didn't like it wasn't an
outright comedy like something like the
toxic avenger was so I kind of like got
it but the toxic avenger made no sense
to me like I felt like weird and dirty
after it cuz I did not
what it was doing my mother loved the
movies yeah a family night family night
was Friday the 13th it's like I like
horror movies but you know when you're
with people when you're with people who
don't like them it's just no fun yes
true you know you need to be with people
who like to see the splatter yeah yeah
there's nothing worse than watching a
movie that you love with somebody who's
not enjoying it at all that's like the
most awkward uncomfortable feeling and
you realize that not even just that but
or just like a movie that you are just
kind of enjoying yeah like it just kills
the buzz it's be gonna kill the buzz
it's almost there what's going out of
here
have you not played this sir Ivan's my
book work oh sure I think I've guides a
play Grand Theft Auto 5 but it's on the
ps3 oh ok ok I'm with you this is the
fights of schmancy version oh speaking
of scream factory a little irritated no
no they have a thing if you preorder
their blu-rays directly from their
website you get them two weeks earlier
