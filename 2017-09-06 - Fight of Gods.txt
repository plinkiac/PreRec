[Part I]
Oh even though like I did a really bad
thing
I didn't retitle the stream so a lot of
people are gonna get an email now and
it's not going to say the right thing
that we're playing what Mario Rabbids
yeah well I think they're gonna want to
see this rich one once they know what it
is and - it's even better because now
they don't know what it is yeah rich has
no idea what we're playing also rich is
quiet what what rich is quieter than I
am
hold on figure this yeah yeah lots of
static on audio
or are we getting or were we getting
audio from the camera what what out of
the gate right out of the gate when I
tap it it goes away is that a compressor
thing there we go hey who wants some uh
some technical difficulties right off
the bat here we go now you should be
able to hear both of us well how about
some converse um confirmation that you
can hear both of us
yeah okay great okay so here's what we
got
chat I have not told rich the name of
the game we are playing he doesn't know
the game we're playing you don't know
what game we're playing I wanted to keep
it a secret from everyone right now I'm
just doing a display capture so you can
watch the trailer for the game that
we're gonna play live with rich Evans I
write I hope I'm frightened I hope I
hope you did get are you ready to watch
the trailer all right for the game here
we go okay
Oh since that game where the gods fight
each other the one that I had to get
censored they didn't like Shiva being
portrayed the way Shiva traditionally
was portrayed I don't think that's this
arises Oh God Oh God yeah yeah it was on
a sale on Steam yesterday and it for a
ridiculously cheap price Jesus has the
cross still attached to his hands and he
uses it to fight and it looks like it's
gonna be a good time so we are going to
play fight of gods we are going to play
fight of gods which I am frankly pretty
excited about all right turn that off
for now all right so we'll get this game
started this is so bad yeah and
obviously like I don't know if this is
gonna take up the entire stream but I
thought it was funny enough where we
might be able to get some comedy out of
this
now hold on for a second because I
forgot to update chaddy
my bad news display capture for that
yeah did you switch it to game I I'm
about to do that right now fight of
let's see here fight of dogs fight of
grodd's what just happened everything's
what's the name of the stream rich fight
of or how about dent how about no how
about this I said battle up up down down
left right God what do you come up with
the worst thing huh the worst thing
the well you know what this is called
rich spitballin I'm spitballing ideas up
up down down left right God like blessed
battles better okay I didn't hear that
sorry I was I'm spitballing religious
Rumble Oh see getting uh getting the old
and the old brain holy war that's great
what is this called again fight
update my main man geez right
okay we are updated there you go have a
laptop we are going to play fight of
gods are we doing this to player to
start with or well yeah or you know one
of us will check it out neither of us
gonna have the laptop if someone has to
be both have to have a controller
Madeline you know boy Bible thump oh
that's good bible thump Bible thump yeah
this work was inspired by cultures and
stories from around the world
in mortal combat
I prefer Bible thump in moral combat
immoral combat it's like two jokes
layered on top of each other weirdly or
dori then you just called moral combat
yeah immortal works
no immoral plays what I'm saying moral
combat
yeah but they're immortal so instead of
mortal combat it's immortal combat oh
sure
I like moral combat better why why
because that's their supposed to have
his morals
I was skipping this course giving this
so we can get to fullscreen action now
we played Mario yesterday Jack did not
update the title before we started which
is a mistake I have made many different
times
push the graphics to the best certainly
boom watch the stream crash ya chansons
a type divine judgment oh well you know
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna test it
out it's got a normal difficulty hell
dude I just wanna like you kind of gotta
play as Jesus right away don't let you
look at that look at that the Blues is
there Wilson okay so guys ooze okay you
got Buddha kind of our place Buddha you
have Guan gong I don't know who that is
you have Odin random Athena classic
classic Moses oh never mind I'm playing
as Moses with the Ten Commandments on
his back
is that a nubes yeah it's hard to choose
their Anubis looking good I'm a - I'm no
idea I'm a Taurus ooh
and I'm being Moses first I'll be oh
I'll be real with you oh he's got
different skin or you can unlock
different skins yes I'm assuming that's
Yahweh in the middle no that's random
Halas random random surely Yahweh is
unlockable I think that's Whitney
never really right it's it's there's no
one who you ask
image rights Holy Trinity a little bit
Moses apparently he's a God now Jesus is
God well not not if you're Jewish or a
Muslim not if it is not the embodiment
of God but if you're a lot of religions
yeah but just a prophet some people
think he was just a guy just a dude some
people aren't even sure he was right no
Satan right oh yeah you need a Satan
there's no real evidence outside of the
bottle outside of the Bible for Jesus
existence
probably should have looked up looking
for like like some kind of like Roman
census data or something right not non
non Bible letters or anything
referencing him
where is Inu maybe in an update
I've been down for Xenu this is this is
early access that something should know
oh how do you do special shit I really
should have looked that book at the
causeway Oh smack to you with the
commandments I'm hoping that jacking
button math my way through but I
absolutely cannot special special
special
here we go oh the holy light the holy
lady fills me
all right I got my I got my head strikes
now I got my mad my mad Moses scrat's
shit there's gotta be something like
plague frogs really oh shit
I'm just button mashing at this point
that seems to be like however I'm doing
that move the grab the grab and hit her
up with my thing that seems to be
working pretty well not every fighting
game ever
I don't know now this is every fighting
game ever just the one sheet small
attack
Moses brings the pain
Moses is like 120 years old he's gonna
die so he's young
didn't biblically Moses living to
something like 500 oh sure you know it's
something absurd like that it was
insanely long lived it's been a while
it's been a while since I read the good
book my friend I'm countering a lot you
know I think that's doing this
Moses was 900 so this is young Moses yep
history history of the world reference
but God has given you the 15 crack ten I
love you he's a master after I'm done
with this round I'm gonna look up how to
play this game I'm pretty excited about
that
I just wanted to jump right in Adam Noah
and other early guys all live like 900
years
well not in reality in reality these are
all people that probably didn't exist
certainly certainly so in Adams case
there may have been a farmer somewhere
who built the boat during the flood a
local flood there could be some like
inspiration for the Noah story that just
got ridiculously exaggerated as that was
in the course of centuries I was gonna
say all you know who what you know who
else lived for a ridiculously long
amount of time is Bilbo Baggins yeah
yeah you know even he aged he was he was
the oldest of the hobbitses there may
have been a farmer who like save some of
his sheep by putting them in like a boat
that may have happened sure
like wing of the river fluttered a bit
gotta ruin his farm but he saved his
goats
Jesus rich do you stand up in the middle
of a crowded theater and yelled Darth
Vader isn't real we're playing this game
and this wasn't my choice and this is
what we're talking about I'm sorry
staff miracle 10 commandments down down
forward forward down forward down back
mighty uppercuts like the only time this
ever came up with family was when I got
forced into the confirmation right so
you know fuck you I'm sorry you're so
sensitive about your beliefs
when I started more of the chosen I just
finished Mario Plus rabbits which before
I move on I might play that a bit more I
might finish up all the things
challenges
I should change this it's easy
I'm glad that they gave what they gave
city jiggle physics come back to button
mashing
first mistake was not picking food well
listen look at Moses Lord Odin vs Zeus
Lugh epic epic battle for the ages
that's fine
I try I'm just gonna I'm gonna see if I
can like go out like with a training
dummy training here we go
like there's a whole training section
it's a let's be the Buddha Eric the Lord
says the first high school football game
was a lot like my first time having sex
I was bloody and soaring in but at least
my dad came
we're doing this now what
go to menu setup the second player
patroller be sure make sure it
recognizes the two
I don't see my family
from game bar
when I go to the games menus and see
go to the star since just emailed
factorio as a gift to you email highly
recommend factorial okay
top-down survival game what fun is
building a giant factory to automate the
shit that's usually tedious in survival
games
okay so this is light let's medium is
heavy and that's for all
okay
okay
fighting on grass well six weeks have
been a practice room yeah this is just a
if you see on the way left it shows me
all the buttons I'm president so I can
practice should the Buddha have a lot
more arms you think of Shiva Buddha only
had two
I would do this super super super move
is down towards down towards madam so
Stritch you could pick any god to be for
a day and could remember it and the
ultimate superpower grants the ability
so he won't let you be the almighty god
you'd have to pick the correct god who
you gots what
what's a correct gun
it's a code what is a crack guys yeah
something game audio too loud I can see
the bar relative dust is okay pause for
readjustment how do we feel about this
that should be fine so at any point will
be something that isn't this I do I have
a back-up plan
absolutely I thought we might be able to
get some comedy out of this well we have
to be able to play together
oh yeah well from learning how to play I
won't get I don't get to learn how to
play oh yeah you definitely won't figure
out the second controller then we could
learn together Jack I guess no I don't
want to know
don't want to open game bar you keep
making new
Dubey sandwich says this may be my last
tip and stream for the time being
giving hermas on my path gotta say you
guys picked a fitting game for the
situation thanks for the memories
hope I don't die but I may not you'll be
fine you'll be fine hey it works yeah oh
great
alright it works now well yeah yeah
Irma's coming man there will be a nubes
I'm gonna be Anubis erm is coming to
that's two hurricanes right in a row
their second boss form nature that's
Trey Zeus
random okay so light attack medium tech
heavy attack grab okay this is just like
your it's called like DPS I don't know
what that means and then it's like lock
not block block is just pressing away
from some okay this is like your shoot
button I think : I think if I nope or if
I press towards you and shoot nope
now did something with Buddha and then
you do you can press like down towards
in one of the attacks and that does a
special or towards down towards or okay
let's go and jump is just up
Anubis destroys you oh shit
shit Oh Zeus is more powerful than
Anubis oh you know we should we should
do an elimination tournament to see who
what you guys is the goal sir each God
and either side of them sure well you
know what we need we need a fair we need
a randomized bracket who get to buy the
first round you know that kind of stuff
what is one of the one of those someone
in chat want to make us a bracket we're
just just survivor like once Zeus is
dead yeah I have to pick a new character
once I lose the Zeus okay sure
he loses Anubis you have to pick a new
character to see who's the ultimate guy
we'll see who's the ultimate guy okay
cool whoever's left on the one side then
what we could we can we can pick amongst
them all right cool I like it
come up come here
rich you're a fighting game master how
do you do this special attacks with your
what special attacks where the screen
goes dark and I press something's about
to happen I press the trigger button
it's obviously not doing me much good
oh this game is so janky yeah I mean
this is listen oh sorry yeah this is
this is a lot of okay so now you guys we
did the top 2 so we did the Zeus in our
new booth so I guess you're the bottom
half on the top halfs I don't want to do
this sure sure alright alright so how
about Athena okay we'll see if Athena
can take you
Athena versus Zeus oh hey there you go
hey twice we're--aw don't worry we'll be
Jesus Jesus is in there I'm saving Jesus
for last this one was also like $3.50 so
that's what you get it's gotta be a way
to summon fucking lightning I'm soos
shit
really guess I need to be closer agree
to do that I don't even know how that
happened right Oh Zeus wins that's round
one it's round one
keep throwing my shield at you
stop it stop it
now Thunderbolts come here get him get
him

Christ yeah banish him - that's the
thing it gave me the power of corn
alright here it is
Jesus its wheat not corn uh yeah it's
wheat
yeah listen it's funner to say corn yeah
basically it's more fun than anyone yeah
corn is a funnier word Jesus versus
Jesus that's what we got going here I
love that that makes the whole game
worth it right there
Oh suck it Jesus
mega-girl oh come on Oh
came to nothing Christ see in three days
you get it because I was gonna kill you
see you in three days
Ron corn oh come on
make me waste my mega moves
oh holy lights the power of Christ
compels you
Oh mega corn
you can't hit all his corn and y'all
crucified won't do the super move this
is it was hard to do
oh okay is that it was that it was that
your last character sip that means that
means uh this lady right here is the
best of all gods all right syphilis but
you're out of wheat is the best of all
gods well god bless that cleavage right
listen all right so what no no this is
this is um unless you want to play this
anymore can we unlock stuff I'm done
with this yeah I know that's about what
we can get out of this right hold on we
can there's biographies
the central figure Christianity he is
regarded by most Christians as the Son
of God who died for the sins of his
people and who is resurrected after his
crucifixion character type close-range
combatant Jesus's variety of moves and
buffs gives rise to multiple tactics
forcing opponents into corners by
unleashing Holy Light is often the great
first step DPS resolution this recovers
Jesus's HP and bestows Jesus with a
damage buff to increase damage dealt
however this will also increase the
damage received this buff does not
disappear after it has been launched so
try to avoid using it if you're under
attack that's great well now I could
find out who some of these people are
like whose Guan gong the Taoists God of
War Guan gong Guan gong was a general
serving under the warlord lai bill I
know Lee oh boo because he's in Dynasty
Warriors he was defeated as early as the
CFI he was deified as early as this you
dynasty and is still worshipped by many
Chinese people his deeds and moral
qualities have been lionized and he is
also respected as an epitome of loyalty
and righteousness great who the fuck is
SIF the goddess of the fertility of the
earth shit yeah girl SIF was born a
second-generation goddess of Asgard she
is the wife of the Thunder God Thor and
is well known for her blinding golden
hair
scholars have proposed that sifts hair
represents fields of golden wheat and
that she is associated with fertility
family and wedlock wait was Siffin was
sick the girl fighter and Thor I don't
recall I think so the goddess of the
bounds right so his festival was SIF in
any of the Thor movies
yes that is lady oh really
so the warrior in the Thor movies is
Lady SIF epitome is not what I said
epitome huh epitome and I said episode
week just because I was reading oh sure
you're right absolutely all right well
shit sorry guys
we kind of know who Athena is who be the
goddess of the Sun and the universe
Amaterasu Amaterasu in full Amaterasu
omikami is the celestial sun goddess
from whom japanese imperial families
claim descent and as an important to
Shinto deity Matsui is often portrayed
with a bow and armor as she's holding no
okay well there you go
well shit now we know wait who's a new
basic god of death god of lost souls in
the helpless Anubis is the Egyptian god
of mummification and the afterlife as
well as the patron god of lost souls
come on
well shit there we go there's uh can
someone give me an uptight what's our
uptime on this
Jack finally got it close to right sorry
yeah I'm terrible with names and reading
Hugh really should be in this game that
would be great if Q was a was a fighter
what do you do
what boat Q's moveset big right it's
teleport one hour a minute he can
obviously he could teleport right it
would just turn you into whatever
instead of like summoning a dog or a
snake maybe he'd like Picard would run
out and run at you yes it's absolutely
ridiculous
all right well I'm good with an hour of
that if that's what we can get out of it
that was that was worth the $3.50 I paid
for it
oh it's cheap okay next game yes he was
worthless unless you can get John de
Lancie

[Part II]
got the bookmark and got the bookmark
I'm good what's what's what's next a
game in the docket okay I wanted to
check out this game which is called
silver grapple alright and it looks like
a really neat and grapple hook game
looks like Flint tuck it looks like
Flint took but instead of small
procedurally generated levels bigger
Oh God like okay move around and shit
levels and you know that's what that was
my problem with Flint hook is I felt
like it was too small and I wanted more
or fun stuff to do can you update in
jetty for me sure please the canno pic
jar were for a number each for the
safekeeping of a particular human organs
the stomach intestines love and lung and
liver all of which was believed would be
needed in the afterlife
alright so what's this called this is
called silver grapple which might have
crashed
so change name if you feel like it and
course grapples like horse apples
yeah you say I'm bad it they litter I
thought about it for literally three
seconds that's what you get for three
seconds Jack I'll take it I'll reject
not it was this character I mean god
shitty delivery for shitty joke I won
Carrick thing earlier now pick a god you
know what do fifty one can get me almost
a combo meal from anywhere there's no
particular God I want to be that I guess
I could be Yahweh for a day and make the
world not suck but your changes get
undone how does that work oh how do you
make the world not suck yeah yeah cuz
you think you making the world on sucks
make it sucks for a lot of other people
right that's that's the monkey paw logic
any wish any wish that you make will
have a will have unforeseen consequences
have you seen that Penn & Teller foolish
show yeah I've seen that it's neat
special you know the premise of the show
Penn & Teller fool us somebody does a
magic act and Penn & Teller watch hmm
and if Penn & Teller can't tell them how
the magic trick was done they they win
they win what are they win they get to
be they get to be like the opening act
for Penn & Teller in Las Vegas and
teller have a very famous time long
magic show in Vegas and yeah they win
the opening act if they don't know how
your trick was done and something like
I've seen some where they're just like
we think we know how it's done but we're
impressed enough where you're gonna be
basically it's a it's a way for them to
audition people while making money yeah
yes it's a it's a racket rich it's an
absolute racket
Jack you made this game right it looks
me it looks like I would a game I would
make was this game made by a
five-year-old I don't judge it on the
graphics style ah I'm just waiting for
me to get my grapple hook I wanna
grapple hook ah yeah you already missed
the previous game it was a fight of gods
and we had some fun with it
SIF no Schiff SIF was the SIF was the
was the best God is what we've
determined so if you if you have to pick
a religion take a religion that includes
SIF because that's the true religion
according to the fighting game that we
just played can I do a stream as Paul
Feig no that wig would bother the hell
out of me and I wouldn't want to wear
suits all stream either that would
prototype grapple getting a Hudson soft
vibe from this what less colorful maybe
than some of their old NES games
you swing not gameplay-wise just visual
I don't know why Hudson soft yeah okay
what games did they make milon's secret
castle or some others I forgot what they
were
shit
Adventure Island oh yeah that's the big
one jeezum don't mission milon's secret
castle and not venture island by oh man
I didn't know that did Bomberman I can
see it it's those eyes I know I'm
probably supposed to go in this door but
this thing is right over here I kind of
want to kind of want to go in here
nope
okay
so chat you could ask Jack this - it's a
great question for Jack
this is a hyper starts or ster days I
don't know francy ation great should
they watch the tick 2001 before 2017 you
can completely skip over the patrick
warburton tick here's my question
yeah and I thought I figured this would
you would instantly bring this up why
would you bring up the 2001 tick and not
the 1992 tip if you tick that we watched
a couple of those episodes the other day
my kids were all flavored up for the
cartoon tick and we saw some of the
greatest Saturday morning cartoon ever
produced the tick was the greatest show
ever Jim over the tick versus the big
nothing 92 is 94 whatever it was sorry
go ahead there there's an episode called
tick versus the big nothing and it's
where he gets kidnapped by aliens who
only speak in what and are battling a
alien race that only speak in hey and
there's a great scene where they're
trying to interrogate Arthur because he
looks just like the Hey
and so the entire a interrogator
interrogator goes what and he goes hey
nothing it's just hey in what for a
solid two and a half minutes genius
writing and you know what you don't need
to see that tick either before you see
the the Peter Serafinowicz tick yeah
there's not like a continuity thing that
you need to worry about right so you can
just start the the Serafinowicz tick and
and be happy but I really recommend
actually you probably should see that
first or else some of the some of the
jokes they reuse some jokes from the
cartoon and I think they're done a
little bit better in the cartoon hmm at
least in the pilot so watch these
Serafinowicz first and then the cartoon
but and it's hard to get your hands on
copies of the cartoon now people want up
a patch of Warburton one and not and not
the cartoon series were so weird to me
it's so weird to me and I don't know why
because I didn't think the Patrick
Warburton one was very good you know
and that I mean that could have just
been because I was coming fresh from you
know the only other tick is cartoon and
comic tape and the wow shit
and the the cartoon is more similar to
the comic book than anything that's
great so the cartoon in the comic book
are really similar and the Patrick
Warburton one is is almost like a sitcom
it's very strange no nobody saw the
cartoon tick no nobody saw the patrick
warburton tick it lasted four episodes
before it got canned the cartoon tick
went three seasons I'm gonna say four
Saturday morning cartoons of the time
was kind of a lot I'm gonna say a lot of
people know cartoon tick
rich I recently bought XCOM 2 and I'm
getting my shit kicked in
any tips I loved one Evolver died I
don't I don't have anything specific I
can tell you off the top of my head I
know I got my teeth kicked in when I
started playing
XCOM 2 and I I can't think of any one
amazing tip for you off the top of my
head I'm I'm sorry but I know if you if
you keep at it it will come absolutely
heck even me and I'm not a strategy
person I made it to the very end of XCOM
2 you just have to figure it out you can
do it we believe in you how much both
version of the ticket find your set and
you know what if you really need a fix
find yourself some comics man's those
old comics were great I've only ever saw
that one tick episode that was on Amazon
a year ago I think it was the pilot for
the new one but I really didn't get it
at all what exactly is the tick about so
it's a spoof how would you know how do
you describe the tick the tick the tick
is it - Sean the tick is - superhero
movies what Shaun of the Dead is -
zombie movies okay it is both a satire
of the genre while being a good
representation of the genre the tick
loves wallowing in the absurdities of
just the idea of a superhero yes the
tick is just a big dumb do-gooder and
he's not even incompetent but he lives
in his own fantasy world right here he
is the he is the the exaggeration of
every old-fashioned superhero ever
exactly and like back in the day you
would never worry about what a superhero
did to like pay the rent yeah but that's
whole episodes of the tick is they just
need to figure out how to pay the rent
that month because they live in Arthur's
and a
apartment he sleeps on a couch it's
Britt the tick is wonderful it's it's a
it's a if you love superhero stuff watch
the tick because it's it's a loving poke
he will say old chum and he will be
completely serious when he says yep he
he will after an adventure he will go
off on some kind of like long rambly
thing that he thinks is the moral of the
story but it's just kind of crazy but
his hearts into it right he like he
wants to give the big final epilogue but
he doesn't know what to say so he just
says stuff and isn't that what it's all
about Chum we're sitting here in the
paint mixer of life a little bit of
green a little bit of blue put us
together and we're a big paint explosion
yeah and and so while the cartoon is a
skewering of classic comic books the new
one is a skewering of modern day like
dark and i call it a bigger skewering
yeah okay a little bit of Marvel a
little bit of DC I haven't seen much
you've seen a lot more and I usually
watch series I've seen the pilot and
some of an episode at your house right
so it's it's it's probably equal yeah if
you're looking for the directed skewer
it's actually probably skewing the
Netflix shows more as far as tone but
yeah it digs that Knoll in a little bit
it digs at like daredevil it digs it a
lot of things
I'm here because big clown hit me I
remember that
why are you here fighting that whole
clown proto clown proto clown he just
got knocked into orbit and landed on
Galactus was that that was like GLaDOS
up no no that the so he proto clown
knocked him into the stratosphere and
that was his journey of self-discovery
okay okay where he went on it he went on
a Vision Quest and to like the different
parts of his mind I got them mixed up I
was thinking that was the one where he
ended up living on Galactus for a while
omnipotence
I'm the yeah yeah yeah I'm nipa toes and
and he he ended up living at an
omnipotence because he was on a mission
he was on the moon and he was blowing up
the CH a from when chair face
Chippendale carved his name into the
part of his name before he stopped right
it was a running joke in the series and
we're spoiling it huh and we're spoiling
that this is a 20 year old cartoon if
someone has not seen it by this point
all right in the background on the
ticket during any kind of night scenes
if you see the moon the moon has a see
an age and part of an egg carved into it
from an episode when a villain was
trying to carve his name into the moon
and kind of got halfway done before you
get foiled before tick stops um yeah
that's that's the first episode the
first Jeff a Chippendale first mate
first episode was the EMM I remember is
the idea men who are you right what's
the big idea well we're gonna steal a
lot of money and then we'd never have to
work again that was the big idea meant
that was a big plot we're gonna steal a
lot of money and we're never gonna have
to work again you fiends
you might be right rich
you just might be right
he I remember them very well because I
love to tick - takes great shape
shit
just trying to remember it's just
incomplete and gonna damn it I need to
re-watch the tick cartoon yeah you do
rich is right and that could be I'm now
I'm not discounting riches correctness
which is 98% right all the time which is
what I might not see Star Wars 8 anymore
since orchard thief I don't know that I
ever said Star Wars 8 is going to be bad
I'm not super excited about it but I'm
just not that interested though I'm
worried about something like isn't it
weird that we haven't seen a big fancy
second trailer for episode 8 the last
Jedi is it weird that we haven't seen a
big second trailer yet yeah maybe when
does it come out you know just a few
months December what else what else is
coming out Disney wise big yeah nothing
as far as I know between now and
December Thor are they I'm just I'm
trying to I'm trying to talk it through
here are they are they not why isn't
Thor out yeah that's so weird well it
cuz it's not I don't know how to answer
that question Richard so it felt like it
should be a summer movie Jack summer you
know movies don't need to be summer
movies to be summer months true nurse
here's what I'm thinking they don't have
anything to show no nothing exciting to
show for the big action trailer
I got a you know my you know my thinking
is you know we were the last one was
just a new hope again yeah this is just
gonna be Empire again and they're not
showing us anything because 80% of the
movie
is literally just Luke talking to Ray on
that planet teaching her to be a Jedi
there's nothing to be nothing exciting
to see no cuz they're still like like
there were trailers for Empire right
like 90% of that movies gonna be rape
talking to Luke at an island which hey
Empire was great so it might be good
anyway but I don't maybe there's just
not the big action exciting thing to
show Phil it's still a Star Wars movie
they're gonna there's gonna be space
battles there's gonna be fighting my oh
my only guess is they're given Aereo is
that they're given Thor some breathing
room or waiting for like due to have
like a what do they call it do they have
like a an event happening like a like a
Star Wars Celebration they already have
that I don't I don't know because if
they have some sort of celebration where
they can turn it not only into a trailer
but into a fan experience like Comic Con
just happened so it's not comic-con
but maybe something of the like maybe
something of the like where where
they're waiting you know it's it's
they're gonna unveil it at a Star Wars
extravaganza check are they are they
still going through with in d5 and as
Harrison Ford's so going to be in it I
think it just got it just got a
announced that Shia LaBeouf is not in it
mut is not featured in it is Harrison
Ford gonna be running around as a 70
year old like a 75 year old man I really
really hope not I really hope not I
don't want to see that right all right
are they saying yes are they saying
that's what's gonna happen
seems like shit I'll get ready Jack I
don't have to do shit man I have to shit
about shit if I don't wanna watch Anna
Jones I don't have to see it which they
will probably de-age him it doesn't
matter you take a few years off somebody
but how are you gonna how are you gonna
make Harrison Ford look 30 for an entire
movie and have it also not look kind of
creepy yeah you can DA someone for like
a scene how are you gonna do jazz old
man walk digitally remove his cane
replace Harrison Ford with Chris Pratt
just talked about that but just making
new franchisee at that point yeah and
it's just not Indiana Jones not Harrison
Ford it could I think it could be I I'm
not as I'm not as Stern about that I
don't know about Pratt
I mean Pratt would he Pratt would do a
more he would do star-lord you know
which is a bit more jokey aloof that's
his thing yeah who'd be good that would
be good as an indie isn't that many
people out there like Harrison Ford yeah
you would need someone not you need
someone a little more dignified than
Chris Pratt I think to pull off an
Indian do we all right
all these questions of well whether or
not it could good practice and no one's
asking the obvious question is why do we
need this at all
a need is a different question than will
they do it Oh apparently it's just an
assumption that we needed no it's an
assumption that they're gonna do it
whether we need it or not which i think
is an activism then the next question is
why do I have to pay any attention to it
you don't you know you don't have to do
nothing and stop bugging me about it you
shit out shit
yeah
well makes less sense now and all the
fans of the indie movies we're all old
make something for the kids kids don't
care about Indiana Jones true dat
kids want to see moulting nazi faces hey
yeah I was a kid I did yeah that was
awesome
once again it was okay because it was an
odd scene always
come on
you know the burglar who killed Uncle
Ben he gets his face melted off and oh
he probably didn't deserve that he's
prone to jail yeah any any any random
Nazi like he just signed the Nazi
paperwork and he hasn't actually done
any Nazi stuff yet he's just affiliated
he put on the uniform and it just put on
some dude agree puts on the Nazi uniform
egos you know this looks pretty good
absolutely so I see Fritz is that you
are ready to become an SS off almost
didn't I secrets that you're ready to
become an SS officer if you could just
sign this paperwork it's and we'll order
your your face mouth Belloc's face
didn't melt his head exploded
the lock wasn't a Nazi he was a Nazi
collaborator but he didn't care we give
a shit about the Nazis he he just wanted
to find that art he was a sellout but he
worked with the Nazis so I didn't care
that his head exploded he tried on that
uniform now those other guys were
definitely Nazis and their face melted
so
they got it do modern-day Nazis root for
when they're watching Raiders our Last
Crusade right do they actually Ruta get
order they actually root against
Indiana's dad that's a fine question
yeah ask a Nazi yeah that is a fine
question do they just watch those movies
and got that Indiana Jones hopefully
hopefully somebody will melt their
fucking face and it's just not an issue
I see I see
oh we're way up catching up to do here
catch up bridge oh yeah oh yeah the
riddle of Steel says I don't want to
demoralize your progress at pub G there
isn't it I'm not playing pub cheeks but
you need to watch a video of a guy
winning while role-playing as hitman
white shirt no backpack or armor only a
pistol hunting other players and you
know as of as of today I'm officially
done yeah
as of today specific today specifically
I am officially done with pub G can I
say it's odd that that game you could
not recommend yeah you were still
playing it up until today oh you know
what I play like a game of day and like
you know cuz I was I was what I was
really doing I was attempting to better
myself because I know we have fun
streaming it yeah it's like oh you know
if we stream it again I don't want to
horribly embarrass myself even though I
know that's yes where the comedy comes
I'll tell you what your biggest problem
is yeah it's the run out into the open
to draw them out strat well is that that
is not worked well once never worked I'm
trying to learn you know where it's like
I had it I had a death where I I saw a
motorbike but you know that one of those
buildings where it has the lower part in
the upper part ride shotgun that guy saw
a motorbike right next to us I knew a
guy was right in the upper area cuz I
could see the windows in the lower area
and so I opened the door but I don't go
in right away hoping that he would shoot
first and while he was reloading running
he didn't shoot so then I just kind of
like yeah I'll just go in and see if I
can see him and I saw him but I sound
too late he was hunkered behind a desk
right yeah it was like okay learning
from this mistake I always forget
grenades next time I should have thrown
a grenade I should use that more anyway
you know I'm really trying to better
myself at the game I'm playing this
afternoon
uh-huh and I have a nice shotgun with
the shotgun choke that's adorable
what oh he's mopping dorable he's
mopping he's taking time to mop all I'm
telling a pub G story so
I've landed a great spot find a vehicle
like I've really learned about the early
game looting and like you really have
more time you can find a vehicle usually
like yeah get far away from the airplane
fot loot find a vehicle right and I get
within the circle I have on a level
three vest a level two helmet a coat all
this good stuff a shotgun with the choke
on it a nice machine gun with a good
scope yeah and I'm in the second floor
of this building and I see a dude coming
towards me because the circles closing
in yeah I got this rich yeah fucking got
this he gets close to the house no cover
I hit him three I'm on the second floor
so it weighs away yeah I hit him three
times with my shotgun he does not have a
vest on three times with my shotgun
doesn't go down he opens my front door
so I was like I'll just go over and
finish him off go to the front door hit
him a fourth time with my shotgun he
hits me once with a shotgun yep I'm down
yeah I
he's at the bottom he's out the door at
the bottom of the stairs I'm at the top
of the stairs oh one shot with a shotgun
and I'm down and it it was so
demoralizing because I felt like I was
making progress in learning the game and
just fucking done any everyone wanted to
play for the review that's that's pretty
much how every one of my sessions with
the sessions with the game ended
ragequitting some kind of bullshit yeah
and that's how most of my sessions end
is that maybe I'll get one or two games
in but he but yeah they'll always end in
bullshit and so I think I'm done with it
maybe when the new maps come out maybe
but I'm pretty sure I'm done with it now
the worgen i new maps yeah are you sure
your aim just didn't suck I saw the
blood spurts I hit him four times with a
shotgun
he had no vest on
blocky straight-up bull hockey my
friends
gone great
whose idea was it for the little pig to
get riding at Twinkie that that's Mike's
joke that was mine it's not even a joke
my doubts I'll guarantee you mike has no
fucking idea what Adventure Time is
that's my kid that was a Christmas
ornament of mine an adventure themed
Christmas ornament and I brought it when
we had brought all of our nerd stuff and
Mike made that good joke so I let I let
them keep the Twinkie the pig riding the
Twinkie I'll guarantee you Mike wasn't
kidding though no not mrs. hijack we
ever returned to half in the bag I would
love to hear your thoughts about the
next Avengers and explain all the
millions of things Mike and Jay don't
understand or care about but that is not
a question for me half in the bag is
Mike and Jason right and if they invite
me on I will of course be on but you
know not my call my friends yep not my
call at all
how old is Mike he's somewhat younger
than me he just doesn't give a fuck
about your car - and I'm sorry Mike is
an adult man what are you saying what do
you think I'm not
Shauna had 1897 says hey rich and Jack
hi are you guys planning spooky games
for spooked Ober also will you summon
Jay back from Hell to partake and the
Spooky's spook so much much like me
choosing whether to be on half in the
bag Jay chooses whether he comes or not
he has an open invitation and he knows
this and a lot of times he will come and
you know we'll have a great I'm not sure
I understand I don't know if I
understand this puzzle yet either oh I
think I get it a lot of this game is
like is like portal with grappling hooks
where you just need to figure out the
room puzzle yeah okay yeah shit does Jay
play games at all not really probably
ever so slightly more than Mike but Mike
plays them zero percent of the time Jay
it might be point zero two percent right
I've Jay's been by for like a few board
game nights
why does Mike hate fun Mike just finds
different things fun preach it rich
preach it shit shit
shadow sword master says came up the
grant work thank you
thank you very much shadow certain
master so I suppose first spooky games
isn't like half the question that's more
your thing than mine or you get it in
your head that we need a spooky theme
and I'm like alright would it be spooky
if we dedicate October to X come to
would that be super spooky well see
we'll see here's the thing I still
didn't finish my X come one playthrough
but I said I was gonna finish really
yeah oh shit man that would be sucky the
the streamed one you know but I think
people want to see the new dlc of course
so I don't know what to do if I should I
don't know if we should stream some more
of the chosen the new thing or finish
the old rum which I said I was going to
do I I would default to wait to clarify
I finished
XCOM like dozens of times I mean I had
to play through that I was streaming and
I was gonna stream a full playthrough of
the first next calm we clarify that all
right sorry gut gut feeling tells me
were the chosen the more people want to
see that yeah because they've see
already seen a lot of you playing X come
so X that one but I could be wrong
oh I see
what am I waiting for being in the mood
well for a while you're waiting to stop
playing Mario Rabbids which we were
doing for the show yeah we just filmed
that episode so now you and now you have
no excuse seems more annoying than Flynn
tuck no no this is exactly what I wanted
from foot hook which is alright alright
platforming challenges revolving around
a grappling hook yeah
like flint hook also promised like enemy
battles which you know this could but
yeah this is this is different beasts
where all this is is platforming
challenges with a grappling hook and I
super dig it except for I'm not very
good at it got a time it we've got a
time it just right
Karam Miller says I both computer over
the weekend and it didn't post so I've
been troubleshooting for the past week
and just now got it to work so Cheers
it's a mini ITX like Jax congratulations
motherfucker some other board it's
always the motherboard right was it the
motherboard I gotta like go for it
faster why'd you gotta swear it rich cuz
I swear
naturally the swearing is Rich's default
state yeah anything else you get is like
gravy
as the lego still holding up Jack's
video you fucking know it is Doctor Doom
but up says hey guys has either one of
you seen Netflix glow I'm not much into
wrestling but the show gave me a much
better understanding of the fascination
got better with each episode huge
recommendation I started washing it with
Karen we didn't decide we hated it we
just kind of lost interest you know Lisa
and I were looking for a show to watch
yeah you know Game of Thrones is over
and we'd finished up the defenders and
all all the other shows and I
recommended that to her cuz she really
likes orange is the new black right and
she says actually you know one of these
nights you're streaming I wash it today
I'm gonna care for it and I was like oh
I don't guess I guess so yeah that's
what I've heard about glow is here's
what I can tell you I am NOT gonna watch
anymore Twin Peaks I watched the first
two episodes yeah and I didn't really
care for them if you watch the original
I love the orig here's here's my thing
and Chad is about to beat me up but I
think I've talked about this before I'm
actually not a big David Lynch fan okay
I find I really like his straight-laced
stuff with touches of weird like like
twin peaks' like his like Elephant Man
which isn't a very David Lynch II film
that's a very straight for are you going
to spoil anything I mean I'm chatter
freaking out no no spoilers no spoilers
all I will say completely spoiler free
is this is more David Lynch than
original Twin Peaks its original Twin
Peaks is just this hard-boiled detective
story with little sprinkles of David
Lynch weirdness yeah he's you know this
is pure David Lynch and it's - David
Lynch for me alright so so we watched
the first episode oh and and we're like
well maybe it'll get more Twin Peaks and
then we watch the second episode and we
said nope
this is a David Lynch movie and I can
absolutely understand why J or I mean
frankly why anyone likes it who is a fan
of David Lynch cuz shit is it David
Lynch we need a we need an expiration
date on spoiler Twin Peaks spoilers the
season just ended and so I'll say as of
next week's next week's well if
someone's been waiting to binge you
should give them time to binge okay so
not this upcoming Sunday okay but the
next Sunday the next Sunday is when we
can start full-blown Twin Peaks spoilers
and then that's gonna be in the check I
haven't watched it you've apparently
only watched a couple episodes and I
don't care so ya know if Jay shows up I
guess before then for whatever reason
that and then it's that'll be game on
absolutely so so Sunday after next door
till the next J stream whichever comes
first
yeah and so you know like I have no ill
will towards anyone who likes it I
understand completely why you would like
it but I'm just not a big David Lynch
fan I've he David Lynch loves RT and
abstract and I really like stories with
a purpose and meaning and so I didn't
much care there was a lot of really neat
ideas in the first two episodes but I
just didn't care that much that's
probably why we haven't had a J stream
in a while isn't it well it's every it's
been every Sunday there's been an
episode so if he was thinking about
coming on Sunday at least so that
immediately halves the amount of
possible the amount of possible J but
now that it's over we'll see this seems
more irritating than anything else this
is watching this well you got to get the
right flow this is bullshit precision ah
this doesn't look like a game though
like you never have like a nice
free-flowing playthrough just whoops
whoops I didn't do the the pixel-perfect
shit well yeah this it's not it's not a
free flow playthrough kind of game I
didn't I didn't hit that corner
absolutely perfectly whoops
rotating to play let's I mean I disagree
is this is the kind of game that I
really can enjoy where you just find the
right thing to do and you you get the
right reflexes
I would love a kind of a mix between
this and Flint hook where there are like
bigger Flint hook levels and enemies to
fight where it can be a little more
forgiving okay okay but just as a puzzle
platformer I'm really down with this
nope it's tough but you know what else
it's really fun swinging around
get me some spider-man downloadable
costume and I am good to go the riddle
of Steel says superhero question okay
given that Superman / kal-el is not
human does that mean he is technically
MA and pot' Kent's pet as opposed to
their adopted child does this nullify
his marriage to Lois no Pitts Pitts
the marriage thing is debatable I don't
I don't think he qualifies as a pet
though a pet is the dump that's the
dumbest thing I've ever I certainly
don't think mom can't see him as a pet
no at very least he's an illegal
well the marriage thing that's an
interesting argument yeah now I am Pro
Superman being able to marry Lois Lane
of course but he wasn't human
that's what I'm saying he's an illegal
alien he immigrated here illegally you
know you know what well not to get too
political do you know what Superman is
yeah he's a dreamer he was brought here
he was brought here as a child you know
you know John Brian he didn't have any
say whether he came to John Brian got
around that yeah yeah technically
Kryptonians don't give birth they grow
their kids and vats oh so when he landed
on earth that was just basically
technically his birth
he was never he was growing in his
little fetal thing on his way here oh is
a natural born US citizen thanks to a
technicality that's funny
so I get like depending on the Canon
right right depending on the Canon he
might be an illegal citizen that is
doesn't see you've done ignore the fact
that he looks human let's pretend he's
got eight tentacles and like no eyes and
and a stark he's on a big stock okay
great
do human was applied to an alien did
human laws yes of course they do though
you know what it's the it's a dog have
to follow though to bathe along a dog is
not human right the amount of sang-soo
purring there's the owner but a dog
doesn't have consciousness just at a
technical level and the owner of a dog
has to suffer the consequences if a dog
breaks the law yeah so and a lot of
times if the dog but if a dog breaks a
law it can be put down assuming this
eight tentacled green horrible stock
monster has consciousness they have to
follow the rules of the land
absolutely absolutely that's how it
works rich Superman has to follow all
the laws and really it's it's moot
points because technically Clark Kent
has a birth certificate so you're
agreeing Superman is a pet I'm saying
I'm saying if you want to argue
technicalities you might have an
argument but he's a pet I certainly
would say that MA and pas can do not see
Superman as being a pet they see him as
an adopted child of course well and like
I said that's why it's really moot
because because they forged a birth
certificate for him and so he has all
the correct paperwork right yeah so you
know as long as the world never knows
he's Clark Kent it doesn't matter
laws are not written for humans they are
written for persons Clark Kent is
clearly a person yeah all right
he bought all right but Superman would
have to take a citizenship test and you
know is an illegal alien say aliens ever
did if aliens ever did come to earth
this would be the kind of question that
lawyers would have to wrestle with oh
man all honesty of course and like one
judge would have to make a call yeah
yeah so like start precedent absolutely
yeah
I know some of the people on the chat
are talking about animals and sentient
snow oh shit
Jack grew up on a farm you know do you
know what they do to animals on a farm
and and and if you grow up around that
just just for the sake of your sanity
you have to view animals a certain way
I'll also like you even like if dogs and
cats have emotions or whatever there's a
big difference between like having like
the ability to be happy and sentience
that humans have let's just settle down
and you know what if you if you eat
hamburgers you have to be okay with this
course cows are just like big dogs
that's all cows are their big lovable
dogs that you turn into meat I have just
I have just kind of accepted that cows
are tasty and I just don't think about
it at all honestly that's how I deal
with it wait did you come with don't
make me do this puzzle again
what about Krypto the Superdog
yeah it's Krypto sentient I haven't read
that much Krypto you tell me he's Krypto
sentient I believe he is like he can
have a conversation with you I don't
know buddy he lacks the ability to talk
but mute people are sentient I well you
know what I meant like like he could can
I believe you could tell Krypto to do a
thing he would understand what you were
saying and be able to do it yes is he
able to like I think you could give him
like complicated instructions and he
would go go do it so now we're now we're
talking about what's the definition of
sentience like is he able to make his
own decisions is he able to care for
himself okay he's a dog you know like
you can't get his own food super dog
could probably get his own food even if
it meant he had to rip your throat out
because he was starving and there was
nothing else to eat he could easily do
it I mean you're not wrong you're not
wrong rich
you might Google what it means to be
sentient Jack right that's what I'm
saying Jesus I am in Hell watching this
great welcome to hell
what about that cat which got a Red
Lantern ring on its tail or something
like that
did they pretty much all animals get
their own food it's how they live this
is very accurate oh well I mean well now
you're just being semantically huh what
did you mean honestly I was thinking
like going to the grocery store
because I'm so removed from the farm now
that's how I think about kidding it's
like to me to me I was like picturing
like a crypt I'll go to a restaurant no
like you know like of course in nature
Jesus what if he could he just said what
if we just didn't want to what to what
go to the store right well I get
basically what I'm saying is this is
we're having a different conversation
here whether or not crypto I don't know
Kryptos mental facilities is I guess
okay the point of it I have not read any
crypto comic books
Jack I'm supposed to tell you that there
was another door to the right oh my god
how long have you been doing oh no I got
out of it but then I accidentally hit a
platform and I'm like I got it to the
end of the puzzle but then I
accidentally did something wrong and now
I'm trying to get back here we go okay
there we go I'm waiting for someone to
dig up this place and said hell
Oh see I got her already but the
question you want to ask is does Krypto
have a theory of mind does he realize
other people have thoughts of their own
I'm pretty sure Krypto does hasn't crypt
opened depicted with like thought
bubbles on occasion
it's like Silver Age or anything you
know I know these really exist these
days in any form we would recognize as
Krypto
he sure saying he used to talk crypto
used to talk yeah we'll see then then
you got yourself a question like then
yes he is sentient right if he's a
talking dog that's like all right any
any thoughts on the original Moloch the
first minute black film I like it a lot
I love men in black Mike hates ed I
think his real reason for hating it is
that he wanted to see the subject
material of the men the mysterious men
in black done seriously I think Mike is
upset is mostly just upset that it was a
comedy
oh you think yeah yeah I thought it was
great movie I really like the minibike
it's a fine film did you guys talk about
The Trevor arose departure from Star
Wars 9 yet the director of Star Wars 9
the part of the film before they even
really started me oh no I don't give a
fuck it's just a stupid Star Wars movie
yeah we find someone else it was and
honestly like I'm not super upset that
the guy who made Jurassic world is not
making another movie oh darn like when I
heard this news I don't even think it
like lit up anything in my brain it's
just something I like heard huh and my
mind registered that as the thing I
heard but I had no thoughts about it
what does this mean for Star Wars I know
okay that's the thing it happened
he left the film over fear of being
reviewed by planket ah he's got a career
to think about
oh yeah that I just can't care I can't
care about Colin Trevorrow how long have
you hated Star Wars since 1999 I see
it's not a matter of hating Star Wars
cuz I I don't like the original films
quite a lot yeah the original truly yeah
the original trilogy is great I just I
just don't think it's a very good
franchise because most of what they've
done the vast majority of everything
with the Star Wars name on it other than
the original trilogy has been either
terrible or just like a waste of
repetitive waste of time so yeah we're
retraining this again you know yeah I'm
with you I'm with you they'll find
another director everything will be fine
so I don't know if you could say yeah I
had Star Wars since I do like the
original films hmm I like a handful of
the games not not the majority of them
but like everyone knows I love TIE
fighter yeah that is a thing we know
about you as a thing to keep milking
though I I don't think the I don't think
the franchise is deep enough to warrant
it because we're gonna see the same shit
over and over again exactly like we have
and you know when they did try to do new
things with the prequels it was awful so
I don't I just I just think Star Wars
isn't a very good franchise like
specifically
outcast is great yeah I would label
outcast is one of the one of the games
that I like Jedi Outcast and a lot of
the things that the Star Wars fans seem
to love Jedi Jedi Jedi lightsaber
lightsaber lightsaber yeah doesn't do
all that much for me it's fine in
smaller doses but the Jedi lithology and
all the Jedi Knights I whatever I the
boring they're boring so I guess I'm I
am NOT a Star Wars fan in the sense that
I don't I don't think I like the things
that Star Wars fans tend to lump I
remember I remember them I remember I
remember when I realized oh I'm not a
Star Wars fan it was sometime around the
prequels but it wasn't the prequels
themselves that did it at that time as
far as I was concerned the prequels were
just bad movies yeah but I remember
there was a book I tried reading one or
two of the books okay I read like the
courtship of Princess Leia is like Oh
Han Solo and Leia flying around in the
Falcon that's gonna be fun I like the
Empire Strikes Back I'll see what they
do and they crash land on a planet full
of Jedi witches and it's Jedi Jedi force
force forest and Luke shows up and Jedi
Jedi Jedi Jedi Jedi and I was
complaining that on a forum like why is
there always this Jedi Jedi Jedi shit
you know god that's awful and someone's
like would be Thor wars with all the
Jedi stuff huh and I was like I read
that comment and like multiple comments
agreeing with this guy and it was just
like oh Star Wars isn't for me I'm not
really a fan right right right
you know yeah yes and yes
Jedi witches that road ran course it was
like the most disgusting shit it could
have possibly been fanfiction Oh God and
that was the book that made me realize I
don't actually like Star Wars all that
much as a franchise I one of the one of
the you've said a lot of smart things
rich but one of the smartest is your
asportation that it's a very limited
universe Star Wars by by hook or by
crook it is a limited universe
what about rebels rich I haven't I
haven't even gone out of my way to watch
it I've seen a couple episodes of rebels
because you know I have kids I I don't
care I don't care enough to seek it out
and it's it's cute it's fine it's not
the greatest but you know it's fine
is that animated or is not the
live-action thing they're talking about
doing for ages it's animated okay it's a
it's you know like 3d animation computer
animation and you know it's a little
ugly but you know and it's it's a it's
but it's also like about Jedi's it's not
necessarily oh god they go fuck off you
know like it actually starts off way
more interesting because it's about like
a group of space this was before there
was a rebellion huh and it's just about
a group of pirates like space pirates
and they find this kid on a planet and
the kid like helps them with the heist
and like yeah come on kid joeís we're
spaceflight we got a Mandalorian we got
a lady with the ear thing yeah come on
come on space pirates adventure and then
like five episodes in it's like I'm also
he's a Jedi and you're a Jedi too now um
yep yeah it was like immediately
they were doin eyes what book is rich
talking about the courtship of princess
lay out husband I'll see how hot am I I
got hitched kind of fun exciting
smuggler adventure do they go on Jedi
Jenna Jenna Jenna Jedi force force force
Jedi Jedi force force Jedi lightsaber
rancor awful Oh rancor and awful
um
still behind oh wow shag Rahad 1897 says
I know that rich isn't a big whore guy
but if you two can pick your favorite
horror video game what would you go with
just curious
keep up the good work stole at don't
know what that means
I suppose thief gave me an actual scare
back in the day so I'm gonna say thief
no you can't categorize that as a horror
game I felt a palpable sense of not not
dread but creepiness playing through
that sure and unease that counts
the real lip voices how much fun is it
to buy all those Star Wars toys from
nerd crew and write them off as a
business expense it's actually horribly
embarrassing now I don't buy the cream
of the crop those are built specifically
to be on a set where the joke is we have
all this nerdy toy crap around
so my criteria when buying that shit
is is how big is it like how visible
will it be and is it cheap right because
also you guys can destroy stuff and yeah
you're not you're not looking for the
best of the best like small things have
to be cheap big things like it needs to
be big enough that I think it's worth
that the expenditure like it's 50 yeah
that's pretty big it won't be big in the
frame that it goes so it's not like my
fantasy shopping did you glitch someday
that would be a speed runner who uses
this trick to bypass 2/3 of the game I'm
gonna send this clip to the game dev go
excuse me
it's it like I'm lost anyway and I don't
know how to I don't know where to go
I'll use my pocket teleporter I remember
being in line for that first load of
toys we got the nerd crew set and just
guy I was like someone really likes Star
Wars and just like Democrat how
embarrassing is this I'm sorry rich I'm
sorry that you're embarrassed by your
profession Jay frisk 2 says hey guys
late for the stream
I was playing strafe and died the final
boss that permadeath is bullshit anyways
Jack how far have you made it into Twin
Peaks which we answered that's so long
ago that's fair I got two episodes in
and it's far too David Lynch II for me
so it is what it is what it is my friend
all right there we go
Holocaust denier in the chat bannard
time out is it a joke it was this one
like ban yeah ban ban ban we don't got
time for that shit
alright listen we don't got time for
that shit if it's a joke it's a it's a
bad enough joke to get a ban yep you're
gone did you ban him yeah great gone
sorry son
ain't got time for that shit like so
many melts is fucking face/off alright
um as far as the permit death then
strafe oh my god
amazing exciting though permit death is
being bullshit I mean in strength yeah
in any game in any roguelike permadeath
is what makes the wind worth it
I love permadeath and games I mean it
can work in some games you know I can
you know in game in a game like strafe
man yeah you get to that final boss and
who dog oh you win and strafe and you
you win that's a that's an earned win
John I'm aware they might just be
trolling either way I'm glad to see them
gone that's uh you know that arrays
right there not a trial worth drawing
the friends west coast 76 says I hate
Illinois Nazis fine reference I I think
we can both agree with Elwood blues on
that one
everybody hates Illinois Nazis
what
nice
shit
ha
Oh Shh Feridun 2772 or 2772 so hey rich
I don't drink so I know your pain
there's a few bucks to maybe try
Cheerwine if you like a good cherry soda
also what do you think of my
illustration happy to do more which
illustration is yours did you do did you
do the our new background image if
you're talking about the new background
image we made it our new background
image because I liked it
we're with you mr. glitch who says fuck
those shitty Nazi lol edge Lord fuck
heads there you know there was a there's
a time I think in everybody in
everybody's life where you hit that like
I'm just gonna say something that's
gonna get people riled yeah and you know
like it's a phase that people got to get
through and I'm sorry if we're not being
helpful helping I mean we're being
helpful getting you through that phase
by making sure you know that that's
unacceptable here get through that phase
it's obnoxious
they were joking around about mounting
Nazis faces off earlier yes I still love
watching Nazis get their faces melted
off but that was like an hour ago yeah
if you're still talking about it now
yeah yeah yeah you're doing something
wrong hey fuck it I'm moving on I'm
moving on I'm done with that great not a
sense do you think the Indiana Jones
movies could work with different actors
and different adventures stories in the
same way the James James Bond movies
have worked I don't personally think so
but I'm not gonna say I can't be proven
wrong I think they could I think they
could without a doubt without fucking
doubt and I am I am I am far less
certain hey Harrison Ford's great and
those those original Indiana Jones Jones
in and of himself is not a strong enough
character it's all it's all Harrison
Ford that makes that word you
get it that's what makes him replicable
James Bond is not necessarily a strong
character that were true any of the
hundreds of Indiana Jones knockoff
movies in the 80s would have been
successful they weren't as good do you
remember national treasure I tell I
never saw national treasure you remember
King Solomon's Mines the the thing that
makes it replicable is that he's such a
stock character
do you remember what else in there Oh
God
it worked it worked for James Bond it
can work for Indiana Jones who's kind of
riffing on that iconic character because
Indy was kind of fallible unlike your
generic 19th buddy cereal man the
American man does everything right he
knows what works in the world he's tough
guy Indiana Jones will have shit blow up
in his face
things will go wrong yeah he'll get
punched in the face and he'll do that
that that Colin rubberface thing is
fallible yeah I don't know I think I
think too much of Indiana Jones is
Harrison Ford making it work
possibly
possibly but I really think it could be
hey I think it could be and I think it
should be it's a balancing act between
badass charming and and goofy mm-hmm yep
I think it could be and I think it
should be I would it you know an Indiana
Jones sequel remake thing is going to
happen I would much rather see the torch
handed off to a different actor playing
Indiana Jones than old Anna Jones just
because they're going to make it doesn't
mean it's going to work then that's our
core then it's even a good idea that
canted they both be true now once again
I could be proved wrong I'm I'm not
super excited about the idea though I
think it's okay to let franchises live
let sleeping franchises live absolutely
I agree with you we don't we don't have
to keep making everything until we want
to throw up this is why we still have
alien movies
and it was shocking they made two Alien
films work that one's kind of magic now
they've been dragging that franchise
through the broken glass for the last 20
years
sometimes you get mad max fury road it's
true well here's the question though was
it was it Mel Gibson that made those
movies work or was just the world was it
George Miller was it George Miller yeah
and I what we've probably learned is
that it was George Miller and like I
said I think I think that that's another
thing though that spiel Indiana Jones
the Spielberg of course so was Crystal
Skull but keep keep beating that dead
horse look look I just I answer the
questions we get asked
it's the chat that beats the horse no
Renaissance caveman says catching up on
streams at work all the Friday the 13th
streams inspired me to watch every one
of the movies over Labor Day weekend
Labor Day weekend here's a couple of
bucks for being the best part of the
franchise thank you thank you very much
so nice backhanded compliment to Friday
the third I'll say it
the riddle of Steel says crypto has
super canine intelligence equal to a
human according to Wikipedia don't the
deaf-mute get rights it's about humanity
guess my Superman pet the question
wasn't so silly huh well yeah now and
now that an if Krypto has the intent
intelligence equal to that of a human
then absolutely Krypto deserves human
rights absolutely
what show movie scared you most when you
were baby rich says Philadelphia Night
of the Living Dead by a mile the creepy
concept of all of the corpses everywhere
just getting up and trying to eat people
combined with the fact that there is
nowhere to run and you are absolutely
doom no God easily Night of the Living
Dead I couldn't watch those movies for
years that's very surprising yeah but
but I mean you know a fine pic and when
I did watch those movies like later on I
was older a little bit older and I just
get this sense of dread awful this
afterwards why I'd watch that oh yeah
yeah that's a that's a that's a
depressing movie like like Jason you
just leave Camp Crystal Lake and you
don't look back
Jason's very easy to avoid the zombies
who are everywhere and they're never
going to leave your front door so they
get in that's horrifying mm-hmm
absolutely horrifying
I'm with you I am with you rich I also
have no idea where I'm supposed to go I
have no idea where I'm supposed to go
melee combat and Terra zombies a part
that there are millions of them billions
by the time it gets out of control
you're fucked oh yeah this that's the
greatest part of any zombie movie or TV
show there's no winning right that's the
whole point of a zombie movie is the
slow realization that even if you can
hold them off for a little bit in means
shit Jason can follow you to New York
then you get on a plane and you go to
Bangladesh and then by the time Jason
walks to the other side of the earth you
know walking down the ocean through the
trenches and gets there then you just
fly back to New York you can give Jason
the runaround for quite some time
oh listen if you're working with the
proper authorities you can put Jason in
a strong-enough box to contain him
and walking walking through populated
areas Jason's gonna catch the notice of
some kind of government agency sooner or
later first the police and then once
they realize they have something
supernatural on their hands the
government is gonna get involved
somebody is going to to shove Jason in a
containment cell yep and start probing
him with needles are you kidding they're
gonna Hulk bomb them they're gonna gamma
bomb them and what they're gonna do is
they're gonna they're gonna show them
pictures of like terrorists having
unprotected premarital sex and drop them
into war zones look see these terrorists
yeah they're smoking pot Jason go take
care of them shoot her into space what
for those who don't know a running
storyline in the Hulk books was that the
government used Bruce Banner as
something they called a gamma bomb which
what they would do is just say it was it
was in a book called just called Hulk oh
so it was one like special thing yeah it
was one special it was it was actually a
really good series and it was just
called Hulk I think and it was it was
just Bruce Banner being incredibly
depressed and we found out why is
because what they would do the
government would take Bruce Banner the
human throw him out of a plane without a
parachute over a war zone so that he
would Hulk up from stress alone destroy
the area and then as soon as he passed
out they'd scoop him up again and then
would you use him as something they
called the gamma bomb it was a really
good story
very good story what brick says hey guys
love the stream did you guys ever see or
care about for half-life 2 episode 3
plot leak
are you upset at valve for never
finishing the series and leaving it on a
cliffhanger
I was always upsetting when something
story based gets left in a cliffhanger
I've not heard anything about any leaks
though the so basically valve has
admitted that they've admit it's dead
and why there's the question why cuz
there aren't they're on to other things
now they there's bigger moneymakers then
game you think just for just from people
having good faith in the company they
would they would at least slap it
together they have dota 2 and steam and
counter-strike and everything else they
do they've no they died said basically
they basically admitted they did not
admit anything official yeah but after a
slew of non announcements one of the
writers leaked what the script was going
to be yeah and that was basically what
I'm saying it's never gonna happen
here's the script yeah and you know
really the thing I'm most upset about is
this whole gaming in episodes thing was
their idea to prove that you can make
games shorter and therefore faster and
they have disproved their own theory
which I guess is fine right it's check I
know valve makes their money as a
distribution platform I do you think I'm
stupid yeah I get that you they seem
like they seem like cool dudes yeah you
know Gabe knew all he seems like a cool
dude you think that farmed out to
somebody else they could have had that
completed of course
and that's why Gabe and the people I
found are such cool dudes yeah cuz they
won't put it out until it meets their
standards and it doesn't and it probably
never will for the record this is why I
avoid serialized content until it's
finished because it frequently never
gets finished
yeah I have people ask me have you seen
lost and I say no is lost done yes did
it was it good all said no no okay well
that's debatable there's some bad
seasons I think some of its worth it you
must sound a lot of good things that way
like Firefly I also avoid a shitload a
heartbreak I can't stand unfinished
stories hated hated gotcha Firefly man
it's gotta watch it gotta watch it I'm a
beefcake you heard this I I'm not bored
with this game I don't know where to go
I'm lost in the game and thus I was
because I am enjoying the game I really
like this kind of puzzle platformer and
I cannot for the life of me figure out
where to go
rich is scared to fall in love rich rich
is too smart to let himself fall in love
easily and for bad reasons
rich doesn't buy into that it's it's not
the destination it's the journey
bullshit yeah but then you're not gonna
go anywhere boom that's what I had you
don't go anywhere if there's no
destination then you're just going in
circles or you fall off a cliff because
there isn't a proper destination we're
talking about half-life 3 being
unfinished there's there specifically no
destination there Jack yeah but then you
won't go anywhere cuz you because you
don't care about the journey
unless III wait and is it done oh it's
done okay then I can get my fucking
hopes up sometimes very shy sometimes
the journeys worth it rich sometimes
I get figured out what I have to do
yes bainfield death the road needs to
lead somewhere sometimes the road leads
to the road man the road leads to the
road then why are you wanted cuz it
maybe it's a pretty Road I don't know
lots of reasons
you know I hop hard and says hey fellas
Jack yeah have you ever had your kids
play older system games I work with
at-risk kids and boite and brought them
mine s today one could get past level 1
in Mario 3 and all lost - gasps glass
Joe and punch-out
ha ha really how old though cuz when I
was like hole drivin 7-6
I lost a glass Joe sure and punch out
sure yeah yeah we have some older
consoles that they like playing we have
a Super Nintendo that they love to play
when you're was push him 88 87 988 that
was way too late
86 85
well Eclipse is still a great show
despite not having an ending
yeah it's disappointing that it doesn't
have an ending though I don't like that
besides Metalocalypse was always a a a
sweetly situational comedy thing they
kind of had some kind of story thing
going on in the background but that
story thing was itself largely a joke
right it's Assyria like like you're not
disappointed that you never got a
conclusion from Columbo all right you
don't need yet Metalocalypse was a show
you don't really need a story wrap up
for I mean I would like to have one
honestly but for the long-running story
teases they felt more like jokes than an
actual thing that meant something right
I feel like I know what I have to do
here but also that I don't you can break
these rocks if you run into them fast
enough and so I what I'm trying to do is
go off the jump and then fling myself
around the corner hard enough to break
these rocks just so people understand
what it is I'm trying to do why are
people so have such a hard-on to
convince me I need to accept their it's
the journey not the destination bullshit
I'm not telling them not to enjoy what
they want to enjoy we're talking about
what I like in my fiction oh sure sure
well you know because one because it
goes on to bigger themes than just the
things you enjoy in your fiction it's
that's that's uh that's life advice and
they just want to make sure rich that
you are reaching your full court and
talking about fictional stories not life
we're talking about life life always has
a shitty ending it doesn't matter what
you do life and shitty well doesn't have
to I mean we're talking about fiction
life doesn't have to end shit
you die but maybe you're okay with that
you need to play half-life rich I'll
tell you what I will play the entire
half-life series once half-life 3 comes
out have you ever loved once they finish
episode 3 I'm down
have you played any half-life I haven't
ok I missed it when it first came out
for whatever reason I forgot what it was
I think you talked to me about that
where it was just like your computer
wasn't perfect I thought about it the
sense I was thinking it was quick what
Arab but half-life 2 I think that I'm
not half like half-life 1 that was that
came out after quite - and I know I had
a decent at least a halfway decent BC
when quake 2 came out so I probably
could have run it ok for whatever reason
it just it passed me by hmm
I was much younger back then and a $50
purchase for a game was a bigger deal
sure sure
I can see that
what half-life now when half-life 2 came
out very specifically I did not like the
DRM I I still bitch about Steam and it
basically being DRM and I I did not want
to play half-life 2 because I I couldn't
own it
you still can't oh sure now you you you
can't game these days without just
dealing with this fact that you don't
actually own any of the games that you
buy right but back in the day you were
making a mindful protest this is why I
support gog.com hmm good ol games they
still games digitally that our DRM free
please if you're gonna buy something and
it's available on Steam and GOG buy the
GOG version also itch it's done I owe it
H dot IO they they specialize in indie
games you know something of this ilk but
they also will sell you in DRM free cups
if that is what you are interested in
you know I tried to buy this game on it
first but then I forgot some passwords
and it was a hassle so I just bought on
Steam and said yeah it's way easier you
could buy half-life 2 on the orange box
for the Xbox 360 and Oded yeah but I'm
not playing the first-person shooter
with a fucking gamepad oh yeah right
come on get together that's that's just
not happening that's how I played
half-life 2 that would that would that
would prevent me from enjoying the
experience making it a moot point that
was my first experience with half-life 2
and Team Fortress 2 so many hours in
both on my 360
Zach of the axis says if Mike wants a
serious men and black story he'd love
the SCP foundation thousands of articles
about containing the paranormal with
hundreds of authors including Internet
darling max landis and me Oh usually
don't tell Mike what to read his free
time but I've read some of the SCP some
of them really neat lots of them are bad
but that's the nature of like a crowd
written fictional universe sure you know
speaking max landis he said max landis
right yeah okay yeah speaking of mr. max
landis I finally saw something that max
wrote yeah I probably talked about this
before a couple times I have never seen
any one of Max's movies and sometimes I
feel bad about that because you know he
came here to hang out with us for a bit
and but I finally watched Dirk Gently
and yeah and you know what the pilot is
pretty bad yeah but it gets better okay
and I'd say it's pretty darn good all
right the the one big problem yep -
there's two big problem yeah they want
the guy who plays Dirk I is a little
annoying okay which I think they're
trying to do purposefully because Dirk
you know Dirk Gently in the books at
least is annoying and so he's playing
he's playing him up to max from what
I've been able to gather is really bad
at writing dialogue here every character
especially in the pilot if you watch the
pilot every character talks exactly like
max landis and it's really upsetting
because like an old cop talks like max
landis and Dirk Gently does and Elijah
Wood and a young hip black lady they all
talk like max landis and it gets a
little much because max is a verbose
fellow but as the as the series goes on
all the care like I think more the
actors kind of find their base yeah and
actually tone down
some of Max's dialogue a little bit and
I think it's actually pretty good it's a
good like his stories are neat what's
happening in the show is actually
actually pretty compelling okay I
haven't seen it I cannot come at him
don't mean to be like oh I just haven't
seen him oh yeah no and it's it's just
it's the first thing of Max's that I've
ever watched it was like oh you know
what not not as bad as I was expecting
no offense oh wow max but backhanded
backhanded so backhand you know I was I
was really worried after the pilot Max's
dad made Blues Brothers
mm well look he also made Blues Brothers
1980 so it kind of balances out he also
made clue well now will be produced I
think clue he didn't directed he also
made some classic comedy like he made
coming to America right coming to
America thriller did so did he also do a
trading place America
yeah Merc immoral from London yeah he's
done a thousand good film was the fuck
cares he did Blues Brothers 2000 right
he's made up for it blow people might be
assholes they want to be assholes stop
being an asshole he made up for it you
know with all the other great movies he
made also that's his dad not him we
mentioned for the third that you need
you need to clean out your ears son
that's literally what we were talking
about is it I have the things who stand
it why can't I
rich that was your joke Oh almost me
being an asshole
oh wait that wasn't even my joke I think
that was somebody else had that line and
I just said it Blues Brothers 2000 for
the the best of the worst with him
I very much don't remember rich I know I
mean I said it wasn't my idea one of one
of Max's joke that he kept on repeating
was like just giving his dad credit for
a bunch of films that he didn't make my
dad directed home long right right oh
but here's the thing about Dirk Gently
good show overall the main bad guy for
Dirk Gently talks exactly like mr.
blinken exactly can you just hire Mike
and here's the thing there was a little
behind the scenes where he was talking
about the voice max took credit for the
voice he was talking to the interview
lady and he goes the the voice that he's
doing is actually just a voice that I
would do to him I would tell him that
voice and I would just talk to him in
that voice all the time and to make sure
you know like so like he's just doing an
impression of me doing the voice he did
not give proper credit just putting that
out there at least in the one thing that
I saw him talk about the voice and he
did not put out proper proper credit and
it is clearly plankin clearly almost to
the point where it's distracting
watching because it's clearly blanket
we're talking about Dirk gently's
holistic detective agency on BBC America
written and produced by max landis pause
and read some more names sure let me
just get through this area
there we go um YouTube it's not YouTube
dramas Hollywood drama he's Hollywood
now but overall it's a very good show I
recommend it if you're like if you're
into kind of the more the they're like
this fantasy sci-fi like a doctor who is
it's it's really enjoyable it's fun
it's like hipster Doctor Who that might
not be a selling point for anyone no
that's uh it's probably not a selling
point turn dozens of people off sorry
series Wow shit good night Trevor okay
I'm gonna catch up and reading uh
subscriber names yeah okay yeah we're
gonna read some uh subscriber names here
like head we're not done for the night
we're doing so we're shaking it up a
little bit
we're interspersing the names throughout
rather than having a a 60 Minutes
segment at the end of our stream where
we read names right
humberto Cabbage Patch 432 fucking
months in a row says love the new emotes
are they rich have you seen the new
emotes I see some of them they're using
them we made it I made them I made a mad
strats and then a bush and a trap yeah
we could have mad Bush are they separate
ones no not a conjoined because at first
we had the conjoined one just mad trap
strats i had up i think i saw these and
i had an issue with the mad which way is
the mad slanted alright mad is slanted
on this angle mad needs to be slanted on
this angle like a tramp bad strap but
it's not just it's not just mad trap
strats because it's also my mad bush
trap i understand that but when it is
men strapped strats it should be slit I
also I wanted to make it I wanted to
make it enough so you could do like mad
tums
strats boom and have tums in there too
because I made the tongue well sure but
I'm alright I want it to make it so you
could put anything in between the mad
strats right yep chat what is your
opinion on the mats lint no Ridge that's
stupid
damn Wow first of all settle down
thought it'd be neat if we were like a
trap mad Tim strats right mad clown
strats like my the only problem with
strats is a little bit longer word than
mad so you can read mad really easily
but stratts is a little harder to read I
was trying to find that right balance
yeah
but hey I'm glad you guys appreciate it
I got my I got work tums that was the
most requested requested one we got we
got the bushes we got the trap we got
the mad we got the strats one of the
tums look like I've not seen it tongues
yet here was somebody hey everybody
let's have a tums festival okay Tom's
festival now oh I see it
okay I thought that was like an energy
drink or some kind of can dumbest
festival okay I could see it now yeah
all right glad you love the new remote

that Kelsey Grammer that one of the
nineties military life comedies like
sergeant bilko and most one would Bruce
Campbell McHale's Navy emails down

possibly Rob Schneider but you know what
you could say that about any one of
those movies I like sergeant bilko well
Steve Martin yeah so you know something

yeah now that says what's your opinion
on using a time machine to visit
dinosaurs huge mistake that sounds like
a butterfly effect nightmare just
breathing the air would would have major
disruptions on the flow of time as we
know it and suddenly Homo sapiens didn't
even evolve oh yeah it could be a nasty
nasty flaw just just by disrupting the
air patterns
oh are you kidding like we're so full of
germs that they're not used to like if
if we sweat not even that Jack not even
that we're talking about hundreds of
millions yeah hundred sixty-five what
was what was the asteroid that's a long
time for a butterfly effect to get
completely and utterly out of control
absolute absolutely when when you land
you're going to step on something that
was a great great great great great
ancestor of ours and completely fuck us
haven't you seen that Simpsons episode
okay Jay fresh juices hey Jack
hi just letting you know that million
made a Friday 13th inspired comic in the
bloodshot comic universe a bloodshot Tex
up test subject limited Silver Lake and
was believed to be a serial killer
I know you can hear your that bloodshot
cosplayer and I know you love bloodshot
I like a lot of what valiant does but I
just don't I don't have it in me to care
about bloodshot
and I'm very sorry
you would have trouble breathing back
then there's more co2 you would need to
be wearing some sort of environmental
suit then you're still gonna cause a
massive butterfly effect just setting
foot on the ground
no you guys you do not take that risk
it's insane it's insane all right
Renaissance caveman says one of my
all-time favorites was a sci-fi western
hybrid canceled by Fox far too early
don't know if I've ever heard you talk
about it any thoughts on The Adventures
of Brisco County jr. I haven't I haven't
seen it
honestly I might enjoy it I know but
Bruce Campbell adventure comedy oh I've
seen that you know I think I'll watch
the pilot and I wasn't in love I didn't
hate it okay no boy
here's cowboy yeah he's like one of the
episodes I saw like he made a joke about
getting food while still on his horse
and he called it a drive-thru window I
was like how Hardin says hey rich the
ones who sucked at punch-out or teens oh
my god
also I know it's late but you and you
alone have me hyped for the Han Solo
movie I'm making a bingo card with your
predictions Disney owes you you're
welcome
I can't see a teenager even if they've
never seen an NES before not beating
glass Joe different time and it's a
different time have they played any game
before didn't I say who their special
needs kids well then that's different he
might have been he might have said then
there was something about the kids he
was launching named three videos on the
shelf in the background like without
looking a ninja hunt twin dragon
encounter karate Cup what
Oh everyone invited name three of them
without looking and I don't I don't know
that I can yeah a bloodsport
I don't know if that's actually on the
shelf and now we have in bloodsport
what's that what's that treasure one I
see all the times a big fat box
something treasure hunters but I don't
remember the name oh god damn it
you think I think I could just find just
three Jack just three rich you could you
could put two random words together that
have to do with ninjas and killing
that's not that's a big fat lie
you could it would be a big fat fucking
lie and I would be a fraud no do it put
two more together that would be like the
Pascal's wager Jack it would be that
belies death ninja I bet we have
something called death ninja deadly
assassin ninja assassin
silent killer
Chad O'Brien's probably on there
somewhere silent killers right there
rich and I just made that up
I just made that up kill ninja I'm sure
cyborg samurai guys got to be on there
others on that shelf so probably no more
baths is on that shelf
oh the sex 10 here I know you know what
I know what I know something that's on
that shelf huh
only because I was looking at it earlier
when we were doing the episode yeah is
uh is Lady dragon with Cynthia Rothrock
yeah yeah lady dragon might be lady
dragon to space cop isn't on that show
space cop wouldn't be on that shelf
those are best of the worst movies on
that shelf space cops too good for that
shit unwashed
have you seen this
what she looks like death
she she quite honestly looks like she's
in her 70s Mae West in presumably her
70s
starring in a romantic comedy opposite
look who's in that know next to him I'm
pretty sure that is a young Timothy
Dalton oh my god 70 year old Mae West I
an see I thought you were pointing to
Dum Dums I thought she was opposite Dom
DeLuise which that is Dom DeLuise you
are absolutely right that is Timothy
Dalton and and and a corpse of Mae West
tilted a more the other yeah no no get a
closer range of so no yeah yeah
there we go there we go look at how
amazing that was it's really difficult
to find your way around this game I mean
everyone know that yep
Dargis says evening rich and Jack gaming
journalists are complaining about the
difficulty of games critical question as
game reviewers should game journalists
only focus on games they are good at or
get good I think it's a game reviewer
you express your opinion on the game
yeah it has nothing to do with whether
or not you're good at a game if it's not
a genre you like as long as you give
your reasons for why you don't like it
yeah I think it's fine this it's like
any other criticism if you are a food
critic who is well known to not like
seafood then you just know not to trust
their opinions on a seafood dish it's
it's any other criticism I don't know
why people people often get get this
shit up in their craw about about game
journalists and it's just like settle
down as far as game is being I like
difficult look a game reviewer
specifically might not like a difficult
game because it's his job to review the
fucking game and he wants to finish the
game so he can write the review and
40-hour a 40-hour game for a game
reviewer the game journalist might be
for at 40 hours that he has to put up
with rather than 40 hours that he's
enjoying sure
I will flat up admit when we when I
haven't finished a game or we haven't
finished a game of course and if I
didn't finish the game because I didn't
want to there was there was probably a
reason for it right well that just means
like yeah you know I wasn't that into it
sometimes no no no everyone's everyone's
been up on that like have you seen the
cuphead tutorial thing going around the
internet yep
everybody's been up on that guy and you
know most of us figured it out before he
did that being said I've been reading
some really good threads on from a game
developers perspective yeah and I'm
saying like how difficult it is to write
that tutorial stage because for you as
the developer you've been playing the
game for months yeah yeah and then
usually you wait till the end to write
this is third stage and they and
actually the consensus among game
developers whom I follow was that it was
a poorly designed tutorial stage for
which game which I run I love cuphead
come okay have you seen it when playing
I wish no no have you seen that have you
seen the viral clip of the game's
journalist not being able to get past
the tutorial stage you know oh that's
what's that's I'm sure what that's going
what that comment is about so it's this
clip of a journalist not knowing how to
jump and dash to get over a thing yeah
even though it said so it gives a little
thing that says you know press a to jump
and you jump over a thing right and then
the next one is an even taller thing and
it just says - so the journalist tries
to like - tries to jump - even though
what you actually have to do is get on
the original thing you jumped over jump
and - to get off the high higher one it
you'll figure it out right away the the
moral of story is could have been an off
day for the games journalist it was a
poorly designed tutorial level someone
in the chat LinkedIn it I
know why anybody would trust game
journalist in this day and age I really
don't what I mean I mean what's win that
remember the the doom thing where the
gameplay footage they could barely play
Doom no I don't know there's this
footage of a game dev who was just
terrible at that a dev I mean I'm a
journalist like terrible at doing oh
yeah yeah no I know first of all I don't
remember that so these are people who
are dependent upon these people who made
games to get early copies how can you
trust what they say Jack I don't you you
you you need EA support to keep going
like how do you how do you trust that
person's opinion when he reviews in the
a game that's a look that's the craziest
thing about about this to me it's like I
never had like you know like I'll shit
I'll watch reviews and enjoy them but
like I would never take someone's word
for like you know like it's just it's
just the entertainment it's just like
talking about a game I I will trust any
random normal person their opinion on it
on a game sure before I will trust an
IGN review haha yes yeah well you get to
know someone and you get to know their
tastes and you say oh you know what our
tastes line up a lot I'll listen to that
person like I was like remember I four
exes they offered us was at Alpha
Centauri
I didn't we didn't do it cuz I was I was
uncomfortable with the concept they
wanted to give us an early copy of Alpha
Centauri not office isn't that what was
the one they did the space one space one
space civilization
yeah yeah well because they were afraid
they were just fans and they're like hey
are you games he was just a fan I wanna
do something nice but like
can't do a review on a game you get me
right I can't do that right that well
that that opens that opens a lot of
floodgates remember remember with the
thing you're talking about basically a
seven like shit like that
yes yeah that's basically a seven that's
that that video is so poignant about
like well you don't remember who the
person and the person is that we should
plug that video
sure yeah stir just a youtuber named
star yeah I want to say it's star
underscore did a video called basically
a seven and it was the the crux of the
video was about this is old Jackie Chan
like PlayStation 1 game yeah that got a
seven any place there anybody talks
about like all the games that get a
seven and like how you can take that and
extrapolate it to when you don't want to
be really mean to a game because you
have to keep a good relationship with
the people who make the games
explicitly tell them you're almost
guaranteed to rip the game apart
beforehand then say whatever you want
all right we are human beings though and
I know despite the fact that I seem like
I could be a huge asshole right yeah
the minute the fan of ours from Firaxis
starts giving us free games I'm gonna
feel good if we want to turn one of
those games apart I'm gonna at that
point I'm going to feel bad and that
that will affect the review that will
affect what I have to say about the game
yeah business and friends don't mix it's
it's a bitch I just think it's a bad
idea mm-hmm
which is why rich works for Mike look it
can be potentially awkward yeah
absolutely absolutely like that's a
that's a minefield conceivably there'll
be a time a few years from now I'll be
looking back and be saying that was a
huge mistake maybe maybe there's always
a risk when you when you mix like when
you make and it's not just friends
family to like if you mix business with
friends or family there is always a
chance that something will go horribly
horribly wrong yes so basically I I have
a hard time trusting any kind of
large-scale gaming reviews opinion
as you should rich as your mother
fucking shit fuck I'm with you I'm with
a hundred percent evil Lord David says
hey guys David here when prereq gets too
many subscribers yeah I suggest drawing
names out of a box and stoning one of us
to death each each month to cut down on
reading time
jaqen uses firecrackers look I'm I'm not
complaining nothin number of subscribers
I'm just I'm just saying if this is
maybe a better way to read names
absolutely like we should always that
was an awesome little swingin levels
that's what that's what I wanted we're
always looking for ways to improve the
product for you find folks and sometimes
it's as easy as a nice new camera
sometimes it's something that we need to
work at like a nice new camera that
doesn't work I mean I ideally perfect
world you're reading them as they come
up the names but the problem with that
is a lot of times we'll be in the middle
of a conversation about something like
worth like trusting a games yo gate
trusting games journalism yeah and then
we got you know yeah I got to stop the
conversation to read the name and I
don't like interrupting the flow of the
conversation to read names which is why
we started stockpiling them and reading
them at the end now as well see chunks
chunks here and there we'll see how that
works maybe we should set like a timer
like a stand-up time just like a set-up
time right like 30 minutes every 30
minutes will read like ten ten or five
or whatever it is
get it get it get that that mochi b85
says hi Wreckers hello mochi i am so
hyped for more X common I asked a favor
can you name another soldier and war of
the chosen mochi I'd understand if you
don't to give others a chance to kick
alien butt stew let's see we will see we
will see was mochi on your on your super
awesome squad he was he was on the squad
I need to finish that playthrough do you
want to finish it before number two I
wasn't anticipated that I wasn't
anticipating XCOM 2 DLC to be coming out
for all I knew they were done I guess I
shouldn't be shocked they didn't do
anything within I has a big expansion
like later down the road I shouldn't be
shocked I should have anticipated that
yeah yeah shit I think small
interruptions or a big load at the end
is better than big chunk interruptions
mMmmm maybe maybe this isn't working
it's an experiment it's an experiment
word that it's perfectly you know it's
experiments can fail sometimes yes like
half-life episode 3 that's what we've
learned that wasn't that wasn't like a
failed experiment that was just like a
failed experiment failed experiment
because they they found that doing games
in episodes wasn't as profitable as
running at the other business
the experiment was dota 2 makes us more
money
anonymous anonymous I'm willing to bet
that the last Jedi will be Empire as you
predicted but just done bigger and with
more explosions advertising keeps
implying that with all the overly
oversized ships and vehicles where where
is that where is that major trailer
where's it at it's coming out in
December where is that you know Empire
had the big battle in the beginning it
was just one big battle Empire had more
than that though like they had a big
that wasn't a big battle that was
something you could cut into the trailer
sure sure they had enough small shit to
cut into the trailer I there they're
just they're waiting on something I'm
sure I think it's weird that we haven't
seen the second trailer that more hasn't
come out yet I think it's weird what do
I know Jack I am frequently wrong
despite the joke that rich is always
right which I love that joke because the
joke is richest always right but I am
frequently wrong but let's keep doing
that joke that's a good joke that we
should keep doing even though it's not
it's gonna be true it was a good joke I
think you know they're just waiting
there they're waiting on they're waiting
because it doesn't matter when they have
the trailer people will go see it no
matter what
whoa
hello creepy bunker I hope episode eight
isn't like Empire cuz it's so boring
says 11th century folklore obvious troll
is obvious yeah troll it's just that's
just a joke sure except there now
rehashing that - there is a gorilla
walker so there are definitely the
hashing Empire which is not a good sign
look if road one didn't make it obvious
there's gonna be a walker in every movie
they do now there's gonna be one on the
Han Solo movie like a proto walker it's
gonna be well let me just be the Walker
from Empire stuff said it's not that
much longer but I suppose you're right
well there wasn't a dat Return of the
Jedi it doesn't do much just sitting
there outside of the the base on Endor
and you don't see it at the end battle
for whatever reason but it's there is it
yeah I'm pretty sure there's a walker on
it well there's no no a big one oh yeah
I think in this I think you see it in
the scene where Luke turns himself in I
suppose you know that those wouldn't be
good for maneuvering around the forest
yeah it's just not what's already in the
forest though cuz it's on Endor it's
just not it's just not there in the
final battle of course
didn't the ewoks going it that was the
two legged one the 80s I'm talking about
the at-at the big one the four-legged
one there's one on Endor what do they
stand for again like armored transport
and all-terrain armored transport thing
like that yeah why do you call them at
because it's called a DAT
what else you're gonna call them 8080
I've always called them a t-80s
Oh at-at Walker I'm just I'm just
letting you call them what did I say in
Empire how do they refer to them on
screen they call them 8080
I think they just call them walkers yeah
that's a good question though I believe
like because I think the only time they
ever refer to them is you know during
the during the Hoth battle and they just
say Imperial walkers huh I call them
like Jeff yeah I've always called them
1880s and 80s teas but they call them a
beer my dad's got a better flow to it I
disagree I think a tad sounds like a cat
hacking up a hairball
yeah to know that yeah and then what'd
he say for the other one that's at 80 18
George Lucas refers to them as a dance
Danny also calls Luke Skywalker Luke so
you might want to start calling them
lock okay Luke I like hey Luke a ski
walk here because you wouldn't want to
say it like George Lucas says it my name
is Lucas Keller on Java video I come
from the planet and are
but googas is funny but I think I think
we're being a bit weird saying I'm wrong
just because George Lucas says it that
way right I'm which you're rich
shag ohad 1897 says I forgot to ask ya
is the space cop footage with the
African dudes real or is it fake thanks
again
prepare for shaman shall mein know
Samhain I'm reading that better now
Samhain Halloween no that's the work I
like Hollywood there they're famous they
they was into that action movie right or
number right
yeah well hello wakka wakka Wally would
write something like that no they they
are internet famous they are a group of
African filmmakers who work with a
budget of less than zero dollars because
they live in Africa yeah and so make
Gandhi action movies yeah and you know
they use toy helicopters but film them
in such a way that they kind of look
like real helicopters but not really and
they're great and apparently they've
seen someone sent them a copy of space
cop and they watched it and loved it
it's crazy
no so that's real and then they were
they were coming to a film festival in
Madison ways the story behind that I
don't know the story behind that I'm
telling you this oh oh yeah they were
coming to a film festival in Madison
because you know their story gets told
and now they're they're using like the
sales of their movies and like I think
like there's a documentary guy with them
that kind of like relays all their
information and they're using that to
create like youth centers in their area
and like give kids access to more
technology you know set kids up which is
amazing
so they got invited to a film festival
in Madison and that was their promo for
it was the only two things in Wisconsin
and the snow and space gap so yeah they
loved space cop they loved space cop but
uh space got visit the kid oh man if
rich went to Africa as space cops he
could start you could star in the next
walk out walk out Wally would film as
space cop the kids
would love it rich we can make that
happen do you want that to happen I
don't want to get out of plane jack
that's true you don't get on a plane to
go to California and visit spend months
away from home Oh a week what am I gonna
do away from my desk look like a pewter
round Jack we could we could go to
Africa for a week it's gorgeous in
Africa rich we would have so much fun
you want you will do it I'm making it
I'm gonna make it happen
absolutely you just need a cameo to
create the space cop Cinematic Universe
absolutely it's rich afraid of flying
yes every time I get in one of those
goddamn planes I have visions of being
on the news floating foot they found and
it's Lebanese foot fun floating an ocean
and sneaker still yeah I mean out of all
the family remains located out of all of
the things to worry about that is that
should be the very low on your list
airplanes are very safe statistically
they're safe within cars just the foot
yeah there's a story what specifically
that that's a reference to I that there
was some kind of crash were recovered
someone's foot that was what they found
yeah I agree I think that is an
irrational fear of riches flying is a
perfectly safe way to travel I don't I
don't think that one just crashed though
I believe that was some kind of Cold War
incident where I actually got shot down
oh okay yeah yeah straight into like
Russian airspace you want Africa we you
know we crossed the other ocean so we
won't be going anywhere near North Korea
so we'll be fine it's the Lockerbie
bombing it could have been that one
we'll be fine
rabbit's feet our good luck yeah so rich
if you lost your foot just keep it up a
rabbit just keep it around your neck
though then it'll be good luck all right
how hard it says what's gonna you done
yeah okay I've Hardin says the teens
weren't special needs just at risk
oh sorry more behavior oh they kicked my
ass every day in Madden and Call of Duty
they play platformers - but are terrible
at older games today was satisfying so
weird many apologies
we're coming from special needs then
that is so utterly weird I here's what I
bet I bet if they like took a couple
days they could they could learn it but
they're just not they're not used to
that they're used to something else you
know it's very simple but they need to
learn it that's all that's a whole
different wavelength they need to be on
I I never went to the doctor about it
but I'm pretty sure I broke my toe the
night I finally beat Mike Tyson okay
it's like I'm in the middle of this I'm
an adult at this point this is like this
is like less than 10 years ago okay nice
and I am busting my ass off trying to
beat Tyson sure and I'm in the middle of
a match with Tyson I'm doing pretty well
I'm doing well I think I might I think I
might do it I think I might do it and
then there's I'm trying to remember
because it's been a while since I played
the the original punch-out I was in a
situation where I could not pause the
game and and Caren had a friend show up
and they're knocking on the door they
want to get in I can't stop playing Mike
Tyson's punch-out and they're not gonna
the door trying to get in and I'm five
doll I'm fling butch oh you guys don't
understand I'm fighting Mike fucking
Tyson and so like between rounds I was
like I got a second I can put the
controller down i put the controller
down i sprint to the door open the door
and I fucking stub my toe big time
I hurt like a fucking bitch let them in
is to the facts of the game played in
the pain and I don't I don't remember
who's on I don't know that it probably
wasn't that specific fight with Tyson
but I did beat him that night yeah he's
very proud of it
nice my toe hurt for a while I'm pretty
sure I broke my little toe well the
thing with that is even if you went to
the doctor they you can't do anything to
set it total right yeah that's so funny
like toy respect tear right listen I'm
surprised rich got him a dogs wait
outside
wait outside counter band probably not
uh unless vampires kind of special Oh
for what about what about I just
wondering if we were doing any more
videos about the director of the last
vampire right now he starts to make
movies that are like controversial for
controversial sake yeah and we might
want to sidestep that and nothing like
we've seen a couple more of his movies
and nothing quite hits that last vampire
vibe like that that what's the same mark
Castro movie he started making but stop
because obviously his video was
corrupted and he tried to pass it off as
a short film with a stylized touch to it
yes mark Kerr I think it was the name is
Mark asteroid I'm not getting it wrong
the guy who kidnapped those very real
women and held them at his basement flag
over a decade yeah he were socks you
made a movie about a short film about
shortly after the fact tennis coming
kind of scuzzy yeah that's not as it's
on his YouTube channel hmm and it's
obvious that it was intended to be a
longer film but he stopped making it
once he realized some of his footage was
corrupted cuz there was some weird
there's some weird artifacts and
glitches going on yeah also did one
about the killing spree in Norway like
really soon after it happened and so
yeah he he went from like kind of
laughably bad filmmaker to kind of
scummy bad filmmakers oh yeah probably
not gonna touch any more of his stuff
alright um grogger 88 says there's five
dollars for hopes that you stream
darkest dungeon someday have have either
of you tried it well we were rich
streamed in a while ago and I've played
a bunch of it actually really liked it
sometime they wanna see it I'm done with
it now only playing and I could play it
again I enjoy darkest dungeon I thought
it was a I thought it was a really neat
game my only my only real problem with
it was was a group management became
more than 50% of the game you know
because you manage your team and then
you go out and you know explore the
dungeon right and managing your team and
upgrades and you know who's in the crazy
house and who's in the brothel and who's
in the bar and who's doing what became
such a large part of the game that I
would spend a good half-hour like it
that would be my bathroom yeah and not I
would like I would spend a half hour in
the bathroom but I would spend a half
hour just getting ready to go to the
dungeon but then I'd have to put my game
down so then I do you know I put it down
and I'd pick it up later and I wouldn't
remember what I did with my crew yeah
and so I was using it as a mobile game I
had it on my Vita and after a while it
just it just became a little
overwhelming but I enjoyed it okay I
enjoyed it darkest empty and you
streamed it a bit yeah once yeah god I
so celina Ness Salinas Salinas sure CEO
am en es s sure says I'm talking about
darkest dungeon and commit sin you know
what those Star Wars hacks haven't
thought of yet forget about Imperial
walkers it's time for the Imperial
runners and that's that's that's it
that's how we're ending this with with
that
right you think you can hear my foot
hold on wait I think I can do it my foot
no why is it on the table no you go
the whole point is so we can do this no
without you have to hey I didn't hit the
mute button did you know I know I undid
it damn didn't back me let me try it
alright alright wait is it in this menu
are we no no no that's the wrong thing
wrong menu just get up and do it
goodbye everybody
