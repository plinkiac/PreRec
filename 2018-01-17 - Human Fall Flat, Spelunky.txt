[Part I]
you've done it all rich so how you doing
hey everybody what's what's going on
what's going on oh yeah it's cold as
fuck out and that's the nature of
January it's true the worst month
sometimes followed by February followed
by March you know it happens is where
we're here that's all that matters
I just made you watch the Nintendo la
Bowl yeah motion controls the cardboard
I don't I don't get it to me it's very
clearly how do we make peripheral so
cheap that everyone will buy them do I
really need the cardboard to just do
this I think you do I think you do for
something I think for a lot of it
they're actually like this is this was
their idea to implement because like
they have like IR controllers in their
joy comm yeah and so like this is the
way they ain't they will implement it
like don't they already have fishing
motion control games that don't require
a cardboard stick yeah but you know you
could have the cardboard thing ha you
say cheap $70 is not cheap well you know
for the game I how much the game is
gonna be probably sixty seven dollars
but then everything that goes with it
you know to buy an extra cardboard thing
I just don't get it
it looks adorable it looks adorable I
probably here's the thing I probably
won't get it unless we're gonna fuck
around with it on streem like I won't
play it or like your kids huh for your
kids they never play the swish yeah you
know they only care about iPad
really yeah they really they only care
about iPad news and like I have stuff
for them like they did go they just go
on a pretty sizable Mario Kart kick is
that just a condemnation of the types of
console games you get these days no I
don't think so I just think it's a it's
an it's a condemnation of iPad games I
think they're I think too many console
games are reared for long plays for
adult audiences for like the real gamer
and this is that their mistake they have
not fostered a new generation i but the
new generation doesn't care cuz they
they have iPad games they can just touch
because they never got a console game
that looks interesting to them that's
right but I mean that they're also
pretty young so we'll wait we'll wait to
see what happens my nephew has an Xbox
one and he plays only on his tablet and
says hello dunno yeah yeah
it's dead Jim what's the gaming it's
dead Jim it's dead I know with that
gaming is that where it's more alive
than ever
I'll be doing split-screen or you just
want me to get you want me to go for a
little yeah I guess we both go in first
I am alright full disclosure I am not at
all excited for this what are you doing
I don't know what I'm doing I'm trying
to start
okay let's green split screen I'm
holding the trigger press the trigger
sure we start is that okay okay you're
not at all excited about this game which
is very I mean I offered I said hey you
know I've gotten a ton of requests for
us to play this game uh-huh
and it was it was part of a weirdo games
bundle so I got it for fairly cheap and
and I was like yeah you know it could be
it could be a silly could be a silly
game to play but you know of course I
said it but of course I said if you had
any other suggestions feel free to it's
awesome
it was like Octodad kind of thing I
can't he won't get back up
well what what what did you do
I wanted to okay now hold on
hold on I want to just I wanted to see
if I can
okay
use lovesick sigh I appear to be on the
right for anybody who wants to keep
track have a control just grab an
instructional video hold it tight great
whenever you're lost or otherwise in
despair look around for such remotes
once activated they'll provide
instructions ranging from very helpful
to totally useless if there is no remote
around you you may return to initial
despair or you may start looking for
what's important okay yeah humans they
will run into every door they encounter
so you know I said hey everyone's won't
wanted us to play this game rich you
know this was another thing unless you
have any other suggestions and you came
back with good
where's inversion
Oh
does it change it for you sure does it
changed it for you - it changes it for
both of us that's fine if you want Wow
I'll be fine like I'm I'll be fine I'll
I can deal I can deal I'll deal but yeah
just a heads-up game developer would
have been nice if we each got to
customize our own controllers yeah yeah
everyone is probably like two people
their baby pushes we book the sea no I
got it from a handful a handful of
people which is a lot like anyone who
goes out of their way to suggest a game
and then if I get multiples of the same
suggestion to keep holding it
and direction as you may have noticed
you will reach for things that you're
looking at if you can't grab something
or push a button
don't blame your hands blame your head
you may need to look up to grab
something that is high and you will have
to bend over to reach something that is
on the floor don't worry this is a safe
place this game is also on the switch
this would be a good switch game this is
this is a would be a fun couch co-op
game a silly game where you say hey
let's let's have a silly time punch them
buttons they will reach high and bend
low to achieve their goals
great pian fountain perfect
and grab opportunities with both of
their hands is it
you did it yet they can't fly and never
will there you go go okay okay so now we
kind of know how to solve puzzles kind
of you can jump I've already solved the
puzzle jack I did it st. cloud this
trained
I think you need to pull it out of the
way that actually makes sense Jack yeah
I don't you pull this one yeah we can't
jump too high the inversions gonna drive
me nuts now yeah I can I couldn't even
grab the other one and pull all we need
to go the other way Jack no push that
train later
all right now go
don't-don't-don't many go back and back
my home no it's fine well I still need
to get on this thing that's your fucking
problem there I got it dad it's fine I
got on thanks for your help
I've been I've been completely d
inverted this is okay we'll go just go
that's fine I can I can I can handle up
and tell you I can I can deal with a
girl man go I'm gonna train it's fair
it's fair puzzle solving solution
Oh No I need to get on I need to get on
there's a mandatory co-op and it seems
like you can't play this solo can you
maybe not this would be this would be
impossible unless you unless it's one of
those like was that the brothers where
you can like swap who you're controlling
oh maybe maybe one of those do you swap
you control
please customize your character easier
on that wait we can customize our
character
yes remote-control hunting anything
now there
push objects with your feet walk on top
can you read this yeah I understand what
they're saying what's the saying is push
it back that way push it back to the
wall I get this I get this 100% you can
grab with your feet no grab and then so
then what they're gonna ask you to do
now
so now hop up on it and then grab the
wall and Nina push it with your feet
yeah like that
yeah that's how you do it that's how you
do it
hold on let me look into something here
let's just let's finish this level and
then we'll we'll worry about customized
characters oh I want customized controls
right now that would be nice
that would sure be nice all the column
while walking on so we need to get over
there climb off the top of the stupid
thing I do I do want to climb up on top
of the super thing aka the Train okay
walk I'm too close to the edge well no
wait I've had to go this way away no I'm
fine
excuse me
okay we did it we're like the best
we're like the greatest human fell flat
place ever
yeah I'm fine as long as I don't touch
the camera stick at all we can put it
back ready to jump sure we know I'm fine
hello exist
are they waiting for something to update
this I'm reading the chat right now yeah
and I'm realizing that before the stream
started people in the chat we're saying

okay
I don't know nothing
we need to talk about a Nintendo level

like that's gonna be everybody's go-to
birthday gifts like oh johnny has a
Nintendo I'll get him one of these
things because then it's like he's doing
art but I don't know how much actual

all that time you want to be a
crash-test dummy no I'm the crash test
of it you just want to swap controllers
if you want I don't really care honestly

go nope
and off the wall get off the wall
oh so you hear away yeah Nintendo
directs before labo
lab oh yeah they did a Nintendo Direct
mini
in which they they said hey here's some
shit we're working on and included with
a bunch of shit like I mean a bunch of
shit was the for many people the big
announcement which was Dark Souls
remastered yeah is going to be on the
switch okay I think it's you know one it
means that they're you know they're
definitely working with from software to
like the switch is becoming the port
machine just you got a game we'll put it
on the switch will port it to the switch
how old is it we'll put it on the switch
it's hard for me to get excited about
this when I have a PC oh sure you know
all these all these remastered editions
and there may be on par with the PC
editions that came out ten years ago
well and the the the remastered edition
is also coming out on the PC and the ps4
and this is the remastered what is
remastered about a nicer looking smooth
you know cuz like that it runs at the
resolutions that the PC version ran out
when the PC version came out
no no because remember Dark Souls didn't
start off on a PC right it was is it
available on the PC the first one yes
but do er do you remember all the shit
we had to do to get dark souls 2 run
properly like we did a second program we
have to get dsfix just to get the thing
to run if you have that do you need the
a remastered edition i do i don't this
is a whole bunch of I don't know but I'm
looking forward to because you know we
and Dark Souls we got as far as we
streamed it for you and me and so you
know it'll be a nice excuse played on
the switch to to replay it again
okay climbing to fall properly you need
to get high this instructional video
will prepare it for everyone who does
not feel high enough and is ready to do
something about their situation climbing
is as easy as doing yells trying to pull
myself your difference being that yoga
leaps you where you started even have
done properly let's break it down raise
your hands
inhale optional approach the obstacle
lower your hands grabbing the obstacle
look down to pull yourself up walk
forward as you release your hands and
release timing is crucial releasing too
early or too late will not get you high
and you might as well do yoga instead
ah okay yeah this is it's doable go up
there already shit I was watching the
instructional video I was just climbing
man how'd you get up there
climbing man she's climbing man
here's what you do put your arms up in
there or ahead of time yeah
then jump
you gotta you gotta take your hand off
the camera but I jump alright look up
okay
just then if I'd like wait wait wait
look up okay looking up back away from
the wall
all right holding to both triggers walk
forward and jump now pull up you have to
like jump grab pull but then I have to
let go the camera button and my camera
goes back it's a jump you dig how'd you
do that
yeah look up yeah look up and do a grab
yeah for how do you keep looking up
while pressing the jump button just keep
your finger on the thumb and then last
second just take it off and jump you
might not even have to keep looking up
for all I really know I didn't really
yeah all right I don't think you have to
keep looking up so
yeah yeah how did you remove this yeah
oh wait no I didn't I just been running
jump from over here oh no that's where
you need it I think I think I just did a
goofy and it work I did it unintended
cuz I'm special I'm smart you are your
those are two things you definitely are
rich special definitely special
definitely special
I know and smart especially I'm smart
yeah damn it damn it
so in any case Derek with souls
remastered coming for the switch it'll
be nice it'll be nice it'll be it'll be
it'll be an excuse to play Dark Souls
really for me at least
grab on do it why are you flying up
there
pull back over here the train for the
whole train that's what I was trying to
pull the train back that's what I was
trying okay you get on it from up here
then I think my repeated attempts then
you can pull it you can if you want you
could pull the whole train over you know
by grabbing onto the wall but I've been
doing it like this I did it like this
the one time I did it and it's exciting
and it's exciting yeah there's an easier
way to get across there though you can
get back on the train and just pull the
train over
oh yeah that's way better
shit how do we get the rope back
how do we get the rope bag with jump for
it my rope
the rope where was the rope it was over
here and I'd tried to swing and then it
went bad oh shit we can do some of these
bars here hey these bars is loose jump
for it like a boss and maybe what I have
to do grab oh you did it I swing
swing your fucker
you can almost fit through these bars
Hey
I fit my body through yes fit my body
through the bars Richard no way my head
stuck your head I got my head stuck in
the bars damn it I don't think this was
the right way to go I'll be honest with
you hit it almost looks like my head can
fit though you know nope hey I got in
reach I got in the cave I'm in the cave

Wow what do I do here oh I got in a cave

whole thing over here I'm gonna go the
shortcut it's with me I'm gonna go I'm
gonna go the shortcut way rich if she
had me a man going the cave strats here
I found a cube
I found a green cube I am killing it at
this game uh-huh

green cube if there's an opportunity to
fall off something don't do it because I
have found a green cube I will wait for
the cube and now I am the king of the
cube what do I do with the cube that is
a great question but I have it where am
I
another great question

okay well then I'm dropping the cube no
I can't get back over there
the cubes down the cube I'm stuck in a
tree oh nice
crap
okay
and I'm done
but I got the cube I don't know what I
could do with this cube is there and do
you see any place over near the edge
where like we can put the cube can you
throw the cubes yeah you're all the way
at the beginning now I'm back at the
beginning but I have a cute
I just let's just I should just leave
what are we doing the cube
I found a glowing green cube oh yeah

window shit like you did it rich
bring it this way
I'm riding this
as I couldn't get I couldn't get in the
mother
bring the mother to me
yeah climb the mother put the roof on
the mother put the roof on the mother
okay we did it yeah okay get out of the
bucket now that's your job get out of
the bucket I made it over freedom
freedom to find more cubes really give
me some cubes rich took my cue
you took my ride yeah I did deal with it
deal with my QB revenge oh you didn't
mean the ride you were just being stupid
why what no I just walked right over the
hole I made well hey it's a push I think
I've been pushing it until you stopped
me from pushing it I feel like you
stopped me from pushing
this guy's all right
yeah it's kinda silly
it's a whole lot of silly that's
I'm gonna be okay I have the superior
intellect
I am the Khan to your check off okay
as as relates to what puzzles oh all
right
be it do it con I'll be over here check
it out
I'm checking out the next area you
puzzle it up over there I'm gonna look
over here in the construction zone
there's nothing
that's absolutely not
watch out below
I was nothing up here either
yeah my moves
how you extend the game's length this is
probably make the movement speed
insanely slow maybe no games are 10
hours long
legitimately moving slow was an artistic
choice yeah there we go there we go I
got the dumpster down wish did what no
oh but oh wait there's another dumpster
now I think came back
oh we must need that dumpster but for
what rich
got a wonder
it's over here
can we float in the dumpster
I got the mad strats yeah yeah well good
straight - yeah where are you would you
go I'm all the way over fucking here how
did you get over there with my elite
skills that's what well maybe if you
explain them to me well the point of ads
puzzle game Jack
I'm trapped over here if you can climb
like a liar you cannot
one arm he takes two arms pull yeah
takes two arms to pull you up is what
I've learned this might be a mistake
regret this
this might be a mistake and I might
regret this hour my middle names
yeah
nice game just one of me over it's cute
haha I figured out no I found a
different way what are you doing
I'd wildly jump to the arch and then
crawled along the top of the arch and
just kind of wiggled my way over here I
hit a switch okay I don't know what it
does yet okay
whatever this thing now that didn't move
okay do we want it to that's over here
did you hit this switch
nothing yet I'm saying we have to pull
out the support structures yep now hit
it
wait wait for me that demon
at the door go see if we can figure this
out
Wow look at that look at that you did it
okay okay
this game is growing on me more and more
puzzles everybody loves them who's that
do you see movement
kill kill me
aha
keep it stolen keep what still the
platform what no we need you back over
there
go back go back why explain here never
mind just stay stay by the box too late
too late
where's the where's the facepalm button
Hey look I'm back by the switch I made
it worse the facepalm button
come on back
okay flank go back a little wait wait
wait wait I think I got it move it just
a little bit that way so it's like a
straight platformer that crazy one yeah
we could probably deal with that okay
don't move don't move it we're going to
use it I'll jump on like I did less than
all right
oh and they've fallen off I think work
you have it's fine everything's fine we
nice to meet it still made it
that's all it matters still made it
what's up with this rock
oh crap it sounds windy as fuck outside
I think because it's windy as fuck
outside mm-hmm I'm gonna try something
stupid
nope
Oh God the rocks
let go like Oh buddy do it I can try to
throw me I don't think it works
oh we're just fine use you alright so
what do we do all these rocks
that's the question what do we do with
all these rocks where do we need to go
to shoot over that wall through this
wall I mean no way this shit over here
it's over there I don't know yet okay so
far a lot of nothing else where we came
from shit
if you just jump off you should come
back to me
should
I hope the solution isn't a build a
bridge no I'm sure there's a more
elegant way to do it but I can't think
of one so there's probably a smarter way
to do it
- mani raucous pole-vault I don't I
don't think that's likely no I can't
even imagine how one would pull bolts we
can stack rocks stack the shit out of
some rocks
that's about all we got use you come on
come on rocky boy there we go we can do
this we can do this we can do this
it's gonna be a better way of doing this
I'm thinking I can take my I got a small
plan okay so now what if we use that
blue guy over here yeah hang it off the
edge and when you know jump around mmm
Jack that might be the smartest thing
you've done the night yay rich said I'm
smart now we'll need to stack some rocks
on this side of it for Stan Stan I guess
thanks miles
hey well we gotta get a closer to the
edges up before this useful yeah now now
can you both move it sure with the rock
Jack's premature of the rock move the
rock move the record I just didn't want
it to fall I got I'm holding it all
right should we stay with her actually
here's the plan here's the plan move
back move back move back move back
all right rock me
wait I've crawled on top of the rock you
are rockets
that's my work no no yep
yeah I'm over all right another board
like out I mean you could or you can
just make it this is a speedrun of human
fell flattened I did fun to watch
actually that would be awful presuming
they don't just clip and skip back
alright Jack you want to move that log
yeah
okay so after I'd let you do the brisket
part I'll just let Jack take care of
that log
on top looks like a whole long sure
that's what it looked like
I bet you that's a whole lot of
something jack
yeah oh you did it from the Train yeah
I mean it might be something over here
maybe we can
get up there
get up there
and
and get up man
oh let's just go it's handy I've got a
box okay you continue boxing I'm gonna
explore this area over here a little bit
more
it does seem to be something about these
beams and whatnot
and perhaps if I could climb them you
don't great jack
I feel like I'm doing great you do look
great nope and I died I'm doing great
right doesn't it just seem like that's
like a Cuby area over there that seems
like an area full of cubes
I solved the puzzle Jack I've solved the
puzzle you did it I did it
great good job rich I'm very proud of
you
okay
okay
so what we need to do here
oh wait maybe
how do you just get over there it's a
platformer shit
what hi like that that's how you do it
oh great oh wait
easier alright

here you know
running this whole area yeah
I know exactly what I'm supposed to do
with it here you know I could go that
way
I don't see any green cubes they'll be
honest with you well we know how
important those green cubes are they
they were important to me let's see
what's over here it held the very
special put where are you trying to go
also I'm like where am I supposed to be
going where I'm at

the beginning yeah but I'm on top of
everything wait wait stop turn to your
right
no right keep turning keep turning like
you can make oh wait I think I just fall
down there and that's for the platform
yes can you jump all the way press there
let's cross there where are you I see a
green cube press more you shut up I do
where I think was watercrafts parents
have other schedules can you make that
jump
yeah
get up
get up
I think I've made some bad decisions in
regards to where I went why I went there
and basically what I've been doing this
whole time and now I follow okay
and now I've messed it up so I'm just
gonna kill myself and come back to you
hi hey I'm back nice to have you
nice to have you uh-huh what can I help
you with I have no idea great I'm just
starting to figure this one out I don't
know what we need to do yet also I broke
my arm there we go
also that was not a green cube it was
that sign right there oh I thought I
thought it was a cube was green and it
was a box No
thank you
this totally has to fall through there
right mm-hmm
we got to break that glass I think
behind you
oh yeah sure yeah
what does that do
Jack what just happen behind you you

swinging keep swinging
finally Jack grab onto my feet hopefully
a trapeze artist you think we can I
think you can I'm totally willing to bet
you can fly through the air with the
greatest of ease I'll be disappointed if
that's not a solution at some point we
great
Oh
just broke our
what a break the Lutter oh my god now we
have to trap he's up doo-doo-doo-doo did
he do did you do
I'm coming too Oh

[Part II]
okay what do we got here so jack is the
crash test I mean rich is the cop yeah
we got a rock
are you sure that's the right idea
nice work jack
I'll do it again I can smash I can smash
locks with rocks that is the extents we
actually have to get the thing out of
there
hey dude do we got here
pole hole got some bars oh wait I know
they do I can slip through these don't
worry I got this covered rich I've slept
through bars before I'm getting mine
right away through here oh hello look
this bar has got a bend in it hello
goodbye peace out man
interesting they grow back I thought it
sorta been back but I must have been
just a trick of camera positioning I
think you bend them I did I used to I
used a tool though oh I just I'm like a
unlike a wild animal Mike I just I just
use my body
no no don't don't press the release
button that's the really fun oh you're
doing the I'm cranking yeah Jax or
anything in the the catapult no why do
you want to go in the capital how could
you go into the car bolt and check see
what's going on I I mean one of us
should go in the catapult yes ready yeah
there's the facepalm bone huh no we're
both going on this grand rich Kansas's
I'm happy about it
all right try it again try it again
you get there
all right come back in rich
I'm ready to send you flying
I'm over Stonehenge actually might do
something useful I wonder if we could
move this and calculate some macho
device don't engine is there a lover or
something to turn no but I think I might
be moving it I might be were like
wheeling it oh my god you guys complain
so much you talk about the chat I'm
assuming he's checking plenty about
something we're not complaining about
much right now
now we're seven good time I know that's
unusual for me I could talk about how
blah Star Trek discovery is sure sure
how they've they've turned one of the
great sci-fi franchises do a sci-fi
channel original ooh
your hand out of it get your hand out of
there
Oh fun I think I am I'm pushing this
like a way it's true no I don't think
far escape was exclusively a sci-fi
already that was in conjunction with the
Jim Henson studios and some kind of
Canadian TV show oh you can turn that
we're totally hitting Stonehenge okay I
don't think it's gonna do anything for
us except for hate Stonehenge yes all
right it's your shot rich all right all
right we're gonna go oh oh oh nice
well now we gotta knock down the other
one you know what I don't know we need
to slice his charm it's not gonna do
anything for us she's gonna land here I
think we do it you want - he wants it
we've started this
and it should be about right back
that's honey little baby rock okay Jack
Ridge could you explain to my girlfriend
what this game is I got him to turn off
friends to watch this stream yeah this
is a physics-based puzzle game called
human fall flat you apparently use
physics to do things but your character
controls kind of goofy like like an
Octodad would know but you know I think
the awkward controls is part of the
charm
all right and yeah you just have to
figure out how to get through the door
like this one actually I think we need
to catapult one of us right
oh no you can get through this
what's your plan to unhook that thing
with this tool oh shit I fell off I'm
gonna pick the lock you're gonna you're
gonna see fit oh come on it's not really
working okay maybe I need a bigger you
work on that okay
I'll work on climbing up excuse you
it seems like there's multiple solutions
even which is nice yeah look there's a
little window right here where that
leads
oh yeah scroll through the window so you
don't need the catapults or the door
pick lock thing oh that's the least fun
solution well I'm just you know finding
solutions I get it
no not there between the door
you keep working on that I'll just clips
through
we never work
yeah refused to go
keeps glitching the lock is on the other
side of the lock it looks like a bar
that's just sitting in some pegs and I
wanted to like lift it up by shoving
something through there that that looks
like it should be a valid solution but
maybe it's not but it wasn't easier way
to do it but I just don't care this
looks like the fun method catapult
yourself over
do it I think that's kind of what this
game is all about is like yeah how do
you feel like getting over here
- sorry about Michael burn up in a
fucking boat it took me a while to
remember - Michael you know
it's not your grandfather's the Star
Trek like my grandfather Star Trek just
fine no green cube up there rich yeah
it's just I mean it's not it's not
terribly exciting it's not it's not a
terribly exciting show and you know it's
not very Star Trek II I've been like the
names of things it's not very Star Trek
II at all yeah you know like I've said a
few times like I think they do have a
couple good episodes here they're like
the the time minute at the time I think
I think good is being a bit generous it
was okay well maybe not they had a
couple good premises but they had a
couple good setups exact same premise
was done better and and TNG yeah no but
gritty war I don't know serialize drama
drama oh so I guess that means I guess
that means discovery is better oh yeah
is this something I can go in you can
push me in yeah I don't think you can go
in the fire but it doesn't it seem like
you should be able to eat yeah
we might need that carton you might need
that cartridge
I was hoping I could use the cart to
like bash this door in this one thing
it's not a thing
swimming I just checked swimming is not
a thing I can see that see if I can
bashing this door in again but I'm just
not gonna go fast enough
so then we just need the cart over here
those - no what's up there a whole bunch
of nothing man
okay
okay
now kind of wish we hadn't destroyed the
wall
why
might be a lead over here yeah but you
can't already there's no stairs over
there that's not a secret area rich
get-together
oh crap fuck we go
yeah okay okay okay oh so what I mean I
don't even know if there's anything else
to talk about like what's in the news
you know like nerd wise there's not a
whole lot going on anyone can catch
black lightning the black lightning TV
show here's something I saw a blurb
about it here's something crazy is CW
added a new superhero show to the roster
that's not part of the air overs Oh
black lightning there's not going to be
a part of the universe as of right now
that seems silly considering how popular
the arrow verse is I'll probably there
isn't that really my grand scheme of
things I don't know people they're still
on how popular is any show if it's still
on very not can mildly mildly
floundering
let's go but oh gosh dang it all the way
back to the beginning
Oh barely made that
so yeah new a new superhero show I
caught the UH I caught the pilot it was
alright it was alright I was ok with it
not
they they had an intra they did have a
couple interesting bits and I'm looking
forward to how they explore them because
you know the the the deal with Black
Lightning is he used to be a vigilante
but then he gave it up for his family
and became the principal designee
already yeah the the thing the season
premiere just aired I won't say
yesterday so I became a principal local
high school and he had a little blurb
about how he's been able to save more
lives as an educator yeah then he ever
has his black lightning and that made me
think about how we've joked about how at
this point Bruce Wayne is just doing it
to beat up yeah poor people and like how
he could do so much more with his wealth
than be Batman right and so I'm hoping
that that idea is explored a bit in
Black Lightning the idea of like you
know what good can superpowers do so on
NPR called Black Lightning the first
show on TV with a black protagonist had
to yell at my radio oh that does seem a
bit extreme that's clearly not the first
show on TV with a black protagonist the
first superhero show perhaps whatever
trying to think of other superhero shows
are we counting cartoons laughs static
shock
static shock right you might not count
cartoons a lot of people a lot of Lipa
which is not actually on TV I was gonna
say a lot of people don't count Netflix
yeah a lot of people do not count
Netflix and so if you're looking at
superhero shows obviously it's not the
first ever TV show with a black
protagonist but if you're looking at
superhero shows on TV spawn was a black
superhero on TV decades ago that's what
that was a cartoon right yeah yeah
live action we're going live action here
are you still black when your flesh has
been rotted off he was black before
Robbie was black so this one was black
yeah well now he's like a demon so yeah
he's no he's demonic rotting protoplasm
I don't know help me help me think of
something I they nut off the top of my
head of course someone's gonna like
mention the one I'm gonna go oh but I'm
saying the Mantis which I'm not and
super familiar with it sounds vaguely
familiar I don't know what Mantis is I'm
sorry
'we do what a TV show
was it a TV show I think us Mozart could
about a blade TV show I just know our
big dog we're just not familiar oh I I'm
not familiar with the blade TV show I'm
sorry I is there that's they're saying
they're saying blade that's that's what
they are saying yes there was a TV show
oh well then there you go and then you
know the question is I guess did they
treat that as a superhero show or as a
vampire show and I know blade has always
like rode the line but blades not a
superhero then neither is the Punisher
well right but I guess both bait blade
and Punisher are anti-heroes but there's
there's less fantastic elements The
Punisher he's just a guy with guns makes
him a superhero is he likes to wear
skull on his chest I can't get this
stupid lock out I have no idea what
mantis is he's is not the only
protagonist what the arguably arguably
the most popular member of the a-team
was mr. T's crew to add and howling mad
Murdock obviously is comic relief even
my favorite dude did it do
the black Albert's super I have no idea
you guys keep saying mantis and I'm
going to keep saying I don't know what
mantis is yeah I think I saw the pilot
years ago it sounds like a sounds
vaguely familiar and that I don't think
anything happened with it I got I mean
do they actually successfully make it a
show or did it get cancelled like right
away oh you don't even know if it was a
show needs to be picked up for at least
you know half a season there are no
official standards for this no of course
not I guess what I'm saying what I'm
saying is if if a TV writer says you
know first superhero show with a black
protagonist right now we're having
trouble coming up with another one so
wouldn't it's not like named a bunch of
shows what we've named a bunch of them
well but with the normal caveats not
animated alright alright with the
caveats I think it's perfectly
acceptable the show I mean who knows how
good it's gonna be like I said it was
like well when will we have the first
action series with a black protagonist
who is also wearing red pants that's the
real question
it's these you know that not animated
seems like a fairly arbitrary
restriction no cuz animated shows it's
not the same thing
Wow with the hook interesting take on
that are you think that's the take you
have to take not sure because generally
animated means not in primetime and so
you know like at primetime shows I don't
know what the criteria are I don't know
what the criteria are
get in the house this game kind of looks
like octo did yeah you know it's it has
goofy controls it does it does it's not
100% Octodad but yes got it Jack grab my
legs and get extra momentum okay I'm
coming time this just right I thought I
did
all right
all right maybe yeah and back and we got
it forward and back forward back go
first cuz I'm ready you're holding on to
me why are you holding on to me oh my
god oh my god oh my god oh my god
I got your rich I got you don't worry I
got you
I sure you everything's okay here I come
okay hamster wheel pretty obvious barely
not that obvious maybe this way am i
doing anything yes you're lifting this
rock great you did it jack you did it
great netflix has more clout than CW so
that's a weird argument it's it's still
different the difference being one is a
paid one is a subscription service and
so it's the same reason why HBO doesn't
count even when you talk about basic
cable right because you have to pay
extra for for HBO and you have to
because you have to pay for Netflix it's
a subscription service and so it doesn't
count as basic TV how do we get you over
here I can drop this plank down I don't
know if that'll help you or hurt you
also there's another hook I see that I
see that oh listen it all counts as TV
but it's different than standard
television Oh careful something that's
too steep for you to climb I would also
assume that here hold on wait wait can
you grab that grab the top yeah over
here I don't want to fall don't fall
perfect Oh can you lower the the rock a
little bit oh sure sure I'm good oh no
that's bad
perfect
about that actually yeah this could work
lower it all the way okay we got this we
got this thing with the internet the
definitely oh right well the definition
of television is becoming more fluid
because now it's just shows that we
watch on our TV but there is still a
huge difference between what is shown on
free TV versus what is shown on page
Jenny
check it out jack just lift this a
little bit all right tell me try
stopping there okay it's gotta go a
little bit more going super slow
yeah that's that's totally work we
fucking did it we fucking did it great
look at that I got fuckin contraption
that's a fucking contraption boom we did
it we did it
lots of people don't on TVs cable isn't
free right cable isn't free and that's
what I'm saying that's why CW ABC NBC
Fox CW but does anyone really care about
the network's any CBS oh well no but I'm
just saying by definition of those are
things that you can get without having
to pay a subscription for okay and so
therefore the definition of them
therefore that it has a slightly
different definition than your Netflix
or HBO's or cable or or whatnot right
network TV versus everything else when
it comes to quality obviously we're
seeing a lot more from the from the paid
service but
I guess what like I know exactly what to
do okay
there you go I don't know oh no nope are
you upset with me J is he trying to say
you pay extra for premium channels no
there's a I'm saying there is a
difference between network television
and any sort of subscription service
which should not be this mind-blowing
revelation to everyone we had to ride
the barrel down there and I fucked us
know anything you need I think they
would provide just need the momentum oh
yeah and I jumped at the end
this game should be called drunk
simulator yes there's a window up there
don't drop the barrel for having such a
good time
yes did it
I'm in now what is that always the
question rich shit isn't that always the
question
No
my official review is this game is cute
rich I'm gonna say that's a really fair
official review as it is also very true
these windows I think there's something
out this one that's all about they're
cracking it huh
I think we can get up there but I just
fucked it up last night yeah you don't
want to go out those windows oh there's
a there's a rope see the rope
no who's that going that's gonna way up
to that Tower
interesting interesting
anyways climb with a frickin rope
brother Oh probably man raggedy man I
had no idea network stuff was ever free
network stuff is still free
just got a shitty reception no it's it's
all HD now like it's it's HD television
still get a shitty perception man to the
channel doesn't come in at all instead
of just being fuzzy he just cuts out
it's actually much worse
really yeah oh yeah no we actually we
got a nice uh we got a nice Santana and
network television is still free yeah
you get yourself a nice HD antenna
they're gonna ask us the tightrope walk
I think they're going to ask us to like
hand-over-hand climb no it's not Jack
what I don't know but Network tell these
people don't have rabbit ears on their
TV because you can get TV for free you
can get TV for free you absolutely can
so I don't know what world you've been
living in where you don't get TV for
free but I don't pay for cable and I've
occasionally watched rarely something on
network TV network television is for
free no you did it that's done Fox n CW
are part of your free network television
yes well and you know what in Milwaukee
they are I don't know how it is wherever
you are
but in Milwaukee we got NBC ABC CBS FOX
CW and one more all this kind of cute
where'd you go as I opened a portal
ickis around what's the gate called it's
not unfortunately
oh just look at the patella kisses these
little rock rooms right
oh I opened up the castle gates all I
know great you did it no I can't quite
get this
sacrifice myself did you go up here
I came actually back down hey you up
there I want to see if I can get out
this tightrope can I know you go back
now you came from my open table Gabe
that was closed
alright that at least pull down the lamp
oh look there's over here there's the
whole thing oh I can go ring the bell
ring the bell you go do that there's
another catapult there's a whole nother
area over here man I know when you win
I'm heading over with this windmill
where the fuck are you oh how long let
me get to the top and I'll show you yeah
I think I see what you're oh yeah I'm
Way up here how did you get there but
not the other window I see it do you see
it see what what you do how you get down
the rope well yeah oh that's super
exciting yeah if I can you get that to
work it's gonna be amazing
okay hell I need to grab a little more
to the edge
okay
I do it
it's like I did it
and out have done it I didn't know no oh
well every spawn are you fucked I hope
it responds
oh my god I'm way the fuck over here
your life is fine here
I don't want to be over here
did you fix your arm fix your arm
what are you working on
this one no thing
ah no no idea where the fuck I'm
supposed to go I think at this point
we're just freestyling
how much co-op with this co-op game yeah
it's just a nice bonus yeah do a co-op
do it by yourself both of you fuck
around I think that's fine
whoa whoa well I was lucky back in the
window I almost fell to my grisly death
but then I landed back in the window
everything is just a little bit gummy
which I'm sure is very intentional god
damn it god damn it I really hope that
thing responds that uh that hook you
missed your only chance to get it
I might have that's also a big
possibility
oh it's half of the window you did it
don't what is there it was there a green
cube up there no oh well then then
nothing matters the only thing that
matters are green cubes where do we come
from where do we come from where are we
going I can only assume we're going to
that bridge that you opened down
but I want to see what else in a cave or
something I'm there in there I want to
see what other trouble we can get into
first there's all these little areas
over here all right nope there's all
these little areas over here I want to
go explore I want to see if the I think
there's a secret in there and when a
jack style secret Oh get it man get it
get it I'm gonna head up these stairs
I'm stuck
oh the hook did not respond rich the
hook did not respond
I'm terribly sorry for your loss I'm
gonna cave now I can't get to the bell
I'm severely severely disappointed in
everything back up there Jack there's no
way you wouldn't respond if you threw it
off the ledge oh there we go now we're
talking Thank You Chad that's a
wonderful suggestion unless the hook in
fact doesn't respond well either way I
can full of shit either way I got a non
responding hook nope
hey I'm up on the windmill with you I'm
up on the windmill you're not a ho the
windmill that was so so ten minutes ago
oh wait a minute where was I where was I
going there's a cave under the one and
all that I'm currently exploring Jack I
don't want to be over here though
I want to go back I want to go back to
my tower there's a cave underneath the
windmill yeah I'm just hearing that now
that's that's great you're just hearing
that now just I'm you know it took me a
while to process that information
there's nothing in this cave okay how do
I get to work
wait how did you get over here what you
mean over where the windmill I got over
to the windmill what I mean but how what
do you mean where are you at I point the
camera at the window
you're just jump over the fence
what fence are you talking about what
are you talking about drop full and turn
around it's right there turn left left
let's not down there what you trying to
get up the windmill or no I'm trying to
get back to where I was okay gosh dang
it okay where's the fence well you I
thought you're trying to get to the
windmill if you're trying to get away
from the windmill right I have no idea
how the fuck you do it I swung across a
lamp to get here I'm trying to get away
from the window
I'm trying to get back to my special
castle that's where I'm going
it
hip amen
I've got a an pillo that's interesting
huh did you explore the cave yeah I
didn't see anything too interesting in
there huh okay
Oh Frick do I get out of here into this
house is that where we started no that's
like the end if I climb upon this house
I'm gonna get back so you're screwed I
know maybe you can jump down there and
climb up the cave if you want to go back
Jack yes see where I'm at see I'll go in
this way
you shouldn't down there I'm going this
way nope is that the starting point oh
that's where I'm going well it's
different Stonehenge yeah
wake up that's interesting I don't know
what we've skipped if anything this is
kind of weird
wake up
what's going on you can't reach it yeah
we're gonna find a way damn it this is
simple
I want to see what's up there I wear a
pool up this little hill by this house
from where I'm at well then go do it I'm
just gonna jump wait wait come here come
here out here here you're doing a run
you're doing it wrong come here and
Grammys you're doing it wrong yeah
you're doing it wrong trying to help me
jump across this stupid gap make
yourself a diving board get yourself
some extra distance okay
hold on to it wait wait we got an anvil
with no remember me you see this anvil
yeah what's this like something you know
something
oh I know but it's this thing
Jack do me a favor but you see every but
back with the house what the house yeah
you see that anvil yeah I see the anvil
alright I need you to grab the involute
it on the back of this board okay coming
to you ready ready
there you go all right
oh shit does that work
it's it I'm in have you checked out this
area that area you weren't interested in
checking out earlier because you wanted
to get over here well I was I just
wanted to be able to get over there but
you know it's like I don't let him I
didn't like man I didn't need to be over
there
this whole there's like a little hill
you can get up over here did you get up
the hill
ah no yeah no interested in the hill
earlier well I'm just
you gotta be something else you got me
on this whole this whole bore I was a
Nepal tangent I was looking at something
else you're the one who built the diving
board and jumped off it I would have in
my own due time but then I was button
you know I'm just over here now I'm
gonna get this log
no don't come here log come here
bad luck get up on the stairs get up on
the stairs dance till you feel better
whoa damn mass log
alright alright I gotta grab him I gotta
grab his castle you gotta grab this
castle to her I'm in I did it I did it I
did it oh shit there's a there's a hole
there's a hole in your bucket dear Eliza
there's a hole in the bucket dear Liza
dear Liza errors all hole in my bucket
I'm caring for the only ones who knew
that song it's adorable the dear Liza
song is adorable yeah uh yeah you know
it's fine song
the board is clipping motherfucker
well
thinking if I put this board if I put
this log like in the door then it won't
roll which so far has been like the
biggest hindrance to me using the log as
a platform to get on the roof
I got in no what no what oh oh I
accidentally ended the level oh look I
was just about to get on the roof no I
think the the trapdoor not me I didn't
even know it was the exit I was just
getting to the roof motherfuckers trying
to stop exploring Jack I just
accidentally solved the puzzles I didn't
have the anvil or the board anymore you
should have dropped them over the cliff
rich took them away from me dropped them
over the cliff
no they dropped over the cliff when you
when you win fuck you man I'm rolling
away nope not without me do your job
I'm pulling all of this do your job
better this is perfect this is exactly
that's a puzzle that you need infants
because you're one person rode you we
did it we did it
this game looks infuriating not really
no it's cute it's cute the ferris wheel
if you can get over there
I can see it left left okay
you can feel the rudder I'll control the
wind
well moving just backwards
point is we're moving
perfectly serviceable motorboat in that
way
we're moving
would I would kind of love of run button
feeling that's a form of artificial life
generally shot
it's a weird button by the way
look what happens if you press X yeah
play dead button that's weird I know
that's a weird button
it's a weird button having the video
game you know it's got some kind of
function we have not discovered yet Jack
sure okay where did you go exploring
Jack exploring
this is also not a fair you call it at
first but someone to continue to call
them first I'm just a water wheel I know
you know but we pick the name yeah and
I'm sticking to it Jack that's fine
that's fine you want to get in the
motorboat yes do I want to get in the
motorboat are we going in the motorboat
what else is over here
that's the real question is what else is
over here you know what pause alright
never mind don't bother
here I'll play dead you taking a break
how's everyone doing long cuz we're all
doesn't sound like a bad suggestion I
don't know how we're gonna push it on to
the logs though I don't know how
feasible that is
get a little water Jack we have a plan
you we have a plan try and roll the
water boat on these logs to get to the
water that's a great plan do you think
just the two of us could move it or
would that just be cheating pushing me
into the water it's okay I got in the
boat now you all right you want to steer
I kind of want to throw you under the
water why we all got in we all got in
the boat al I'll be um
he's doing great that way
yeah that looks great yeah let's go to
boat first and depending upon your
camera to see where I'm going if you
keep swimming around can you stop the
boat can you stop the boat how am I
gonna stop the boat
you're controlling the boat and I having
control of jack shit oh I got on a rock
I did I was fairly confident you were
controlling the boat couldn't see my
camera was dedicated to be swiveling
around the thing are you good swimming
this one
okay hey stop stop
okay I feel like I've feel like I'm on a
cycle of shame of shame
okay what's on the boat what's on the
boat what's happening I asked some
lepers okay there you did it
No oh my god
Jack here's our way to steer I can
control Oh
give me a moment I can come up there
let's find out how to get
aye aye captain
okay
that's where you want to go where are we
going right around by the lighthouse
sure put yours forward does it turn us
that turns us then we both go forward we
turned
okay forward ho no forward
that's okay slowly wants to silence
applying pressure
it's going all the way forward
there you go can't stop us now don't
stop me now this is game of a goal it's
just exploring well there's an exit you
gotta find it seems in every level right
so go in the dock turn yours back go
back all the way back here oh yeah
he back a bit more back
like a glove all the way to the end
like a glove
nice did it so there's this red thing
here right and then there's this piece
of equipment that has all the hook the
things to hook so my I'm guessing we
gotta be crane operators okay
that's what I'm that's what I'm assuming
riveting gameplay it's actually kind of
neat physics puzzles I approve of this
game just because you're a sourpuss and
want to see us hiding in a bush for two
hours in the pub gee doesn't mean it's
gonna happen every time oh hello who
though we do get you know we get some
excitement from the pub gee
haters are gone teens haters are the
kind of people that grow in the Dead
Rising series smoke cool Tom be
though--well do with your timer right
there gameplay wait there thing to do
right they just he cut off mombi's as
long as you want
and you follow the story it's very
important that I be able to follow the
foot I like to challenge
all right we have to lift those onto
here question is why do we want why do
we even want to bother where do we want
to go with these crates ah let's think
about this like we probably want to get
to the other side they're right by that
building up on that building or at least
over that did that other catwalk
sure
when I just do that now
what do we get for moving these crates
can you lift it up
I hope yeah but why why do we want any
of this huh what do we get what do we
get out of this no I must explore and
meditate I just know that this is the
thing we got to do cuz here's the big
red button you know this big red button
says oh I do something oh yeah you
almost crushed yourself I almost fell
down just dumb sure that happens you
know can we put it there's a little area
so these okay so we want to get up here
hmm how do we get up here with the
crates I don't know
that orange one is probably the key
because it's tall enough to jump up on
mm-hmm how much mobility do you have
with that back back forth back forth
this way and up and down I wonder if I
could not I there's no pivot but lean
the crane down on you see that can't
walk up above me yeah
like the top portion there then the
bottom half just going down here and
then we walk up get to the other side
mm-hmm that's the plan I think I don't
know like look up you can see how far
the crane goes out yeah does it go out
that far I think oh it does all right
cool
I think that's the play um let me get it
down so we can get the hooks yeah I'll
do the hooks
over more oh yeah I get towards me or
towards forward can you move it over
straight ahead from your perspective a
little bit
wait stop stop good actually it's over
too far bring it back closer stop over a
little bit more towards you
stop
raise it a little bit just a touch very
finicky controls I understand but do you
back into the lab wait now I got one I
got one don't touch anything back into
the left
stay in there all right move it left
stop
can you move it left a bit more
yeah
stop it's not gonna go can make Senor
depressed tonight tell you something
funny and I don't I don't know if I have
anything terribly funny for you um can
you lower it I need more slack just a
little bit just touch I don't want to I
don't want to unhook the other ones I
mean we might be able to do it with just
these right oh you got it
rich what do you have funny wise nothing
I don't got it I don't got too much
funny man I don't got too much funny for
and I'm sorry about that
it's not a lot of funny happening right
now you got this rich
I don't do anything just yet think I
think that's it oh you're getting on
yeah
Lilla
wait to rob son okay yeah a little bit
more forward if you can is that it
that's it
try lowering why don't you get off on
the surface now oh yeah yeah it's good I
do just in case I Biff this
it's probably too harsh of an angle
right try it try it it's like a little
bit this way looked on the one side that
might not be a problem if you just try
to push back a bit
yeah maybe
yeah that was a nice team puzzle that
was so for my oh there's a hidden wall
right there oh she can't get through the
thing can you get around the edge they
were not expecting need to go through
that yeah you know you do raisin
so the hooks are up so you go through
that you could totally get through there
very raising it then I just got to go
back I know I know
like a chump
uh let's see here you know what I can
talk about rich this does not affect you
in any way and it barely affects me but
a YouTube has started deep partner izing
smaller channels oh yeah this they say
this was a backlash too you know kind of
the some of the not so nice things that
some YouTube partners were doing some
some bad content okay but really it's
just it's punishing smaller channels and
it's saying you need to meet certain
thresholds to be partner you need to
have you know so many views and view
hours per month you need to have so many
subscribers right or else you can have
partners in it so like for example my
personal YouTube channel which I never
upload to got deep partner eyes okay
I said hey your deep partner eyes get
out of here we're fine you know we we
meet the criteria so previously recorded
is fine but the interesting note that
that I was reading about today is that
YouTube is also doubling down on a rich
oh my lord I'm so sorry I've wanna just
pick up twice right in right in the
microphone YouTube is also doubling down
on the creation of original content with
YouTube red yeah and so some people are
theorizing that this is YouTube's
Netflix esque pivot to original content
yeah
and as anybody subscribe to YouTube red
uh you know what I have been for a
couple months
yeah and it's great what do they have
it's worth an an ad-free viewing
experience so worth it
they have the ability to hear something
that's huge with YouTube Brad and I'm
probably gonna cancel it because I'm not
gonna use it much anymore
but I was going on I was you know I was
traveling a lot during the holidays and
I was going to want to watch a couple
longer YouTube videos on the plane but
of course the plane spotty Wi-Fi who
knows if they're gonna be able to watch
the video you with YouTube red you can
download YouTube videos to watch later
right so that's why I bought it
I got it I got it for just a month
thinking I'll download some videos watch
them on the plane and then cancel it but
I've just been really enjoying the
experience I miss YouTube you know it's
going it's it it could be that they they
want to go the route of original content
creation and if that's the case there's
gonna be a problem you're such a bad
jack don't we create original content we
do but YouTube doesn't control it I know
YouTube doesn't own that that doesn't do
any I and if you guys if we don't run
ads on our stuff we're just taking up
server space man that's all we are is a
drain on server you know what was
probably the the worst thing I do over
there does complicated goofy thing Oh
see this a hole in the bar over here I
just jump through it jumped right
through it man what are you doing
you find his moves a red thing the gate
man H when all you have is a hammer
though the whole world is a nail so in
case you want to know what probably the
final nail in the YouTube coffin will
end up being is patreon yeah yeah think
about it think about it for 100 for one
hop YouTube gets nothing out of it so if
you have a patreon you might decide not
to run ads on your video because you're
getting it through pay your patrons
right but then YouTube well they get
nothing they get nothing except for you
taking up their server space and so with
with how popular things like patreon
patreon has been I'm betting that's
what's like that and people who use ad
blockers and I'm stuck you can you can
get through or maybe not
people who use ad blockers stuff like
that like these are all the reasons why
YouTube is trying to pivot to something
more sustainable your head stuck I know
it is I'll be getting through you can do
it rich you can do it it's getting worse
how can I get worse
there's a better solution over here look
I'd be happy just to get my head free
right now right
Jackie you pull me out yeah put yeah
it's good this could turn out to be to
our benefit I got an idea oh wait I got
an idea wait I'm gonna use your corpse
oh my god that's brilliant okay step on
your corpse to get pardon me original
can you jump on mine cards that's what
I'm trying hard me rich you know any
time now
stay still here we go here we go getting
over getting over
there we go and I've come so far I don't
want to I mean I can't pull you out
perhaps I could push you oh wait maybe I
could lift you up maybe I could lift you
up
can you just climb on the stoop then
grab me lift
I don't know I don't know what we can do
about this rich this is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen here
jump up my body jump yeah we did it
alright Jack grab the other end of this
box let's stack them okay we're gonna
make stairway to heaven
okay do we want to do that over here
over we're like just over here what's
over here
Oh like that looks like and goes into a
big thing of water that big vat yeah
what something inside here that another
vet nope that didn't work out now you
get stuck Jack I'll go get more boxes
Thanks come on bucks I got another box
and you know I can deal with that
well I'm just gonna even nothing on the
other side of this we're doing just dumb
wrong things that's always a possibility
that might be like the mission statement
for the game dude um wrong things all
right you know that is that's a great
it's a great staircase crappy staircase
there you go it's a great staircase
and we're just exactly where we were man
we're just exactly where we were
it's not easy building stairs this game
should have in toddlers don't you agree
shot like giant toddlers yes perhaps
alien toddlers maybe these are alien
toddlers what is it you're trying to do
build the stair take it over the top
easier okay I can you climb on that now
can you get over the fence from from
that starting position yes yes what's
over there what's over there okay this
thing no this thing is over here oh oh
there's lots of stuff over here
yeah oh there's stuff with chains I can
what is that it's like a boat thing
looks like a boat thing Oh
drainage pipe how are you okay you're a
boat how do we make you go boat go boat
i'm on a boat
oh my god that's the game because that's
the game is make things hard go this way
vote
rich yeah we can swim
okay all right don't worry I'm figuring
out a puzzle you just keep worrying and
getting over that wall boom I just
figured it out I got a puzzle beat
my favorite thing about this game it's
like to to get like revved up you have
to go like this like you just really
have to like it's almost like you're
praising the next jump like please jump
come to me land it's great not too fast
No I'm getting out of here man first of
all that's great
can you pull me through from this end I
don't even know if I can get back to you
over here oh wait maybe I can No
yeah I rich yeah oh well you're stuck so
I never mind I think we might have been
really dumb about how we get over that
wall yeah yeah I think we might have
been I don't know if I can get to you
but I will try that's all right I could
just read tips or something my hand
okay so rich yeah here's what you do
take a box and drag it into that one Oh
God
here's what I'm thinking do you think
the box floats yes I do
thinking if you stack the boxes up there
cuz that's where I landed I'm like right
over there I'm thinking I'm thinking
that might be the key to all this I
think it's very possible that we were
very dumb don't tell anyone though or
else we'll lose all of our cred as true
gamers
where you taking your hop on that boat
I'm at the door I open the door already
just gone the door huh just going the
door well it's not the exit are there's
more get up oh yeah you got to get up
for us to fall off of it he won't get up
I'm sure toddlers are the inspiration
for this fucking thing oh sure there's
more rich there's more to do I'm pods on
that you know that's fair that's fair
man we can just read names we'll be done
hey mentally exhausted because of
because my head was jammed that's fair
man
praise the Sun
that's fair man indestructible babies
are minutes away from three hours in the
stream that's a short stream what do you
want to don't like more on your own or I
need a break then I'll find something to
play okay I'll find something to play
well you shut her up here yeah let's see
what we got
yeah
I'm not playing pub G and she deleted
for space oh did you download it we
don't need no pub G I think I figured we
were done with him for a while I am yeah
even at home I'm finding it hard I ain't
playing no pub G I'll find something to
play fight of gods you could have done
you could have deleted fight of gods
just the do G or the steam version well
this is Jack's game so it's Jack's
version on Steam oh yeah I got it
through a steam bundle there was like a
there's like a four we haven't been
reading tips this whole time haha yeah
there was a like a four game that was
like fun weirdo games that you could get

[Part III]
that you could get Jake any status
updates on the n64 situation you still
haven't played Diddy Kong Racing I still
haven't played Diddy Kong Racing that's
true that is absolutely true rich the
only update is that I have not been
thinking about it okay which I know is
not a very good update that's not the
update you want so we haven't read any
tips today then alright you've not read
I don't think that too many I realized
we're not reading shit
so we're not that bad good good please
depressing madam says best the worst fun
fact Slade Craven actor John Mann is a
Canadian musician diagnosed with early
onset Alzheimer's a few years ago that's
depressing oh that is the present
Slade Craven was the rock singer in high
voltage not high voltage
the plane woman he was like Marilyn
Manson yeah turbulence maybe just
turbulence was it just turbulence I mean
I wouldn't doubt I wouldn't I wouldn't
doubt that I just forget I just forget
that's too depressing to read Wow
chat you guys are you guys are with us I
like that you're with us in our funk
come 907 Suns I just watched your AVP
commentary I wonder whether you ever get
around to seeing the second one and
whether you are optimistic about the
upcoming Shane Black predator film then
are like three years o on the Shane
black predator film I don't know I give
it a shot
Shane Black is a terrific director a
terrible writer either
oh yeah that's yeah that's also true
that's also true
Shane Shane black is good at the things
that Shane Black does so yeah
tired sad I just oh thank you
who is an artist that has a major public
scandal that you still enjoy their work
to an extent hey it's probably Mel
Gibson and Woody Allen's work hey I
don't have a great answer
I just don't write gonna be sick of
talking about celebrities who have done
horrible horrible things can I be done
with that apparently not apparently the
answer is no you cannot I don't know yet
IV a they'd be a tough they'd be a tough
call Paul Rubens I barely did anything
wrong he fuckin he jerked off in a porno
theater you know he didn't do it in some
kids face he didn't drag a woman behind
an alley and shove it in her face he
just jerked off at a porno theater well
you know you he didn't hurt anyone
except for maybe the janitor
fatal error oh it did not like that it
did not like that at all
wait you can't jerk off from porno
theaters no you can't which is why the
the cops were there literally as like a
quota system whether like yeah let's go
down to the PO nathie and arrest some
people just because like they knew they
could arrest people that night like yeah
we gotta arrest someone yeah let's go
arrest someone and it just so happened
to be Paul Reubens yeah that's like the
thing with the old-school porno theaters
and Oquendo says what year what was your
favorite weapon and starting class and
blood ball I recently started playing
and I'm blown away by how good it is
thanks for the streams and the great
reviews the classes that was basically
just some early minor stat differences
right yeah I didn't I didn't even pay
attention to the class well I kind of
did a little bit because one of the
things the staff said I wanted to build
up but one of those higher to start work
for
hey as far as starting Weapon X you know
and I used the the song thing the
soughing the soft saw blade oh yeah I
like that saw blade some big part of
that axe that big heavy attack fucks
things up early game saw cleaver Thank
You sparkly yeah I love that song
cleaver that was mine that was my jam
I was never overly impressed by the whip
and I wanted to be I feel it I feel like
the whip was the hard weapon or it's
like if you want to show off you use the
whip and so like I wanted to use the
whip but I was never good enough
got around flavas be able to dress like
a teddy bear
apparently just the player player model
I chose oh sure do you get the thing is
you just because just guys this cosmetic
okay
twenty-eighth dresses important question
you guys think screenwriters will ever
be replaced by AI and would it make a
film more or less interesting for you if
you do a computer and not a human wrote
it I don't I don't see that being an
issue anytime soon
outside of novelty I could absolutely
see like someone putting together like
you know the first movie written by a
computer but mostly it's just garbled e
Guk if it's if it's writing by
assembling you know bits and pieces of
others other authors work should the AG
got the credit or should every
screenwriter is cobbling from sharing
the screen credit well what was the big
deal recently Oh Oh artificial
intelligence
examined all known Harry Potter source
material yeah so all the books the play
and the fantastic beasts yeah and then
assembled one chapter of a new Harry
Potter book I'm assuming it sounds like
gobbledygook no it's actually pretty
good okay like it's I like some of it is
a little silly and some of it doesn't
make sense but if you ran that through
an editor they could fix it you know hmm
they could absolutely fix it some of it
was not that bad
ai is coming for all of us is the moral
of the story
annex some of the stuff we get with an
AI might be more interesting than the
stories that come out of you know actual
writers Xing take that take that
Hollywood
like I told the story I'm a you know a
little I told the story like a little a
little rushed but when when I was down
in the Bahamas my cousin had a drone
yeah and you know like that was cool
enough and drone technology is getting
to a point now where you can just do
some really neat things you know oh you
meant to talk about those but the most
impressive are so like yeah lying the
drone was so dumb like anyone could do
it but the really neat thing was as soon
as he landed the thing he could press
one button on his phone which was part
of the controller you plug your phone
into the controller and the app that
controlled the the drone used
information from like the accelerometer
the heights you know it can do a really
simple motion tracking to assemble a
30-second video to some awesome music
and so it was a decent video like we did
you do do do you know like it's all it's
drone footage so it's all like epic
Vista's anyway right right but the point
is it's artificial intelligence getting
you edited material and that's the
future that's that is absolutely the
future I could absolutely see myself
like I'm not a wedding photographer but
if I was a wedding videographer and I
use a drone footage to get some awesome
outdoor wedding shots yeah I could have
something to show the bride when she was
walking down the aisle yeah yeah they'd
go nuts for that mr. Dubbs no no no
they'd say why am I paying you because I
have the I have the I have to fly it I
still have to fire
Jack sounds really excited about someone
taking his job I'm excited about the
future and I'm comfortable enough in I'm
comfortable enough in what I do job wise
to not be replaced right away we're all
getting replaced eventually but I might
make it a little bit
Becky Gump plate says this has been the
worst month of my life and it keeps
getting worse every day
sorry I know you can't fix it but I had
to share my pain with someone PS I
turned into Eloise Cole kill me that's
the only way to stop a brief Club and
it's get them killed him before they
fully turn I did not know this rule yeah
about grief clowns
I guess if you wait until they turn and
kill them then they only get more
powerful sure a fucking boulder fell on
me I wasn't feeling that great about
Automation she can take us all telegin
says rich and Jack you see Andy Dick's
live meltdown on Twitch know like like
five percent about Andy Dick five
percent care about Andy Dick's meltdown
oh that's that's way more than a hoses
suspecting I was unsure Andy Dick was
still alive ups why is having a meltdown
Automation cannot replace my laughs oh
no they could they could finally laugh
and and they would they would try to
maximize its effectiveness were there
like you know if there's too much laugh
we've noticed a drop in fewer numbers
and so we need to make sure we maximize
enjoyment level to our viewers no no
court no breeches laugh automated
everything automated the algorithm
devours everything
the algorithm is acute social geometer
since been watching the content free for
years got a twitch account just so I
could give it to him and to once again
hear you say lol fuck my cock thank you
good to hear this dumbass says play
Final Fantasy not just kidding what do
you guys think of the MCU movies are
getting better or worse you're staying
the same under staying the same yeah
consistency isn't a bad thing I was
gonna say they started up pretty good
though right right and they've remained
pretty good you know I'm trying to think
of like any outliers you know where or
it's either been amazing or like
guardians hasn't quite been the same
formula
yeah kinda though like it's all part of
the same soup where they take an
outsider ish director and you know give
him the proper restrains and some proper
guidance and a budget
like that's that's that's jon favreau
all over with James Gunn
first two thorough movies were dogshit I
never saw Thor - oh really but first we
nowhere near as bad as I would have
expected a Thor movie it's just you know
it's just a Thor movie right just make
Thor somewhat likeable and interesting I
don't know I wasn't sitting there the
whole time thinking everything about
this is stupid all right that's fair
that's very as I would expect to an
authoritative normally that's a fair
that's that's fair criticism
great yeah and you know the dark world
it's fine it's it's it's not the dark
world seeing it a second time I saw it
before Ragnarok
it definitely wasn't as bad as I
remember it being the first time I saw
it
okay it's again it's just kind of a Thor
movie and it's it's I'm personal it's a
me problem
where it's like I just don't care about
any of these people here's a question
yeah should I watched or two before
eventually watching for three you still
haven't seen recognize no is that video
yet is that on Netflix that's a great
question I actually don't know yes I I
would say it is relatively important to
see Thor cube before you see right good
okay I kind of know about the ending is
that the only thing I'd really need to
know there's some there's some general
character stuff where it's it would do
you more good yeah it would do you more
good than bad to see it
just catch up on all bits
you
ketchup yeah yeah it might be worth it
to see
I almost leave still message good thank
you Lord Belmont says Lord Velma we did
address this at the beginning of the
street
sure what do you both think of
nintendo's libera
it's official Nintendo cardboard for
only $70 also do you guys know who mr.
MIT metalcore is no he's hilarious
he has mentioned liking aural I'm a few
times I just no idea we uh sorry about
that
but then it's under cardboard is silly
wait at first I thought well you know I
don't get it but it's probably gonna be
cheap but if it's not cheap I don't even
see the fucking point other than they
make a lot more money that way maybe
it's $70 for the game and the cardboard
you know but if it were priced you know
like cardboard
maybe they'd make up that money with
volume
I'm guessing it's gonna be like $70 for
the game and like that your starter
cardboard and a new cardboard will be
relatively cheap that's what I'm
assuming I have nothing to back up this
claim
it's literally for children yeah but $70
is a lot for cardboard it's a lot for
children
seventy dollars is a big ask like when
you're buying something for a kid
how long's car for the device
how long is that gonna last for let's
just shreds honey and then they need
more and they like the game they're
gonna cry for more once you have once
they have one card once you have one
card board it's easy to make more I hate
him more than where I think about it
yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna be okay
with it just because it's something
weird you know I like it when people I
like it when big established companies
do
for the sake of being weird yeah I don't
think it's for the sake of being weird I
think they're trying they're trying for
something if you're trying for some
they're trying to be they're trying to
we're trying to push the boundaries in a
big bad
do you get push it Nintendo ah push it
anonymous says hey guys I kind of sort
of flunked that interview that I
mentioned on Sunday sorry I'm still
looking but any advice on how to get
started in writing and or and streaming
and possibly earning money for well
helps if you have a pre-existing
successful YouTube presents that really
as far as how you get noticed there's no
you gotta just make good stuff there's
no there's no golden ticket it's just
make stuff until people notice be
interesting it to be good or interesting
I think to be a decent streamer
yeah and I mean as far as like writings
to all the the the only advice that
someone can give to someone in your
position which you might not find to be
very good advice is you just have to do
it start streaming start writing and see
what works
hopefully you're smart enough to know
what works
and know what fails and fail a little
bit and write a whole bunch of stuff man
you probably gonna be bad at first
oh you ever with anything you're gonna
be bad for a while like you're gonna be
bad for years you're gonna be you're
gonna be bad for a long time but that's
okay because if you keep doing it
eventually you'll get good that's for
everyone if you can endure years of
yourself being really shit at something
you know now that that might not be
great advice
but it's the best I got because that's
what I did that's what we all did it's
just it just kept doing things until we
learned until we learned what it was we
were doing in the first place
valiant bloodshot says rich rich are you
going are you going back to watch more
Star Trek discovery for the review of
season 1 or have you given up also is it
intentional that Mike always brings up
Star Trek and each best of the worst
episode it's well since it's become a
thing probably go he probably goes out
of his way to do it now but Mike does
just genuinely love Star Trek and it
comes up enough but I'm betting yeah
like if he sees an opportunity to make a
Star Trek reference he'll no longer keep
it in where he says no people like this
this is a running bit now I can just get
it he can get away with it now as far as
me and discovery I mean if if Mike wants
to talk about the second half of the
episode I'll probably just binge the
rest of it at some point but and that
I'm not chomping at the bit to watch
more Discovery there's a lot of sci-fi
shows I could watch right now that
aren't mediocre too bad some might have
characters I give a shit whether they
live or die careful now careful now
you're getting you're throwing out some
hotcakes
I read a spoiler about the second you
know they return for the second half of
discovery she's like yeah I didn't care
so what I don't care about any of the
characters on that show like any of them
yeah yeah yeah there's some good sci-fi
out there make sure you get yourself
some some expand I kind of hope this
ship blows up and they can replace them
with a different crew we had a walk Club
breach a whole crew then I'll do it in
the next episode but all those fucking
Klingons in the ship to get them all
fucking so you say you don't much care
for the show yeah basically taught you
know sometimes it's hard to read between
the lines with you
rich not even Tilly till he's fine
like I wouldn't watch a show about Tilly
she's a fine she's a fine background
character she the roommate yep
she's a fine background character right
sure no I got like I understand I get
what her role is contrast for that
sourpuss Michael right to comedic Lee
contrast with with with the big with
Debbie Downer my only my only issue with
that is like they know that that Michael
is or you know war criminal matter like
would they really give her a roommate is
that a is that a normal thing that would
happen in a universe it's the Star Trek
protagonist is a work right
and so then they're just like I don't
know sticker with the redhead like sir
are you I do fear for the safety of our
crew at all like no sticker with the
redhead it'll be fine
but I guess they can legally use words
like Starfleet Vulcan and Klingon so
it's Star Trek yep
yeah rich you gonna do what are you
gonna do about it man
that's trick at least rain is getting
work he's the best part about that show
and he was a guest character in two
episodes yeah he was a fine
wasn't my favorite Harry Mudd
it's a fans Star Trek show better we're
talking about Star Trek continues Star
Trek continues is fantastic
accent our accent are killed that goose
accident the shady fan project that
earned millions of dollars wouldn't
right how the fuck did they think they
could get ever get away with that right
did or do they care and then they ruin
fan films for everyone
it's also probably the reason this new
show is another prequel about the war
with the Klingons and then to fully
establish their control over that
concept you know you're probably know if
you want to know why this start the trek
doesn't take place in the future after
Voyager that's why because Axanar wanted
him into a Klingon word prequel like you
know now they have now now paramount or
CBA who are in the fuck it is now has to
establish dibs we own this we own this
and we're gonna show you how hard we own
this
yeah they should have just did what seth
macfarlane did and swap a couple of
words the fan film sure but then they
couldn't call it a Star Trek fan film
because that's what pays the bills yeah
well the funny thing is that was a fan X
and R was a fan film and the producers
of Discovery are clearly not Star Trek
fans
first I want and charge my Star Trek
show somebody who absolutely hates the
very concept of Star Trek you know
what's always bothered me about Star
Trek well let's fix this shitty show
it's that star - it's so gay I'm gonna
do it right
war tagging is could get into a sword
fight with the bad guy
but water-rich did you know there is a
war happening
mad prices Star Trek is about killing
gross aliens and banging green chicks
you fuckin are you know you know what is
the biggest myth ever the biggest pop
culture myth Kirk was never a womanizer
absolutely never
I mean put you understand
wait they occasionally gave him love
interest in episodes but that was cheesy
60s writing technically curtain didn't
womanize he just fell in love 12 times
throughout the three seasons of the show
haha I don't know I don't know I've
never heard of that Kirk who was a
womanizer
that's what people think no no because
you got that comedy is no Bing and green
chicks which never happened it's not a
right but that's not being a womanizer
people accuse him of being with a lot of
alien ladies okay which i think is fair
that's a fit that's a valid point Kirk
was with a fair share of alien ladies
really but really that was kind of
douche dick
Herc was not really a playoff a player
mm-hmm I mean how many though like and
not obviously he was he was enough of a
player where it became a thing yeah he's
not a womanizer Gino suave says he's
just easy he just you know spreading
humanity that's all
that's all he's just you know doing his
part his job
rich doesn't get sarcasm look whether or
not that comment was sarcasm and not
plenty of people do think think Kirk
just slept around constantly and had
one-night stands I mean that's why they
portrayed him that way in Star Trek 2009
right that's why they but that's the
character of Kirk Kirk kissed a lot of
ladies all right all right that's that's
a thing that's a thing that happened in
in the original Star Trek he kissed
himself a doozy of biddies no one's
denying the biddy Kissin
so you know get it from some where
everything comes from
wildlife industry says hey thanks for
playing spelunky I learned about the
game from your streams a long time ago
and it's been something my kid and I
have been into for over a year now
glad you enjoy
this never
just got updated gave to change this I
watched it
probably have to click on the ads yeah
whenever anyone punches
oh they stay they stay no they usually
just gotta pop oh no they went away
no they stay
where is our where's our chat site
methylate I mean what the fuck is going
on anonymous says I think you know I
think a lot of we kind of came into the
stream a little like man not a lot of
fun stuff to talk about right now an
anonymous says anonymous life's a piece
of shit that's how we're all feeling
anonymous when you look at it life's a
laugh and deaths a joke it's true you'll
see it's all a show keep them laughing
as you go just remember that the last
laugh is on you that from somebody's
from something that's definitely from
something you know what it's from and I
won't know it sounds vaguely Joker ish
it's based on content should be a little
joke yeah
I like it
Life of Brian okay okay that makes sense
it's still very Jewish
Dave reporter says hey guys
you have mentioned have we you have
mentioned
Anthony Q Mia on stream in the past I'm
aware of radio show with something else
something in Andy Amos and Andy now Opie
Opie and Anthony Oh
are you familiar with this network and
compound Mediacom
he loves rlm stuff I'm not sorry it's
something personal against him
it's nothing personal against them but
no I'm not I'm not I have no idea what
it is you speaker
in fact I don't know if I've even ever
like listened to any of his
again nothing personal I just don't
listen to a lot of radio
Jack and rich Don anyone on it well
technically he's from radio yeah we
don't know anyone from anything man you
don't know we don't know shit
we see this we don't know nothing
no no we're caught up oh well that's
great I think they realized we're
playing that weird goofy physics game
really reading tips so we got up we
should make you found some sort of
compass
I found a compass I'll fuck yeah I found
a compass I have a pickaxe I have a
jetpack and I have the eye of udjat
she's a real thing in the game rich and
I wish you would take it more seriously
it sounds like an alien name I would
have made up for gorilla interrupted hi
every job John
yes this is the eye of ujat
oh fuck off you giant spider I I was
pausing to to make a plan and the spider
killed me
it's pausing for just a moment to be
like okay here's what I can do here's
what I can do and the spider killed me I
want to get out of the mines tonight
like that's my only goal it's gonna
while since I played spelunky so I'm a
little rusty but at very least like to
get out of the mines this
what's your favorite Joker quote no I
don't really I don't really have any
memorized do you you ever memorized a
joker quote the Joker
joy the Joker is a character in right
accordingly mark Campbell's performance
of hamon Batman the Animated Series but
that is as far as I go with my love of
the Joker and whoever said that that's
gonna put you on a list you do that's
gonna put you right on a list you ever
dance with the devil by the pale
moonlight yeah I remember that one but
that certainly wouldn't make any kind of
favourites list if I had one that might
be one of the dummer Joker quotes in
fact doesn't doesn't Jack Nicholson in
the movie say like I just like that
sounded yeah like he like that quote
doesn't mean anything yeah probably some
of my favorite quotes would be from the
Nolan movie you know my mother always
said if you're good at something always
charge or never do it for free yeah yeah
like that's cute
that's a cute Joker line
and yet I remember that quote vividly
well it was a plot point never Jerry
that's slow-mo memory of the version
yeah you guys looking forward to seeing
how season 3 of ash vs. Evil Dead and
turns out I'll watch it when it's out
looking for I like I don't know what to
look forward to I really don't know much
about what they're going to do with the
season yeah and I actually don't know if
I am looking forward to it you know I
don't like I I don't know if I'll get a
Showtime subscription or stars or
whatever it is like just for that item
number if there's anything else on Starz
they're giving him a daughter but it's
not gonna be telling which gonna fit so
long I would have given her a reason to
stick around well that's right that's
what they were going to do oh yeah you
told me about that that makes me upset
that would have been great you know
stick with the characters we've known
and grown and low fuck it we're adding a
new actress reading a new actress our
numbers tell us that she has a great
replay value on YouTube clips you can't
on Kelly though yeah but it's a comedy
that just makes you Greek here nicely
probably funnier all right
Luke was macking on Leia before they her
brother and sister that's a thing thank
you can you just make a joke about it in
the show right I was gonna say with ash
it works even better he'd hit on his own
daughter
that's so ash
paedon kendo says other aspects of the
Mad Max game that you like more than the
Batman Arkham series absolutely not
which game does their source material
the most justice like by I don't know
the an insane amount of distance between
them the the clearer and obvious answer
to that is the Arkham games which game
is more fun overall the Batman Arkham
games okay I've enjoyed the Mad Max game
I gotta admit though if it didn't have
the Mad Max branding yeah that that
would take away a chunk of it sometimes
that's important yeah yeah it's really
important you know what I was thinking I
can admit that you know what I was
thinking about that with recently is I
downloaded some I was playing some some
fighting games
they were
oh that's up the rivals of ether rivals
of aether
you guys know what I'm talking about in
chat rich wouldn't know the the rivals
of aether and brawl holonomic brawlhalla
what's what's the new one it just came
to the switch and it has like a frog on
the cover brawl does anyone know what
I'm talking about no no one knows what
I'm talking about yes I just sacrificed
the dog it's a dog there's a dog and I
had enough I had enough hearts and I
wanted to get a treat Battletoads brawl
holla yes they're both Smash Brothers
clones okay so they play exactly the
same as Super Smash Brothers but they
own they each have their own unique
characters and actually the only reason
I wanted brawlhalla is because uh
the Marriot the the wrestler from
guacamelee is a playable character and i
was like yeah i want to play a fighting
game with him that'd be fun and both
mechanic wise play really nice like
they're very smooth fighters good
controls but it's not curvy beating the
shit out of Mario so I just don't kind
of care you know like that level of
familiarity with the characters adds a
whole lot to a property you didn't play
that much of the argument you somebody
in the chat sang it the same would be
true for the Arkham games and I'm gonna
say no I'm gonna say those would be good
games regardless I mean they're they're
clearly written from the ground up to be
Batman experience spud
right
you you could make them just generic
characters changed a little bit around
here and there are story wise I still I
still say the Arkham games would be fun
games you know I've apparently I'm close
to the end of asylum yeah I cuz I'm at
the ivy yeah stage and uh according to I
haven't finished it huh I thought you
just stopped I played it a little on
stream afterwards okay I have no I don't
really like care to finish it like I and
that's not true I kind of want to finish
it but you know there's usually other
stuff to play yeah
there's always stuff to play
mother fucker is fuckin
so anyway you near the IV section and
and I've heard that that is near via
yeah so would it make and you know I
haven't played Arkham City but I play
dark of night and you know as everybody
knows City has a considerably better or
open world when it comes to improving
the gameplay and improving the game
experience yeah City is is the tits
story-wise it's a little bit more
muddled okay it loses it loses its focus
about a quarter of the way through and
in this story that isn't supposed to be
about the Joker you spend an awful lot
of time on this Joker side quest gotcha
gotcha hmm yeah maybe we'll give that a
shot I like the game I like the
mechanics I like the I like the fightin
yeah I like the detectiving some of the
detectiving some of the detective
anything but Arkham City is 400 damn
little row fees
all of them are optional that's only a
problem if you want to be a
completionist and I will admit yeah it's
an obnoxious number of little trophies
and great
mr. freeze fright is worth the purchase
alone at my face oh yeah there's a
wonderful stealth boss fight and in city
cool visit there's a stealth battle with
mr. freeze but the gimmick is see mr.
freeze learners so if you like you do
the the takedown where you pop through
the vent then mr. freeze freezes all the
vents so you can't you can't do the same
type of stuff
takedown twice see you have to mix it up
nice it's the best moment the fucking
game
yeah yeah Arkham City does also make the
penguin interesting oh that's a rare
feat yeah it's possibly the best take on
the penguin really yeah it is a rare
feat
Danny DeVito penguin best I use a little
bit too much of a monster
you're 14 you are
you know the secret shop is around here
somewhere but I couldn't find the secret
shop I couldn't find it he was there I'm
sorry jack I got out sorry but I wanted
that secret shop no black market for me
I know and I was close I was close to
fifty thousand I could have gotten the
thing and we could have gone on a little
adventure I underestimated that your
spelunky skills and I said you were
fucked I'm pretty good no better I'm
pretty good at that you're a spelunky
bet I had to use both of my ropes yeah
it's gonna take it's gonna take a lot
more than just a little ghosts
my Master's moral question if you
suddenly gain the superpower of turning
yourself invisible for as long as you
want
would you tell anyone there's a 50%
chance I'm asking me because I'm
standing right behind you yeah you know
you're awful thin we're by a wall yeah
you know unless you're in that corner
yes that's the side of us yeah
oh no I would not tell how you do with
the power of visibility what do you do
with that become the world's greatest
private detective you could find out
anything you want it you wanted to know
right yeah and so could you
huh could you okay we still have to get
into the computer system to hack it Jack
you'd be better off being the world's
best hacker if you want to be the
world's best private detective
okay it's not hacking shit okay here's
my here's here's the important probably
real private detector yeah the the
ability to turn invisible what's what's
the closed situation
let's make it as convenient for you as
possible you can wear whatever the fuck
you want okay here the court the
question is could I hide a camera within
the invisibility okay okay that's what
you're saying the camera okay the camera
won't work while you're invisible
what I like it because the lights the
light is gonna go through the camera you
know you're not hit the lens properly
I'm not hit my lens properly you're
asking your eyes shouldn't work either
but we're gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hand
wave that magic or what about you no
that's fair I like it rich I like those
are those are some good stipulations I
can get behind that oh shit how do I do
the ghost get here women women's locker
room look we live in an era where the
Internet is the thing you don't need to
sneak into a woman's locker room to see
boobies there there are ladies on the
internet that posts naked pictures of
themselves just for fun hey this is
crazy time we're living in here's my
boobies like you don't need locker rooms
anymore no you know the women are doing
in the locker room what putting on their
clothes as unsexual E as possible right
there there are there are actresses out
there who specialize in turning you on
friend and you want you wanted like like
some ladies being like man I got a weird
rash down here you want to see my rash
yeah I'm gonna say the women's locker
room would be the most the biggest
letdown of all time oh my god yes the
woman's locker room as and like as a kid
I'm with you when I was a teenager that
was all I thought about but as an adults
you just know like it's just a bunch of
people going like no one's starting a
makeout party woman's like right right
but so what what my thought is
invisibility was
here's here's my here's my here's how I
could use this to my advantage
yeah I could obtain damning footage of
people talking when they don't think
anyone's around okay for ya blackmail
purposes or or just straight-up
detective work or it's like could you
just straight up do this by just heading
microphones cuz they'll see you man
right leg or well you kind of have to be
quiet - yeah you'd have to be quiet
how does invisibility affect your
Sativex sound it shouldn't I guess it
shouldn't yeah but like you know let's
say let's say you're it let's say
there's an office building right I'm
like oh I go we got a we got to get the
the president of the bank because he's
embezzling money but we need proof we
need proof that he's embezzling money
and so like you know sneak in there cuz
I'm all invisible put some cameras I
don't know it was above spitballing here
rich I'm spitballing homeless is going
to do is just make it easier to install
the cameras that's all it's going to do
for you yeah it's not like all right as
you know you're invisible you walk into
the bank manager's office it's not like
at that perfect moment that you walk in
he's gonna start talking about his
embezzling to somebody right you're
gonna be sitting around for days yeah
yeah when we pick up some laundry I put
this wagon home oh yeah drop it off hang
up
oh that's gonna be most of but I think
that's most detective work be so fucking
boring to be the Invisible Man
detective incredibly boring what else do
you do with things visible
in fact it would be a great Saturday
Night Live sketch the detective walk you
know walks in the mirror goes finally
I'm gonna catch this cheating husband
and then it's just like five minutes of
the husband doing really mundane things
while the invisible guys nothing yeah I
guess here's here's what I'm saying what
else do you do with invisibility powers
besides sneaking around and how can you
properly monetize sneaking around
what's your what's your plan I don't I
don't have one okay I'm not I'm not I'm
not sure it's the best power to have oh
it's not just the power you have okay if
I no means the best power it's just it's
you know it's what we got you know it's
what we're stuck with and they want to
know if you would tell anyone if you
would keep it secret of course keep it
secret got ahold got ahold of thought
you got hold that shit close to the
chest you know standard superhero rules
protecting those around you protecting
your own identity yeah yeah pretty
standard but yeah right wait wait wait
okay now if you're invisible take a shit
is the shit invisible because you just
you just go into the office of someone
you don't like and you take an invisible
shit on their desk and they'll never be
able to get rid of it I know this
constantly be wondering what that smell
is
guys seriously what is that smell why
does my office smell like shit like all
the time guys it's like all the time it
just smells like shit
that's pretty good I like that
rub it all over someone's clothes
right
you can follow your nose to find the
source of the invisible stench yeah but
if it's like smeared all over and you
can't see it it's just gonna be warmly
confusing gear right I like that I like
the invisible stench your spirit and a
fairly inaccessible spot they're never
gonna think to clean their like yeah
like just to smear some shit in like
Viet Lee the corner of the room if it's
invisible they'll never know it's fair
that's that's totally fair I don't know
like the question is you know if you're
invisible if you're powered like you're
not super strong you're not super fast
the only power is you you turn yeah
invisible yeah how can you profit from
this that's what I want to know I don't
know and so for me it's like well you
profit by being sneaky mm-hmm and you
know yeah you be you be a source for an
investigative journalists we're like we
need evidence for the story I'm right
now give you a big cash all right okay I
can do that you sell you sell your your
dirty footage to TMZ or whatever like
yeah oh look at the dirty footage a gun
right even you can find yourself a
partner and just be a horrible
fraudulent medium whoo levitate the
table with the power of the spirits I
like it now I can levitate that back is
you back to it okay
the vase is floating around the room
someone's really angry with you
yeah
c'mere lady
there we go there we going lady you
goody two-shoes are not thinking like a
supervillain you're presuming I want to
break long right
and you know the way the way banks
handle their money there's just like
there's not a lot of good ways to steal
cash you know you still leave behind DNA
evidence you don't know yeah right like
where there's a lot of work but even
assuming you could steal cash like
eventually you'd hit a point where you
wouldn't want to like be the guy who
only has cash and pays for his rent in
cash like they'll find you there's
there's trails man you could impregnate
someone and claim it's a virgin birth so
you get the power invisibility and your
first thought is you rape someone no and
and you think they're not gonna feel
that come on man maybe that person
which is calling you out for a tiny dick
I don't know - the thing you need to go
to do we change the game and machete
yeah okay yeah someone's saying this
doesn't look like you and falls flat
refresh your page we played it for three
hours yes it was white photos fine fun
little game fun little game chat was
getting bored
we weren't talking very much I had had
enough at that point but matter now I
hate this game way just enough I've been
playing enough money to bring us yeah
he's done them I started doing this and
I think that's fine so yeah I'm
basically like to wrap up in powers of
invisibility talk I think that the best
way to profit is blackmailing people
okay is using your powers to blackmail
fees so is there any good way to you are
here's a question is there any good way
to use invisibility profitable reason
for way that isn't a breaking ball
what do you can you prop it off of your
invisibility without breaking the wall
Breaking and Entering spying on people
blackmailing people oh sure I guess
private detective but you're still
breaking in that yeah that's kind of a
legal grave yeah sure ah that's a fair
question or is the very essence of
invisibility one you know one that kind
of invites that kind of uh via
government agent they take a look at
using can you hack things I could turn
invisible no to see me coming you just
hack their computers though and that's
really that's really what we need to do
but do you like they speak the languages
do you speak Iranian or Russian or like
what what good are you to us I can't
turn invisible we need more than that
three years Spanish minimum magician's
assistant so you can use your special
power to do something that stage
magicians already know how to do through
sleight of hand that's it that's the
best you can do I'll be your assistant I
can make myself disappear
and then magicians go there like I do
that every night and like I spent all
this money on the special cabinet I mean
it's kind of a waste you want me to get
rid of the cabinet I don't understand
what you're saying because I have a
cabin got all the smoke I got all these
mirrors and I know how to use them
correctly yeah there just might not be a
lot of opportunities for your invisible
hero really just invisible person you
know trying to make trying to make a
living maybe maybe that's why invisible
invisible hero people go to life's of
crime so often
that was dumb I don't like the spring
shoes Tiberius Kirk it throws him a jump
off the spring shoes throw my jump off
and I don't like see that's what I'm
saying dis T I'm saying you're looking
to be a journalist or some sort of
private detective where you can use your
invisibility powers a moral gray area to
eavesdrop on people and you can get some
people to say stuff in your presence
that they normally wouldn't and that
would be you know hugely beneficial to
your career of course
morally great legally grey
but you could you could know a lot of
things if you were invisible and in the
right place to hear the thing right
theoretically
so I don't know that's that's to me
that's my that's my oh man that's my
only place to go with it but hey but hey
some jewels
anima Sons hey dude bro hey bro dude in
3.5 hours yep
Dragonball fighter Z beta is back for 24
hours staying up for that who will be
your Dragon Ball fighter man Goku Vegeta
probably for China
we met in resumable pool no I'm not
staying up for that
good that must see
anything not machine dog
gosh dang it but hey if that's if that's
your thing
congratulations on you know finding the
thing I have a thing that you like
that's great
petal affects all the things that your
life
and shad says I was invisible yep I
would track down Neil Breen and pretend
I'm God telling him he's the chosen he
already thinks that you just be wasting
your time right if you like you just
told me that yeah I know we had this
conversation we had this conversation
for a change
beautiful I know God stop telling me I'm
trying to delivering a message to the to
your people like you told me to
it's harder than I thought god I'll do
my best
did you do Bill Murray's Groundhog Day
of you what I'm not sure in like what I
make the movie if I could I wouldn't
have to it already exists if you mean
what I want to go through that
experience and actuality will he'll know
have you seen the movie yeah it sounds
miserable I think a lot of people don't
get groundhogs day
yeah that he's basically in hell he's
basically in hell and and the the other
thing that that I always found really
beautiful about groundhogs they you know
he you know basically he only gets out
of the cycle after he uses his day to
its fullest yeah and what's really fun
or really funny to me is you know like
he has all this time and so he learns
how to like play piano and doom and do
do stuff which is like these are all
skills that any one of us could obtain
at any time
by doing the same thing you just go do
lessons every day that's it it's like
there's no extra there's no extra magic
with a with a Groundhog's Day situation
it's just he did the work you know I'm
so fucked
you could kill without consequences
would you really want to seriously
seriously
even if you know that at the time would
repeat would you would you feel good
about stabbing somebody in the chest I
mean right what kind of person is you
exactly
nice we got the black market we have the
black market oh and I got cash too
okay we got we got the makings if I can
find a damsel
or at this point I just say fuck it
because I'm so close
I feel like we found out a lot about you
viewers from this question right did
rich and I want to know all this by you
guys
fog that we're getting out of here Oh
your secret shop
yep I'm in the secret shop and I have
enough money to get the UNK well we're
gonna we're trying for we're trying to
beat the game for realsies okay so
here's the ankh which is a super weapon
which in playing the game normally just
grants us a bonus life which you never
ever get but when you're going for the
super secret ending you need to die on a
specific level don't have any hearts and
I don't have any good equipment and I
don't have any money all right
buy any good equipment so basically I'm
almost hoping for death at this point
because then I get more hearts but we're
gonna we're going for secrets here we're
going
the best I can hope for is some secrets
yeah what if what if that movie just
went on a little bit longer and it
turned out that day was repeating the
second day second day then starts
repeating for a thousand years and his
entire life was gonna be like that just
every day as a thousand every day every
thousand years he gets to he gets to go
ahead one day oh my god that would be so
depressing especially after he starts
feeling like it all cancer pain he's
just an old man and he had a
particularly bad day
on the cancer meds huh yeah that'll
fucker right there
bridges a man yes I am yeah figure do
you knew that about right
please this ABS this guy my my new
friend yeah
in the game you unlock characters and
now he's a helper okay
and so helpers aren't actually very
helpful in the game maybe he'll go
around and and like kill guys for me or
like pick up treasure for me like
usually they end up doing stuff you
don't want them to do yeah but he's also
just said like a new character we unlock
so okay you know all the shit unlocked
for this game let's uh this is yours oh
that makes sense so I'm just going
around but like yeah help me a helper
heat and he might be helping he might
help at some point but
mostly the helpers do not see you look
you just died on a spike back that's how
much to help yourself
they die in spite this this seemed
completely useless yeah they kind of are
why would you ever want one
I usually don't they're there but just
getting doing not terrible
and officially calling this not terrible
know that the only other way to get help
of the met buying it
yeah you can you can there's a little
like prostitution damsel shops every
once in awhile that will sell you kisses
for hurts how many hearts are you
comfortable
what's a good number of nice for for is
good like anything that'll protect you
from a fall or an arrow like yeah
anything over to I am I'm hugely pretty
comfortable with just because so the
camp like Super Mario Brothers she do
the slow fall yeah cute cute yes
very very helpful well that pre lives
now yeah for lives how long would it
take you to try one more
oh well you know we'll just see how far
we can get on this one still okay like
this run is in loss I do we just won't
get the secrets now you know which is a
chance to find another Punk no
unfortunately get in the door
unfortunately Matt oh and we were right
there too if the if the if the the
secret thing is right in this first area
I'm gonna be so pissed if I was like one
door away
thank you for just died of something
else anyway you had one heart Oh exactly
I know it was a it was a pipe dream to
begin with
you guys are forced to go for the
groundhog day got to pick the day you
have any particular choice did you
realize no matter what day you pick
eventually it's going to be utter human
misery no matter what game you pick or
what day you pick right Oh even if it's
the most magical day mm-hmm
you know I had a pretty decent wedding
day we had a great time but every day
yeah if that's every day at some point
you'd have to start calling off your
wedding at this time just to have a
moment's fucking peace your mornings for
years would start off with calling Lisa
and having her cry on the other end of
the phone just because I couldn't take
it you couldn't take the constant
weddings the point is no matter what no
matter what every day like you know like
the one day that you just spent all day
like you know reading books at the beach
oh what a calm and great day but you
know what well if there's no more books
on that island and that's the groundhogs
day and you run out of books now swim at
the beach you the moral of groundhogs
days you've run out of shit to do
I mean if I did have to choose a day it
might be my wedding day though like that
was a very nice day you know it was good
time it that almost ended disastrously
that was a nice day my wedding
he spent vo spent the the morning really
relaxed with my groomsmen we've got a
nice brunch it'd be hell it'd be held
for a girl to do their wedding day over
and over and over again because there's
a lot of work involved a lot of to do in
don't need money
at the same time I could have that well
I think of an edge of tomorrow oh I
really liked edge of tomorrow that was
good that was a Tom Cruise kind of
Groundhog Day action movie yeah that was
a lot of fun that was like shockingly a
really solid movie oh here it is see
that thing
this is the level so for those those who
are paying attention one and all those
foreign key secrets if you have the ankh
with you and died on this level you you
resurrect inside this guy's head and
that's what takes you to the secret
levels so I wasn't right there I wasn't
that that's how you get the true ending
that's how you get the true end oh
there's the plot of this game is
officially the groundhog day isn't it of
this day those game no that's true that
is actually very true you keep you keep
well you know it's Groundhog's Day but
then every day is a little different
it's a little Groundhog Day
who aliens all right we can deal with
some areas
this is stage lead how many regular
stadium for how many secret stages over
several there's and there's alternate
stages too so you know there's there's
the shop there's the worm
there's the alien stage there's the city
of gold there's hell and neither of
these cover the two boss battles which I
need to actually start thinking about
the boss battles have a what is this
game
cuz he made the game he wanted to make
right off the benches been made actually
this game is kind of the sequel I've
heard this this is you know cuz this is
uh this is basically an HD remake of a
very popular freeware game this is an HD
remake of you know spelunky classic what
is known as blanca classic now that
derek you made with some people and
became really infamous on the freeware
market and as soon as what was a braid
as soon as braid went really big xbox in
the Xbox 360 indie market was looking
for more shit they needed another game
and and so he started working on this
all right temple like I have no idea
what that is
down there in the lava what is that
I've never seen that before you've never
seen that before
it's been a while since I played
see if we gonna freakin like figure out
what that is what is that operator for
grass operator can you can you throw the
grasshoppers that will definitely work
yes you can progress out can you do the
Mario Cape spin and stun the grasshopper
not taking our gold heads no there's too
much shit happening and I just got a
move at this point there's just too much
shit happening
you just have to be concerned with
yeah hmm and I have no bombs
in the prayers it clearly does that mean
what does that mean that made you here
the present version please I'd say that
was fairly okay so like see that thing
yeah that little golden door is the door
to the Golden City which is you know the
thing you need part of part of the thing
you need to get into hell but but if you
go in the ox head thing how do you get
back yeah we have bigger problems to the
others right now we have a murder
we have a murder ball or a murder cube
situation thank you that just saved
their ass right there that just saved
our ass rich we might beat the game we
might be the game now good good you know
they either the easy beats not not the
full beats not not the not to super be
the mummy the mummy is the problem what
is the problem can you blow up I can
blow up the mummy but I can also just
ignore the mummy
I'm a freak
what what
what I don't know what happened I wasn't
paying attention
god damn it I wasn't paying attention
all right I got two hearts it'll be fine
it'll be fine it'll be fine
I'm panicking I am I'm a hundred percent
panicking all right is this it this
might be Olmec this is this is Olmec any
movie made after 2010 you think you
remembered 30 years from now as a
classic
I answered everything fair and
correcting today
get up there
really use like a climbing blow
Jetpack right about now jetpack would
sure be nice
village but some helpful at home at the
Cape and that's ok bombs are good
you stay over there what I didn't need
that I didn't need that here's the super
cheater way to defeat Olmec I hope I
have enough bombs he's over there he
doesn't seem he only moves towards you
when when you're close
just make you make your own path from ik
so normally what you do is you have to
wait until like he gets ya over you and
smashes down but if you have enough
bombs make your own path and then make
them fall in the hole is that easy it
ain't easy being cheesy Oh Chester
Oh Chester
did you fuck yourself no I did not
okay
a few light enough
okay whoa whoa I almost fucked myself to
death yeah
there we go cheese and motherfucker but
I beat him but I beat him that's that's
the way you cheese only you get enough
bombs I don't forget I made it through
the fucking t-shirt sure I made it I'm
not faulting you
I didn't
perfectly reasonable way to win I think
so
I think it's a perfectly reasonable way
to win I mean if you have the bombs you
want upstream before I don't know
actually
okay I don't know congratulations thank
you thank you everybody
little Jack pattern you know not migrate
that just shows you by the way how many
hours I have into this game where I
could just pick it up at any point just
go I just make it like I forget a lot
there's a lot of intricacies that I
forget but yeah we can just make it no
uh no jetpack no climbing gloves I think
Derek I think Derek is working on a new
game now anyone who loves this game make
sure you you read the the book the
making of spelunky I think it's just
called spelunky written actually by
Derek you it's a fantastic book on where
all of his where he got all of his ideas
for the game all of his references like
basically his entire creative process in
playings below me is in the book that he
wrote about it's like it's great okay
watch all the things
rich enjoyed that perfectly acceptable
cheese sandwich good job jack
are you talking about my my spinning the
Dead Rising boss today a win is a win a
win is a win over France over the
Maelstrom the music
you've overly overly mastered them is it
getting to the point where you can no
longer enjoy it but the timer is no
longer no problem
sure I've I've got I've got to good
around through the game now there's one
spot right where I kind of cut it close
for a case file but other than that well
so does that diminish your enjoyment
area like why is the finally was like a
puzzle for fun just figuring that right
fun was figuring out how to do all the
things right so but you everything I
solved the puzzle just don't look at
puzzle yeah right and you still have
your things that gonna join in the game
you want yeah that's all about Jack want
some wine with all that cheese I'll take
it
that's the wind but but remember like
when you play spelunky that right there
that's just a start like that you're
just putting a tiny crack in the egg
like me blossoms into a flower it's not
a chicken at all yeah I got you I like I
remember the first time I beats bowling
with you and then just like finding out
that there's so much more like what
about that one thing in that one area
hole is that all about and just um
unwrapping each layer of it maybe I you
know there's an achievement for if you
beat spelunky in under ten minutes and
then just telling myself there's no
fucking way I can beat this game
do it boom getting over a million
dollars while you after you know while
you beat the game there's no way you can
do that then you do it
Yeah right fucking great turn record
