[Part I]
yet maybe hit the start stream I hit
this now we're streaming hello wait wait
wait wait
now hello you know over time I'm not
doing it because I know you're fucking
with me no it's true
hello everybody welcome welcome to
Wednesday it's Wednesday
hold on I'm tweeting what time Mr seven
it is seven thirteen so we're 13 minutes
late
okay I said we're gonna start around 7
and the Keisei around well it's always
ish yeah I always we always started ish
affordable so I have no idea what the
fuck assist space adventures so you're
gonna have to describe this game thing
for game I and I have never played it
oh I'm - I'm tweeting all right did you
get the tweet ready before you have
starts free magic nope this is all part
of it it's all part of it you guys keep
stacking it yeah we started it oh no
video that's weird
do you yeah you guys hear us but don't
see a video that's weird
hold on I'm gonna check on this alright

longest tweet the entire world which is
strange because you only get so many
characters it takes me if there's like
12 characters it takes me a while you
know what it takes me a while
takes me um all the tweet I can't help
it
check tweets like I walk that bad are
you guys see oh oh it's okay okay great
every refresh everybody we should be
streaming everything should be fine so
here is how affordable space affordable
hears that was pitch to me is it's it's
a spaceship game and one person has to
control stuff like the engines and like
be the captain and the other person gets
to control things like the guns and
other stuff and then you have to work
together to like allocate power to
different things while the other person
shoots the gun and stuff okay that's how
it was pitched to me I have not played
it I am excited
I've already sent the tweet Lucky
Strikes
so how about you settle down
and now I'm just making sure that we're
streaming because people seem to Jack
has been staring at his phone since we
started screaming people seem to have
but yeah okay we are streaming and just
watching the stream right now great all
right
greatest video everything's great Wow
there's a video there is video okay
everything's great
all the things are great so let's rich
you would do you want a wrist strap for
your Wiimote or no wrist strap no wrist
wrap no we're fine you know I don't know
I'd be able to use this from the floor
I'm I'm I'm really hoping there you go
you know what rich I'm really hoping a
it's not starting much no I'm starting
the journey you you're just you're you
get that and I get this journey one
start a new journey ease Trier somewhat
inclusive tourist exploration technical
you want to go technical right that mmm
tourist might be like one person focus I
don't I don't know I join up bridge oh
yeah oh yeah oh good I did bring I
brought the thing
here's the thing plug it in alright well
I get to do the engineer and you get to
be the pilot okay
Oh bother says can you guys just fuck
with the sound a bit to make us feel at
home I mean it's fine right now but just
fuck yeah I'm giddy okay now you have to
hit 80 doing every dip okay great now
you've joined somehow I unjoined oh and
we could have a third player as the
Navigator we don't have a third player
I'm just saying we could oh my god okay
my crew is assembled please adjust the
slider to the darkest possible setting
it's fine it's fine it's four great
that's fine that's great
okay turn then you know some sort Oh oh
my god this is not gonna work turn and
I'm sitting that's right you're playing
c'mon remember to communicate with each
other the game will at one point display
post for me versts
so at one specific point enhance the
game experience by showing post from
either stealing through naval online
features no no I'm sorry I don't want my
game enhanced DeeAnn stuffing a bunch of
crap pop up on the screen weird weird
stupid world breaking things that people
say it's the same with blood-borne and
Dark Souls I don't know how people can
deal with those ghosts pop enough basics
yeah this beautiful world on a bunch of
messages around snow my ass adorable
that spaceship is spectacular
yes jack is fully caffeinated I just
finished a very large coffee and I'm
pretty excited about that so I'm very
excited and happy to be here you know
how do how do you get me to watch a
cutscene give it a delightful British
narration story this is delightful a
checkers guide to the galaxy vaguely
very vaguely just because this is a
British accent
for no other reason I a doughnut says
first the audio is fine and now Jack is
watching a cutscene what the fuck is
going on right the pod people have
invaded and they're more confident so
you should be glad I'm Agha vengers I do
like the Dyson commercials we've
configured our vacuum cleaners to never
lose section of rent to my small craft
is a date don't like to fake add yeah
yeah it's a fun way to do checks plural
checks floor all right are we ready to
Jack's floor yeah I have no idea what
I'm doing but I'm ready to do it we're
ready to do it rich we're gonna go on a
Dora believe enter Oh bother I mean the
Dyson guys a little much especially his
like his blade thing if you've ever used
the Dyson blade in a bathroom it saver
places the hand blower the Dyson blade
is just like we've revolutionized how to
draw your hands it's a revolution it
reminds we have an e3 video there it's
all always a revolution
okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
oh and for some reason
all right thing on the screen I don't
know I'm not doing anything do you need
to power an engine oh it's starting it's
starting on my own you know what we
don't have my screen isn't on so you
guys just get to see what's happening on
the main screen those are a lot
happening on your screen there's stuff
happening on my screen how much is
happening you know let's see here the
small craft scanner system is equipped
with a flashlight to illuminate the
world around you
tap the system to enable and disable it
aim with the right stick okay ready
enable okay and then I get to like a
look around and shit okay
all right this is my job okay great
that's great and I could turn it off
oh whoa the small craft fuel engine is
the basic engine the vessel is equipped
with tap fuel engine to start and stop
the engine and steer
oh my god Jack what are you honking the
horn honking horn get out of here wait
how do I steer that you oh that's me ah
how'd it go up and down and shit oh my
god oh oh you know what I can't turn the
light on
oh my god this is deep so I'm running
the lights and rich is steering the ship
oh no we crashed rich what we crashed
look we're I don't know we didn't crash
yeah look oh the container is carrying
us crashed is what I'm saying
Oh with that oh no rich what are we
gonna do we're gonna explore yeah mother
fucker
oh go in there can you go oh where where
where can you go in there
yeah well the things falling out yeah
that's probably sitting on there Oh oh
my god look at my life fix it you're the
fucking engineer Oh small crabs hit by
lightning the small craft was hit by
lightning from an electromagnetic storm
all the systems turned off alright I
just turned the engine back on
and the scanner Becca what is long I
don't know what I want to pick that up
nope it's on a different plane of
existence stop honking horn I want the
shit alright trailer we can't go too
high okay it's powering up okay ready
engines on scanner on stand low Richard
Edlund Evans you have a beautiful
singing voice I did I got jumps whoa can
we can we grab it nice nothing nothing
I'm tell you creepy
we did it that was all hey I feel really
great about this you want rich to honk
the horn mark
okay oh sorry I need to hit continue
yeah about this okay all right
kind of looks like we're inside of a
giant human no I'm just saying
those look like veins blue some people
seem like okay they're ceiling up there
and there's floor down here back here
this one feeling like a wallet hard to
tell what's a wallet out yeah kind of -
okay like what the light bounces up whoa
yeah like - that one
fuck you know this this definitely
reminds me of like uh oh it's the movie
with Martin Short inner space inner
space yeah highly underrated movie love
fucking love inner space oh this needs
like an inner space mod well hey it's a
fucking floor
I wonder what the Navigator would do
they might they have a map to look at I
don't know
well the Navigator gets another Wiimote
so so I have the gamepad and I've is
like a screen like a very FTL like
screen the only thing I can do is turn
on the engine and turn on the scanner at
the moment I'm never gonna might handle
like a flashlight maybe and rich has
rich has a Wiimote and Nunchuk pointing
has done nothing so far but cuz because
I'm on the floor and it's not working
right
maybe pointing I think pointing you get
later when a maybe a gun happens okay is
what I can only assume will there's
gotta be more for you to do Oh tonight
oh no that's still a thing it's still or
bet well well they're obviously dead
nobody know this is a great engine ready
and no I think that fall and the flippin
nah yeah we got an inertial dampeners so
you say oh wait there's some down here
it's too obvious so fuckin box probably
not the way yeah all right
are you honking for your friends
I'll keep your hearty
that's a bumper sticker I just hope
something happens Simon you know this is
just teaching us the ropes
yep see like there's an obstacle so now
we learn that we can push things great
oh wait wait wait what I wanna think
something that is repaired Oh
fuel thruster the fuel thruster systems
lets you configure the speed and force
of the small craft tap the thruster to
change its system power so now we are at
full thruster what holy fuck
hold on hold on going down coming back
then oh shit shit what happened
hello I tried to push the thing and that
way blew up it burned out small craft
overheated the small craft overheated
due to internal overload and got
destroyed then you didn't tell me about
these things Jack why did I'm just a
pilot here I'm going back to - okay I'm
back to - thrust now we didn't need this
for anything apparently not okay
get back to scan in here
I know if we need more thrust okay need
more one more thrust nope okay one more
thrust more now okay okay oh I oh I see
the oh wait go down go down stop stop I
turned off all thrusters we were all we
have a felt we were over it we were
overheating yes oh no I had a little
thing on my screen I saw the pride the
overheat progress bar wait was there
anything else up there
oh well it's not now oh you know what
and uh leftover beep cake your your
switch thing isn't working right now so
I see a fruit pie the magician thank you
for subscribing we very much appreciate
it it's not working it's not working
right now hold on turn it back on see
it's working now
there we go
now it's working sometimes it's all you
got to do is turn it off turn it back on
again whoa easy now
there's only shadows explore check this
like radar
oh yeah that's kind of annoying we've
already been over here so I'm just gonna
look over here we know we're doing yeah
we know what we're looking for uh ice
apparently whoa nothing are you so sure
I mean no
take up a thrust when I'm moving fast
enough sure what I owe its mass
generator science is magic the mass
generator lets you increase the ship's
mass tap mass generator to configure its
system power what how will that help us
make us heavier or lighter oh oh we
probably need to uh sink coming up well
say I can only assume yep yep you're
buoyant ok mass generator 1 mass
generator 2 can you go down now just
affirm
I'm actually stuck here right now mass
generator 3 ok oh my god no I can't
steer I can't steer you can't steer mass
generator to thrust hold on thrust up
one does that say about no no we just
need a good descendent you think we just
need to sink well let me know let me
know it's coming up cuz I gotta keep an
eye on my yeah look at what's coming up
weights up is that a thing on that wall
no it's not ok we can go down what's
what's down there what's up look no
that's just okay okay continue sinking
what something right okay
oh my god I think it's about to get real
rich I think it's about to get real
oh my god ready come on stop now now now
oh how do we get over there now um what
happens thrust all the way
thrust all the way yeah press all the
way nope sound turning thrust down mass
dung mass down to one up up
that's dumb how do we get over there I'm
gonna try turning engines all the way up
and then turning to mass make us lighter
now are you moving at all
I'll get over there I guess so you know
we just kind of got to get to the bottom
ish Oh nope wrong way
tell me when now that's fine what's down
there
nothing up
down oh wait no that's how those don't
kill us I thought those might kill us
I thought those would kill us too okay
well they were young we learned a lesson
or doesn't kill I have one person
control the light in one person control
the ship yeah yeah that's what we're
doing I'm controlling the light and the
power and rich is steering the ship I'm
not doing anything right now yeah well
buoyancy we're just going being buoyant
right now and mass generator oh my god
thrust down Thresh down nice
communication nice communication work
that's the panel oh that's hilarious
apparently we're on the wrong side oh
wow that's fine that's fine thank you
it's all love hate it's all a love-hate
kind of thing I'm glad to clarify that
for you and I'm glad I know your love of
us it's very interesting so far this is
exactly what I was expecting by the way
and so I can only assume now we're gonna
run into some sort of like you know
puzzles in which we yeah I would want
something that requires more teamwork
interesting what the fuck
well yeah there it's gonna chase this is
that they're easy
apparently not they're easing us into it
that you just hit a button that's great
going down going down going down wait
thing thing to them thing to explore it
there's more wreckage a lot of shit has
blown up over here it looks like a Scan
button or something
well the scanner is just a light you
know Oh a message for the pilot oh
that's you scanner flare the small craft
scanner system is equipped with flares
flares can be used for marking and
signaling hold be to load flare and
release to shoot
quite the flashlight okay see you ain't
oh my god
okay would you want to go down oh okay
oh oh I get it that's cute this whole
thing is cute
you know what this whole thing is cute
this is Li I mean it's like a Star Trek
game kind of mazes be a little bit more
complicated I I can only admit I imagine
we'll get there but I don't get there
its easiness in rich be comfortable with
me to be like managing a shield system
like FTL that would be great that would
be great Oh tilt controller you can tilt
the gamepad up to 90 degrees in order to
control the pitch of the small craft
what turn us when we can fit to that
hole okay
doesn't really matter last first area
there we go
a spur not too high nope
not to I now
we've been punished for going too high
too many times Oh
blow that up ah sure nope up in there
I'm really sorry that you guys can't see
what's happening on the gamepad cuz it's
a little adorable it looks like an old
windows 97 operating system concerned
pods that's great okay cuz everything's
up
why am i when we went into the concern
pod it turned everything off what's good
what can we doing there ah that was
broken is what the voice said okay so we
need to find other concern pods
that's weird like having to steer
together yeah can Jack ever understand
something on the first read listen
sometimes sometimes and sometimes it
takes a little bit more
all right
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
yep we're a doopy spaceship
oh okay
we can do this I'm assuming that blows
you up now look at me we'll go back up
it bounces off the blue goop yeah blue
goop but not the yeah but we need to hit
them there's a button oh I see I see my
line go back a little bit go back a
little bit boom
there's one button what's over here
hehe oh just assuming I mean
No okay oh wait you can bounce that shit
off with that right oh yeah nice rich
nice rich I need more thruster oh no
you're doing it oh I'm gonna give you
one more thrust
nothing thrust by one whoa oh crap oh no
no that'll work then we get over here
and bounce it off the others okay
returning back to two thrust that's a
comfortable thrust yeah kick it up kick
it up to three three thrust whoa whoa
whoa oh my god that's what happens when
you kick it up to three throw it's fine
jack it's fine hey we fucking did it yay
that was some excellent teamwork rich
yeah we did a thing oh yes I have heard
of space team have you heard of the
mobile game space team it's like it's
like an iPad game where everyone has a
Star Trek controller layout yeah and
like and then I you and I would have two
different controls yeah and and I would
have to mine would say like turn gravity
from 9 to 10 and you would have a little
gravity control you'd have to turn it
and then your screen would give me a
command and then we would just have to
shout back and forth at each other as
fast as we could oh that seems old fast
yeah but it's cute blue oh my god it's a
cute little gag it's a cute little party
game ganc Oh a message for the pilot
oh my the small craft scanner system is
equipped with a sensor this can be used
to detect the sensor range of unknown
artifacts hold Z to activate sensor
okay
Oh
okay so I'm guessing that some sort of
turret and we cannot
oh wait well I'm gonna I'm gonna throw
slowly down a little bit so I can
navigate nice oh thank you huh whoa that
way
yeah oh holy shit something let's blow
up they either blow up or shoot you or
yeah they're either evil Oh
but apparently you that space team you
can have up to like six players okay and
then you all have to shout and look at
your things and it it seems like it
could be fun I I agree that it would
probably get old very fast and it would
it would be a really great drinking game
until everyone got too drunk and mad at
each other oh it was moss all right mass
mass up your mass is grass output meters
the meters let you monitor the sound and
heat and electrical outputs of what the
ship oh my god okay well we got that
going for us then go up let's go up
I'm driving down here I'm the engineer
rich I can't I can't see anything
Oh rich there's a button all right else
we got a second yeah I got a flair
already Oh friend Hey oh wait not yet oh
that's got it oh my god there you go
nice
nice work nice work rich yeah I forgot
I'm the one who actually fires the flare
oh the small craft fuel engine is
equipped with a stabilizer system that
lets you fly smoothly and precise okay
imagine we're gonna need that shit this
day I turned the stabilizer to two
oh no sound heat electricity stabilizer
2/3 stabilizer to 5 max
although then I need to turn throw you
know turn thrust down stabilizer can't
go to max or else I go to reactor stress
okay okay we got it
you got this yeah yeah reactor sure I'm
at four and reactor stress is still
climbing but slowly oh my god aim it at
the button huh
aim at the button I'm aiming nice okay I
need to turn down the stabilizer or else
our stress is getting too much thank you
for second hangar hangar I just give me
a second here reactor stress and
reducing oh my god rich
I already react to stress back up oh my
god did you hit it we hit it is the
depth I got cocky Jack I got cocky and
my skills that scared me cuz my screen
went black and so just as if I was an
engineer of a spaceship I wouldn't know
when death is coming I would just blow
up okay engines umm stabilizer 2/4 will
oh my god I did did I say I was ready
thrust to one I didn't realize the
default setting was 8 billion all right
turned off what's up there
I never remember my god
because of this this is how my screen
looks by the way oh this is where it's
gonna get interesting yeah yeah this is
exactly what my screen looks like
so heat disturbs the artifacts cost
there's money even though we shouldn't
care about that much cuz we just want to
go home we're a crèche
thank rich I eat doughnuts wants you to
honk your horn next time you're
underwater just to hear what it sounds
like I think I did once I might not have
worked okay we could try again okay
Colonel rich mustard this game is really
cute and I agree that J does need to
play this I J would not get this day
wouldn't ya I don't know if David
Guetta's I I had a couple options I
wasn't sure if I was gonna be here
tonight um if he was gonna be here I was
gonna choose something a little simpler
so we could talk over it cuz usually
when Jays here we end up chatting more
than playing but I'm almost glad he's
not here cuz I really wanted to play
this turn the pressure off a bit
thruster up to two stabilizer is to say
sterilizer where me the stabilizer
stabilizer off
everything is a five by the way five and
I guess six cuz you know what you know
it's off but when it's on its it's a one
to five system the ship makes so much
pollution er well oh okay let's see Pete
actually I'd since I turned our
stabilizer off both our heat and
electricity are good okay so that that
detects heat and electricity well what
happened our heat pumped up a little bit
as you were flying
so it's fine did that dock hose any
points I don't know I can't see anything
boycott okay okay hold on I need to turn
our stabilizers on stabilizer to - how
does that work oh oh wait we need to
scan good call good call
hold on I need to turn on our thrusters
down yeah your stabilizer off and our
stabilizer okay
just scanning proceed scanning does not
produce heat escaping this kind of sound
I think you already turn to green all
right we should be good to pass through
these thruster produces heat stabilizer
produces electricity and other stuff
produces sound and those are the three
variables oh I gotta tell this up this
up squeeze through we've got it we got
it
oh that's all my god the smaller fuck
you want the small craft electric engine
is the convenient and fun engine
preferred by many space travelers it
comes with a range of subsystems to
cater to all your exploration needs tap
electric engine to start or stop the
engine although that's probably when we
need to be really quiet oh that's for
you huh
instead a message for the pilot though
oh I guess yeah why is the message for
me I don't know where did Sagan oh yeah
so now there's a fuel engine and
electric engine okay so I can pump so
you can switch between the fuel on the
electric end yeah and which does which
Electric is quiet I can only assume that
the electric is quiet but it might like
it obviously makes more electricity so I
can only assume that this next thing we
have to scan whoa
possibly know that uses a lot of heat
okay so now I'm gonna turn off the fuel
engine Neelu crash turn on the electric
engine oh wait wait wait wait what do
you what we said turn on II thought it
was good to go I said I was turning on
the electric engine I didn't say just go
fuckin forward because the electric
engine as it turns out uses a lot of
electricity so I need to turn that down
don't okay we are now in optimal range
to use the electric you sir I'm sure
everything will be fine now you just
need to settle down
alright we have no heat and very little
electricity because I turned the power
down the thrust power very far down yeah
okay great now I'm gonna turn the thrust
up Wow yeah well you turn the thrust up
okay oh hold on
whoa we gotta turn the electricity way
down now scan the other thing it's - oh
you know what I think I need to go back
to a few London
and we're gonna turn the stabilizers off
hold on okay we are now using no
electricity and so I go back to the
scanner yep yep okay we're good to go
through these two at least and we're
good to go through that one it's fine
it's fine we have to talk rich we're a
team here I'm talking just fine
we're we're team tiny spaceship we're
gonna die in this this lonely rock
that's probably true but there's a
chance we can make it out and go where
Jack back home in this tiny spaceship
maybe I don't think this thing to do
warp speed jack probably not
we're screwed oh my god why we need a
navigator Oh log and help available vote
the log is a record of what happened to
your ship during the adventure tap the
system's mounted
now I guess I'm just going up general
sure that's nothing okay down thing I'm
a scanner nothing
we're approaching we're approaching
landing no no okay there's no oh there's
the things stand it no we need to turn
our heat down to get through that I
should be good to go
Yeah right we're good to go and we're
good to go as long as we move slow on
it's like a turn on the electric engine
yeah did that because looking brother
move okay yeah can you land I get let me
get over here oh well I can probably
land on this okay I just I just switched
over and I'm gonna turn our thrust up
okay now you can move a little faster
good you're good
those are all heat-based Lilou yep
that is a highness that's a he base
that's fine nope well don't honk your
horn that was a that was a song based on
him do you fuck you fuck your gonna cost
us credits not here I mean obviously
something that's 100 maths mess mess
okay hold on turning off electric engine
turning on fuel engine turning on math
generator flipping around flipping
around crank it all the way up it's all
the way up that's not gonna work it's
not work
all right maybe that's what it's got to
do maybe that has to work maybe all
right but right those are a thing down
there we can shoot maybe
scan again nope Oh
if I turn our antigrav all the way up
well fuck no turn orientate grab all the
way down yeah baby Wow Oh was this a
physics thing go up and down up and down
this can't be right
I'm looking for another way I turned the
mass generator up again that didn't seem
to do anything no
what's this it's not everything down
there
or maybe
interesting oh my god anything up here
maybe there's a dead one oh you turned
on the flare give me my flashlight back
maybe we just missed something up here
thought there was like a car loss at
kravaal there's a curve balls over here
it gets us in the garage yeah we're in
the car buzz the first time go it says
girl Phoenix says go all the way up then
turn mash generator on okay so a head
right above the air spout thing and I'll
just crank up the mass generator and
hopefully we'll sink like a stone don't
that's what you were doing
no no that was the the antigravity of
the electric engine Oh already
turn the end turn the engine off and let
us go up okay
wait actually turn the mess off let me
get right over it okay all right now do
antigrav
oh wait you know what I did I turn to
the thrust all the way off our mass is
all the way up now no stabilizer on does
that do anything no I don't know
ha what we do here is
any graph yeah now can you turn the
engines all engines like kill the
engines completely and do the mass
increases a fuel engine needs to be on
for the mass generator can you turn it
down like thrust on that down all the
way and then the mass generator up all
the way yep already yeah oh oh is but
then I need to like turn it on yeah oh
okay hold on go back up back up
okay ready yeah as soon as we fall that
hole I'm holding right no
and this okay
ah okay ready yes oh yeah let's get you
over a little bit I just did you did oh
okay ready okay yeah
alright alright yeah nice cut everything
cut everything cutting everything whoo
oh great
the heads down display by the way that's
what this is called yeah that's cute
because my good night because my head is
down let me hold the controller off you
know I'm gonna have to remember that you
can't see the screen so well that's the
thing yeah yeah that's you that's why I
need I need vocal cues from you because
I can't see the screen at all because I
have to at this first okay my little
props that's the whole point of the game
right just to get people talking but
that we did it Oh objects can't Oh knots
get it off okay that uses heat and
electricity so if I turn my thrusters no
that's not enough so I'm gonna move to
electric engine
Oh blue for a second I hold on it turns
blue when it's good to go huh
not yet all right now we should be good
can you move it all no okay
no not yet hmm okay I think we have to
use regular engine Wow no no I'm just
drifting ah your dravidan sucked that
way yeah oh my god
just turn anything often without
wrapping suck that way yeah
turn the engine on off off off off
oh no never fucked
what's on right now the antigravity
the only thing that's on is the
antigravity does that do anything no all
right let me try let me try turning it
Electric thrust to one okay that might
work but you can't get moving that way
because the antigravity is all up and if
I turn the antigravity on it'll you know
boost us to a little bit okay is there
anything else that if it turned off of
them the only and and if I turn the
engine on it all oh wait what if I if I
turn the engine on at all it produces
too much heat if i turn any thrust on
does that do anything I know about that
No scan it again
so it's gotta be electric engine let
certain things out let's see if there's
another way oh wait here we go
move nope nope too much okay wait now
try moving nope that's still too much
so that's anti grab on one and thrust on
one on the electric engine and that gets
us too far into the electric field if I
turn on the engine and turn our thrust
even to one we get too much heat we're
gonna try to like jump into it yeah okay
tell me when to cut it give me some more
something cuz I won't stop I'm almost
stuck here okay you got to thrust can
you turn it off like instantly maybe
give me give me can you can you like
give me a ton of thrust and then just
cut it all right okay let's try that
again
how's this thrust give me just full
thrust and I think which is where we
were you gotta cut it quick though I
think all right you ready to cut ready
cut it all right it was a great job
we're cutting it I didn't get it instead
of cutting it I actually turned it up to
max you know what my bad my bad
everybody bad yeah Jack we're time I
don't think you can apologize we're dead
oh well you know hey you ready cut wait
let's scan it for it okay it's all ready
all right hold on hold on hold on hold
on stabilize there all the way off all
right I'm ready
and cut it apparently there's a
cool-down phase okay
so cut earlier got it earlier ah okay
alright cut it
oh there's a big cooldown phase with the
heat okay cuz it's the hot engine so
maybe I gotta use the electric engine
yes okay no wait wait it's only to hold
it I did I wanted to test the cooldown
Oh electricity and by the way the
cooldown rate for the electricity much
faster this is it and cut it hey can you
cut that real quick mister I mean as
fast as I did it there alright cut it
cut it I'm okay oh oh I do I need to
turn it back on
we got eaten by a plant oh my god all
right okay okay
Oh fuckin K this is it rich
I am ready I am ready okay I am ready
then if you already cut it
oh no what
we're in the bad space oh well okay
and cut
I have to think I have to yeah remember
yeah okay oh shit oh shit that was me
that was me my bad my bad I was so happy
we made it out of the one trap oh my god
Phoenix you're right we just got eaten
by spikes this game has taken spikes to
a new and interesting place oh wait are
we dead uh oh shit okay scan you need to
do that I I am there's no flashlight oh
oh oh sorry the scanners we're not
okay these are electricity based all
that weight was it I am I'm bobbing
around that's what this thing does
okay so I think let's try moving our
thrusts and our anti-gravity I need to
turn our fuel engines back up wait
I don't know these are also heat based
what can you just turn on antigrav
just anti-graft will slide up without
steering you think yes I think I'm
almost 100% sure
all right we're through what kind of
regular engine motion okay
thrust what's down there alone it turn
your thrust down a little bit yeah oh
here we go
the decelerator slows down the small
craft to stop in midair as long as you
are not applying thrust
oh okay so like a quick stop don't go on
the electric engine which I can only
assume we'll need at some point but oh
oh the spikes are gonna eat us look at
that so basically if you let go we just
stop fucking thing again all right give
me emotional okay
I'm liking this it's getting better
oh shit mouth shit all right give me
juice give me juice
I'll give you a little more thrust oh
shit
too much too much too fast okay okay
okay okay Iola go down one thrust
should I turn the anti-graft to two
instead of three you're kind of three
it's kind of like stable I guess
are you moving up too much or is fine
yeah we're good we're good
gonna make it through break break yeah
oh shit that just that doesn't stop us
in midair oh oh no no to break you just
like oh no I just like all the things
that is that I'm now
yes that is okay okay decelerate or is
on the decelerate is on for I say yeah
for precision flying mmm gotta move
gotta move oh shit yeah they just
down here
so we don't tilt okay hold on we need to
find a place to toes - stop stop stop
tell me what we're good to go
reactor stress almost reached critical
mass yeah yeah okay ready
thrust is going up to - no downer up jab
horse the piece hold on I'm gonna move
thrust up two three okay okay here we go
oh shit and throw it scan it scan the
thing I'm scanning
okay back that goes for sound and it
looks like cool down our decelerator
produces some sound turn it off we can
do without the children we'll be fine
we'll be fine turn it down to three all
right so you can start moving now see
with oh wait we will what is making that
noise
god dammit rich decelerator at two and
now try moving we're just at the
threshold
it shouldn't hear us but you guys move
shit damn it Did you touch it
i I moved too fast okay alright
cuz the vines reached out for me so
alright so I'm gonna move too fast we
should be able to get past it should I
move your thrust down more
or fire
ah okay I guess I'm assuming this is
gonna be the same thing that is the same
thing so as long as you move slowly it
should be fine
nice and is expert piloting okay again
that there's a new thing okay that is an
electricity and heat thing scan thing
under it
I think they group yeah their
electricity I'm good to go no no we are
not good to go we need to reduce our
electric intake so I think if I just
turned the decelerator down
significantly or off about fuel or we
could go to field well it's also a heat
thing okay what's over here I'm sorry
that's not the way we're supposed to go
nope okay and you scan to the rocks no I
cannot scan through the rocks oh you
know what I bet we could do it but we
can just drop oh wait go all the way
down again go down in this one okay are
there man-eating plants at the bottom
because I bet we could just drop um yes
okay can you leave the decelerator on
just the decelerator yeah and oh I can't
fall that way that way I'm thinking if I
just turn the electric engine off all
right I'll give it a cue okay ready yeah
off huh good good nice nice yeah we did
that terribly died like eight times we
hit all of those ancient artifacts on
our way down too but they didn't detect
us yes affordable space adventure is on
the Wii U and actually it's one of the
only games that actually uses the
gamepad if it's full potential hmm I
think this is a Wii U exclusive I
believe and so I have the gamepad and
I'm like touching the screen while what
rich has a Wiimote and Nunchuk to
control other stuff with nope with no
annoying pointing at the screen I might
add
something's up oh my god oh my god okay
moving oh oh I can move in this Oh with
the electric engine Shh oh it's just
kind of quiet wait wait how about a
water now I want to hear it outside
water ah that's nice that's a nice
little touch
why is this water special oh we use the
different type of engine yeah cuz now
we're in the electric engine so electric
engine swims apparently but no mass
generator
if we ever need to like fall fast I
guess bet that'll end up being a puzzle
oh my god what the crates this looks
fantastic I love I love the look of this
Oh
all right okay oh shit
Jack do something cut everything cut
everything it senses electricity and
only electricity turns Beckham back on
you're good to move quick right thing
closes I can't move I can't move
okay now I can't move I'm stuck huh I'm
stuck how about now or just thinking oh
oh right okay now okay cool
that thing is an electric is here right
so we are we're on Becca an electric
engine so we probably need to need to
fall through this thing now okay hold on
yeah
already yeah you're ready to turn things
back oh I'm ready to get in motion at a
moment's notice
absolutely but now
I need to tilt through here okay tilting
up straight okay okay good good
so tilt there's a button
oh that probably opened something back
over by it yeah okay
everything's so adorable they're super
rich uh-huh I'm so happy playing this
I'm so happy playing with United
spaceship game this makes me happy
Lisa play this right she might okay oh
now this is gonna be interesting
oh shit float oh ma okay ready yeah
loading up we're stocking loading up
mark
nothing to see here I'm afraid and we're
free
okay what did that open up up here
probably oh yeah that's right
earth
did we do we fall here uh no I don't
think so I think a gate opened up okay
it's dum-dum near the top of this thing
or the bottom of that thing
we hey we did it yay rich Jack on a tiny
spaceship adventure red jack
making it through alien worlds yeah
they'll solve problem using friendship
and teamwork pyrite is alright by me
anyway
a lot of TV on I must move my not me
real gold you see wait no one what what
did something blow up I got a weird
error message okay my ears yeah sorry
subscribers oh sure let's take a little
subsea bruh bruh yeah
cuz we made it through that harrowing
cave that was that was really fun okay
let's see here we have smite time just
needs an end there sports and I'm yeah
never be perfect it's my time makan
macaws neck Mick cosmic rooster J mr.
Forman le devoir oh five Davide just
done oh it's Dave ah it's Dave aaaa
0:05 Frank Brian Butterfield Dave I do
thank you all for subscribing
we very much appreciate it it's truly
really do yep yeah I wish you had a
player camera just to see what's on my
screen um but we don't I'm sorry to
subscribe is just fine with me
did it it gives us much-needed buddy we
buy games and play them cash is better
to the Florida sweater
I won't freeze to death this winter I'm
doing a hambone solo ok all right
right great here we go here we go we're
moving on we are we are making it oh so
red red this is straight up oh nice and
across oh wait actually hold on for a
second oh my god hold on for a second
spike weeds I forgot to insert a
bookmark ok I'm right Oh spike weeds
don't care oh there's a thing up here
there's a thing over here what this is
well go green first we need a navigator
oh whoa
I think it's dead I think it's being
punished oh I can't get through the
shame oh wow
what it's kept us from going through
then it's up keep you guys for going
through okay
no matter what the puzzle was maybe our
engines will just said perfectly I
happenstance for whatever that was sure
I don't know okay great bye rich and
Jack musical only 1999 at the rlm start
coming soon are we good to get through
that
no no we're not okay let's see here it
takes up heat and electricity and
there's a okay on that other one too huh
scandal my guess is yeah the same thing
all right okay all right so anti gret oh
I think I can go here Oh No cuz that
just makes you sink right yeah there can
you fly yeah oh no we're still in the
danger zone there can you fly like now
can I are still in danger zone I might
fall
what does that look like if you fly
around nope
no that's too much this has got to be
another electric engine thing or another
way around or another way around hmm cuz
yeah we can't we can't rock it through
that or else we'll hit that yep yeah
well let's I'll give you some more
thrust let's look around
alright I go too much tourists
let's see what's back down here maybe
this had some clues there's a clue
yep
which I don't I don't which I don't
think that some rich I don't think
that's gonna work I don't know I don't
think that's gonna work all right all
right we're going back
oh that thing's like magnetized
interesting scan that red light rose
that red light everything no I can't get
this thing to follow us let do anything
okay oh how did that stick to us what
does it say when you see what the scan
information er nothing
it gives me an electricity flow am i
doing that are you doing that it gives
me a electricity flashing but you know
no warnings really
you know there's there's there's
definitely a magnetized thing happening
you know all right all right head back
up maybe I just need to relook at some
of the controls as to what does what
what's giving us our weird heat
electricity thing
okay heat electricity oh you know what
what you know it uses electricity the
scanner really yes
so if I turn the scanner off the thrusts
down to one and the anti-graft to two
and the deceleration all the way off
does that yeah how's that can you move I
can't go up I will probably crash into
the laser okay hold on let me see if I
can stay up no I can't okay
that's too much right now can you move
I'm sitting fuel won't work
mm-hmm fuel I don't think I'll work cuz
I think that gives us too much heat okay
yeah no we'll crash oh the laser okay so
right now the only thing pumping
electricity is thrust an anti-gravity
anti graph is that too now and you're
barely making it up you know I turn the
thrust all the way off in just the Anti
Doping nope
so like the in order to be under the
electricity benchmark the thrust needs
to be at one and no anti grab but then
you can't move right yeah or what are
the fuel options so then the fuel
options for heat the only thing that
generates heat is the mass generator and
the thrust what about the flares I mean
I'm sure the flames can be but my
scanners gonna so as soon as my thrust
is that one if you go really slow maybe
can you putter along hold on I can
stabilize you
yeah all right
right stop moving dot this is the no I'm
stabilized motion it just happens no and
you're still too hot just have one
thruster too hot okay
hmm
we could try another cup the engines the
engines at the last moment see them I
don't think a will but that's right yeah
I'm ready
no not even a little bit not even a
little bit
oh I voted for Koto's yes the game is is
co-op is one screen cops'll I'm
controlling like what power goes to one
and Rich's steering and yeah taking care
of other stuff so it's it's a one screen
co-op game okay hold on turning engines
on okay
okay scanners taking up electricity so
right now electricity is being taken up
by the thrust anti grab and decelerate
er we don't need the D stellarator at
all so I'll turn that off turn
anti-graft to one but then we just won't
move go anywhere you can move a little
bit now right but yeah we're still in
the red even moving a little bit can you
move a little bit now time to these
things up is there right now that one
anti-gravity and we're barely under the
threshold turning up to three on the
thrust nope what I'm not moving though
it's fine sure I want to see if I could
stop moving thing sure cut cut along
putt-putt alone yeah
then work didn't work okay let's try
this again want to be our navigator
we're we're we're both playing this game
at the same time you know something one
shift so I'm I control like power to the
engines and riches like steering and
like shooting flares and stuff we could
have a navigator if you felt like
navigating no pressure don't worry about
it okay okay
we need to do here okay wait I know cuts
a cut scanner that's number one because
that takes up electricity hmm
what if I take deceleration down thrust
all the way down an anti grab all the
way up no no that kills us okay drift it
in there oh you drifted in it okay okay
okay okay okay okay
so I think I've just makes you go up
yeah and then it uses too much
electricity just by itself but here
we're fine but there's no thrust at all
can you switch between anti-gravity Rep
Italy huh
I'll wait in here hold on I want to try
to like buoyant us out here hold on I
think
this can't be the right puzzle can you
but one thrust is okay or one antigrav
is okay right
am I correct yeah well even right now
I'm at for anti grab an assign but as
soon as you hit that thruster it'll go
red can you switch between and you grab
and thrust like give me a de Graaff
thrust any redress integrate first let's
experiment down here
like can you do that can you turn the
antigrav and switch between that with
rust no well keeping us in the green no
okay
but we might be able to do I'm going not
the right direction here what's that
what's that what's that what do we just
do what was that yeah oh no we're just
we're just way so basically here's what
I'm wondering yeah now let go this is
what we need to do okay so we can drift
we can drift so we have one thruster
actually I could probably even turn it
up to like two thrusters this is what we
need to do all right the end this anti
graph makes us buoyant oh wow so
basically as soon as you hit the red
zone knock off the thruster alright and
we should be good to go okay we did it
we have turbo fire soon huh no no you
just stop hitting the thruster can I
steer like this no turns off try
everything off
um huh huh huh oh sorry sorry I see that
now
I didn't want to turn everything off I
know what's happening now
are we sent through this huh wait no
through what oh oh no oh no we gotta be
outside okay
hold on now scanner off deceleration off
antic arrived at three thrust at two
electric engines on okay I have control
of the anti graphs we are ready to go
cut engine on engine I'm okay good give
me give you back my my flirt I'm not
gonna need the floor I've just like that
whoa okay oh yeah we might want scanners
back scanners back okay they seem to be
attractive to the scanners the weird or
the weird look this good it's like a
yeah this whole thing is very body ish
like I said is originally an inner space
game like style and I'm necessarily
unlicensed right Oh could you give me
more power I can give you a bunch more
power you are now in max anti grab here
here's more thrust
Maxo Rustom Andy Grove okay hold on
Wow that I use too much power let's try
fuel engines okay now get more juice
give me more oh my god I tried to give
you more juice but I turned it off oh my
god I have so many concussions Wow
already okay okay maximum juice maximum
juice and we're doing it we're through
Oh Mike I'm gonna pull up we're gonna
pull up got everything okay wait we're
just back here now oh wait a book oh
that's right we had a button what now
what do we do back here
there's shit over here this thing high
fives all around
that was great
oh we figured it out everything's happy
nothing is happy everything is doom

[Part II]
are you going on in the chat I'm
listening
high five this everyone's very excited
that we did it
movie dicks are doing a Mad Max night
yeah yeah nice oh my god Jays really
back yeah you just you just had pops in
to jazz to leave now cuz he just heard
Mad Max across town he's Randy he ran
over her next Tuesday
the corner I don't all three so much so
no they didn't do it yesterday
next Tuesday movie Diggs is dreaming but
I confirm that within the Chatham's next
Tuesday vyd movie dicks I've now been
doing three movies tonight after the
stream movie dicks when you're doing Mad
Max movie dicks and then people get
together in the chat and talk about the
movie that they're all watching next
Tuesday Mad Max of fun next Tuesday
movie dicks come here to chat and
they'll give you the links to watch the
streams movie dicks for people who don't
know the oh sure the chat as has
organized thing completely on their own
which we approve of they they all meet
together in the the twitch chat and
Tuesdays I'm after streams they they all
watch a movie together while chatting
yep
it's fun i watch daredevil with him it
was great no god but ben affleck there
that was so awful it was way worse than
you could ever imagine I mean I saw and
they I never thought it was bad until I
rewatched it you know as an adult
apparently rich is dying again
I'm always dying that's true I guess we
all spend your whole life slowly dying
that's true yeah yeah he's slowly dying
alright back to the top i J
whoa oh my god oh my god throw us down
thrust down yeah that's fine I just
don't want I like going fast jack I know
I got a need for speed
Jack now we are definitely in a body yep
this plot going on here definitely you
know these are like eggs okay that is an
electricity monster so it turned out a
stabilizer oh my god well use this
electricity scanner the stabilizer I now
we should be good
that is an electricity monster oh my god
probably don't want to touch it I mean
oh fuck that came out of nowhere
oh no we're not that no we're not dead
rich just wanted to go fast again that
sounds like a really Hornet real arm
Oh hold on scanner yeah okay that is a
heat monster so turning our not yet it's
just floating them all right you should
be ready to go knock into it to feeling
dick
do you want to hear hey hey remember
when you shot me with that thing
how's that feel shooter Jennifer hey I
won't get you miss check oh my god I
feel nice a dick a dick in a space when
traveling through the colon we're
traveling through Dennis Quaid why is it
so drunk in here no Dennis Quaid you got
it all wrong Randy Quaid Martin Short
this blade was other thing Dennis Quaid
was the guy he was riding through in
Innerspace no I have it backwards this
Dennis Quaid was riding in Martin Short
what the hell is wrong with you
I knew Dennis Quaid was in it Jabbar do
you ever one luck Skywalker told Darth
Vader that he was his father I do
remember that that was a weird scene
wait hold on
I don't engine shortcuts press R or L to
quickly turn your engine's on or off oh
I know what we got to do what kind of
monsters are these doesn't you gotta
turn your engine off no sir
scan these monsters I did huh okay ready
yeah you had to know something like that
was coming why were you waiting for the
quick turn on after the introduction of
the quick startup quick turn off why
Jack okay I'm ready
oh you know what the real problem is I
didn't have the decelerator on okay
and the decelerator stops you
automatically so you don't have to touch
anything
all right ready yeah maybe you should
touch something sorry we've done so many
times so many times
okay okay okay ready yeah I'm ready
are you ready I might not be ready I
don't think you are here we go
I'm oh my god oh my god
my piloting skills saved us your your
mad skills like crack shot piloting
skills I can't go there
skin you hit the Scan button
I was hitting the flare that is an
electricity monster and a heat monster
oh okay I know this one yep I know this
one uh so don't do anything right now
I'm taking up our electricity
you just get ready to hit the engine the
second we could pass whatever this is no
I don't know what's taking up our
electricity scandal scanners off do I
need to turn the fuel engine on it's
also a heat monster I thought I could
just use the antigravity we're slowly
going up are we yeah yeah we're okay
yeah how's that perfect okay I'm gonna
turn the fuel engine
this is not helping
none of this is helping
because if I turn the electric engine on
can we float - can we drift past like
last time
no I uses too much electricity okay just
floating up I'm trying to figure it out
like
oh you know we might have to do one so
I'm gonna turn the electric engine on
its thrust all the way up okay
are you know turn the anti graph to
neutral thrust all the way up and then
I'm just gonna like click it off to try
to we're try to jump past it all right
so I'm gonna go go here we go on now
nope there again all right I'll go all
right ready go
yep cut nope gotta go faster yep well
I'm turning the decelerator all the way
off I guess it doesn't really matter
forget I thrust is all the way up all
right I'm ready and you know that you
have to cook cut button ready right
quick cut button right gang Oh barely on
who I never got salt ready yep and fault
okay ready for full throttle or is it
down here here oh great now easy alright
nevermind nevermind nevermind nevermind
nevermind yep that was really graceful I
know my name is Tate I'm sorry yes it
doesn't matter if we got the job done
with grace and style and that we just
got it done which is more important huh
man well considering we're broadcasting
this I think grace and style I'm just
hoping we can bubble our way through to
tell you the truth you here's a question
good do you care if your sports team of
choice clumsily wins the championship
does that matter or the Broncos won the
Superbowl but you know they fumbled the
ball a few times they won actually
through fumbling it was really strange
they fumbled it another one of the team
members picked it up then someone else
fumbled it got real lucky that's all I'm
saying
oh I see what we're gonna have to do
scan the thing first though we're gonna
hitch a ride Oh hold on the small craft
is equipped with three types of landing
gear stuffs soft sticky are sliding okay
we're gonna watch sticky yeah
who controls the landing gear you
possibly verily I have no button someone
indicate otherwise so I guess we gotta
land on that thing cut cut all powers I
don't know babe long we don't want to
cut the car to the landing gear
obviously well this is a this is a sound
monster right here yeah so this is like
doing stuff like that it would really
piss it off but you're under the sound
threshold so really we just need to land
and glide by without moving all right
okay I'm gonna land that thing huh I'm
gonna land on that thing okay ready
sticky on okay Jack I don't think you're
right about anything I had too many
things on we have too many things on we
have too many things out okay okay hold
on let me turn some things down
when do we I'm sorry do you have a
police light is with the scanners blue
yeah LeClair is rig rapidly switch
between them nothing that does not like
what you're doing
alright stickies on your joik
oh my god the sound does have a
cool-down I turn the engines off I think
that's what I need to do is to kill the
engines and put it in neutral stock car
time now running with the cruise control
cruise control yeah I already yep we're
good to go
and I'm gonna turn it on as soon as we
get out on that sticky off
well
down down down goes
nope
did that kill us maybe need that on the
block I would assume so
and I'm gonna say yes oh it's over here
let's figure out the rest of this place
can that thing that's a sound monster
again
I don't know if we do need that on the
block
I mean you were sooo hey cuz I'm
assuming what time would you skip a
juice no juice you got electric juice
what else around I'm just fuckin thing
right
oh maybe do we need to get that thing
over here to block that thing possibly
that's what I would assume well we have
to get him up I don't know how we'd get
that off gotta get it up
nope
all right we have fully explored okay so
yeah I think we need to take that thing
and then move it up to block the laser
I'm gonna give you more thrust I don't
know how the hell we're supposed to get
this off oh we could probably land on it
and carry it oh my god no no no oh wait
can we carry backup maybe on sticky off
just a on sticky on oh my god we totally
can but we need to go through that laser
thing well we can need to put it on the
conveyor right okay great great and I'm
just gonna do the same thing where I
kill the hold on hold on oh my god oh my
god okay I'm sick I'm sick I'm sick
no no it's fine we go through yeah I
turn the power off Barham oh yeah do
some more juice yeah give me all the
juice I can't have all the juice cuz
you're about to run out of juice fine I
can't have all the juice because I'll
kill the crate and her friend alcoholics
okay put it back put back there just
hang there for a second

stroking his shaft reach your arm I'm
just come someone hug when they've had
like a bad day
oh wait years you're a sick perverted
man Jack makes more sense a sick
perverted man I mean I guess that
because I guess that makes I guess that
makes more sense
then what I was unless you're gay which
point that's that's perfectly natural
it's perfectly normal
it really is I'm gonna go to the
bathroom okay you talk to people kill
time I'm gonna confirm by lying down
here and having my back kind of sort of
bothered me a bit that's how I'll kill
time Jack hi what's going on I can't
even see the chance so it's not like we
can we can interact they monitor with
the chance all the way at the other side
of the room and I I can't get up to look
at it because I'm I'm an invalid I'm
essentially an invalid
yeah how's everyone doing
you enjoying this stream I mean you
gonna answer me I can't see it feel free
to answer me anyway you enjoy the stream
oh right that's great
what what
so we've been playing the shit out of
this game yeah that's the thing that
happened I call me dinner Evans I can't
even play the game to pass time awkward
Oh a real a sweet release of death where
is it
where is the sweet release of death hmm
let's just let's just sit here and be
quiet for a moment
7-7 moment of silence for Nicole Simpson
and that other guy
dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt house
arrest that guy I don't know I don't
know what the fuck I'm doing
just don't some stretch of smile mild
stretches here because I should I really
should
yes yeah we could take a break myself
great I'm sorry to leave you alone with
the rich then what are you doing oh my
god rich is getting up
Jax just went for reach Jax just went
for a reach and had a bathroom time I
needed a bathroom break you know what I
had a big ass coffee before we started
screaming and some water so what is what
true what we say most things are true
what we say I guess Allah now I'm by
myself
oh rich it was Ron Goldman captain if
Vic says there are legitimate excuses
for going to see pixels losing a bet
perhaps having a loved one held for
ransom may be a serious blow to the head
yeah that's about it I mean the I think
the only there there are two legitimate
reasons to go see pixels one is if you
are watching it for some sort of movie
review type program and two is if you
have a mental deficiency and so if you
if you say to yourself man that Adam
Sandler sure it makes funny movies and
Kevin James is also good and I want to
see a movie about retro arcade games
coming to life then you might have a
mental deficiency or it's for work right
I think that I think this movie
diminishes Pacman's love ability because
of his involvement in the movie and so
even if you just really like pac-man or
Donkey Kong there's no reason to see
this movie
if you if you're a fan of peckmon you
have very few other options even if
you're a fan of pac-man
what will seeing a crappy movie with
that pac-man happens to be in do for you
I mean if you're a fan of Donkey Kong
yeah then you can just watch King Kong
in like a tiny screen sure that's pretty
much the same thing where you could
watch king of Kong which is a great
movie yeah yeah you got me there yeah
rich did you see um do you see the new
XCOM 2 trailer I know okay all right I
don't know there was a new trailer
there's a new trailer Oh check it out
when I get home okay all right we're
back we have a couple new subscribers
I'll thank you right now because when
I'm Zeno trope and dysphoria blues thank
you for sub scribe Eng we really it's
true a really do rish
it that was awful
right that was fucking awful I think you
know where I'm trying something new
that's gonna be the new thing we really
appreciate it
what about stru we really do I don't
understand why Peter Dinklage is in the
movie cuz he's a midget no he but he
doesn't take those roles well he does
know he's famous no no because like he's
famous for not taking the stereotypical
midget roles he just sold out he did
sell out but I don't think his role is
like a midget I think he's playing the
Billy West he's in the movie because
he's a midget no he's in the movie
because he's a hot actor right now he's
also in the movie because he's a midget
no I had him Sandler is in charge and
Adam Sandler in his head he put him in
the movie because he's a mid you know I
don't believe that I believe that I
think anyone with the name recognition
recognizability what's who's that who's
the antagonist of king of Kong Billy
West
no silly wes is the voice actor right
fry and the M&M; and others he because he
has read and Stimpy you know he has the
mullet Peter Dinklage has the mullet and
pixels so I think he's supposed to be
the what's his fucking name King Billy
King now and after the king that's a
tennis player that's Billie Jean King
that's Billie Jean King it's not Billy
Corgan really Mitchell thank you thank
you mall Radko Billy Mitchell and other
guide Billy Mitchell I'm the good guy
and so he's the Billy Mitchell character
and and it's just because he's a hot
named actor at the moment okay oh I got
too much thrust thrust down oh okay that
is that's our same old Electress oh you
know what we had
we have sliding gear slide a year on I
cut engines or through and I'm through
great
oh you know what sliding a gear off my
sliding your right now I never with her
ah rich your your maverick
I know if only tied eight times put a
piloting error
all right that is again an electricity
and heat monster we have landing gear we
have soft sticky what a soft doin slide
does that make us bounce yeah
I don't know it's soft does all right
well how do we get through this thing
what is this what is this allergic to
heat and electricity so basically this
is an engines off kind of monster okay
here's what we do we glide in okay and
then once we hit the button then we
slide out okay okay so we need glide
ease slide ease hey ready that was an
engineer
okay I'm going yep cut it whatever you
want all right shoot that thing stick
sick oh okay I see oh okay I see you
then you can show okay I'm with it sorry
engines on all right that stick there's
a shoot shoot all right
nice slide ease off nice rich we pwned
that area what no we don't we don't say
that what happen pika because it's a
ridiculous word life is ridiculous you
know also true
shut it I mean let me just
reconnaissance what's up here we're kind
of oh oh so many things I was born we
got button there everything wants to
move but it's a button we can just head
that's the door we need to open oh these
are sliding puzzles oh my god these are
definitely slightly puzzles oh my god
there's the thing there I'm sure these
are all heat and electricity monsters
yep
skin yep
go sticky go sticky
ha
uh-oh I'm sticky and move him with this
way now you know this isn't gonna work
sticky go okay yeah we need to get I
think there's something we can do with
this though oh we got a gun I think it's
just to get on the other side and then
you know pop out easy oh yeah that makes
perfect sense
yeah that's what we starting down sure
here first all right
was that that was the other problem down
here right yeah we already did okay I'm
gonna get a slider you ready
we got time it ready now we need a
little more thruster and now oh oh yeah
then I'll get us a button okay that's
right we get stuck good no I can't I can
only imagine that there's no getting
stuck yeah
all right we got one Oh slow your
thruster roll crazy pilot gotta fall
under I'm hurting off him it's can't
leave it off Oh God Oh No okay
hold on I think we're fine yeah
know what scanner off I think if I just
turn an anti grab on all right
nope oh I get it that what the wheel we
need to go to sticky ah
oh okay
we have sliders stick yeah
good enough good enough for me oh I
sense some slight ease coming up start
it now nope momentum momentum stick
Lourdes yes this is a cop game I Jack is
controlling the jack is controlling like
the power supplies and riches steering
and guiding me because I need to look at
the power supplies Wow whoa wait it's
kinda thing you need to get up there oh
oh or do we need to shoot oh fuck
you slide ready
I got a flare ready okay oh well you hit
it I wonder if that counted unknown
let's find out
yep okay so one more I think there's
yeah there's one more Oh what's up here
heat me up here is up here up here is up
here how are you why are you so curious
whoa useful here oh god how do we how do
we do that
how do we do that push we can we stick
to the bottom we slide on the bottom I
don't think we can slide now can you
tilt us around
that's not know there's there's gravity
we can't slide no I can't turn this
other way around this might just be a oh
can we stick to that can we stick to the
underside yeah but that won't help us
yes it will how will that help us get to
the top and then let go and then fold
the bottom platform oh oh no we can't
cuz I can't turn all the way around okay
you just move fast enough yeah okay
great
right now there's gonna probably one
another one up here yeah yeah oh yeah
this one super awesome fun time we gotta
we gotta do some mad jump yeah oh oh god
oh god no oh God
sliders on get us through okay I'm ready
to slide ready oh nice good good that's
very satisfying it's like a shuttlecraft
you know why it's like a shuttlecraft
yeah cuz it keeps crashing oh I get it
that's a Star Trek joke I get that's a
very that's a fine because every time
somebody uses a shuttlecraft you know
it's gonna crack down yeah I'm a planet
like you know I get it I get it
and it's funny because the script
required somebody did not get stranded
they would just use the transporter the
ship would fly their picture
we-we-we sorry you know how fast you
were going
sprays police we're her space yeah which
I are pretty cool just say rich yeah can
I talk to you about a hamburger a
hamburger can I talk to you about a
hamburger yes you can
I feel awful today and I you know what I
had for dinner what I had a go-gurt okay
a child's go-gurt that sounds awful yeah
yeah what'swhat's this is what steal
hair yeah I'm fighting to drop in and
then somehow get to that oh sure wait
well we get in that whole talk you know
we need to shoot so we stick to it
I get stickies and then turn off the
engine and once we stick so if I go
around you know oh wait oh I see yeah
and shoot the laser he they go in damage
egg what we need to get in that hole
yeah but what kind of monster is that oh
no that's an everything monster by the
way that is a sound heat electricity
monster but we can still use the landing
gears right
I would fly over and then you cut
everything and then we stick to the
bottom okay that's the plan okay
oh I can't get over we can only get in
from no we didn't go over well we can
get in from the other side
oh wait can we well this is matter what
sign out dinner okay stickies ready yeah
I'm going in turn stickies off let's
fall fall we need to be on the bottom of
this this thing sticky sticky
all right you aim for the thing oh this
is like Oh like I'm stick stick stick
this is not gonna work what are you
doing we hit it we hit it no no I was
gonna we were gonna have to think wait
why'd we get there we can angle we can
angle let go let go let go damn it jack
rich were on the edge no this is gonna
be great all right this is gonna work
we're on the edge ready or not
Jack where's my thing oh there it is
okay
well you don't do what I tell you to do
so I'm not gonna tell you I'll tell you
I thought I thought being on the edge
here would be make shooting easier don't
think it should aim down disengage where
do we need to go on the other side of
this thing yeah yeah yeah just just
disengage disengage just give me power
did you know okay ah okay Oh God
Richards captain and me as engineer is
heartbreaking
oh that's all this herding cats herding
cats oh my god yeah I think that's a
pushy thing down there over there
oh I think we need to go down where the
button was what the button is yeah
there's a hole think he's ready
because it doesn't really matter no it
doesn't shadow haha engineer um I'm
taking applications for a new engineer
would you would you know that would be
in nightmare
I am not used to it sure do you all do
you really wants to huh which way that's
which I can be an engineer it's fine
that was more just Hey
okay oh oh that's fun if you like
stopping progress
just slutty Samoa guys just slide right
in I turn it off I turn it off
immediately okay I just wanna let you
know that okay this time just ladies
through slide ease just ladies now it's
nineties I think grabbity might take us
in sure no bouncies don't know that
stickies bouncies oh it's not really
bouncy that's just soft landing let's
put us on normal that's not our area
and I just need to cut sooner cut
slide
are we gonna hit the button again to
their rabbit grab Alfred
I don't think this is gonna work sorry I
wasn't ready to hit the button again
miss oh my god what are you doing huh
getting them just moving us is my work
don't don't don't let go for no reason
well that was close
that was close okay all right we can do
this
boom alright slide
sliding we're getting all sliders up in
this
all right all wrong
all right nice hey you think up or down
I see what's up
is that blocky thing oh maybe we need to
take it with us
sure oh my god we what do I need to do
with it before I stop carrying it around
with us everywhere left lost yeah rich
you are a reckless pilot I am I totally
am Top Gun Jack haha my gun nothing I
think I know what we need to do with
this now
sticky sticky more thrust power lot more
something warm we're in any kind of
danger zone we're getting in there the
more you move it the more danger where
maybe we need to hold on I think I'm
gonna move to fuel engine okay
okay give that a try
mark more alone more getting there okay
you got more okay
no no no no it was gonna kill us well we
hit it a weird angle
well your fault wasn't anyone it was
just fuck yes but it was oh hey look
yeah oh yeah that works that's what I
was trying to do oh and he came down it
came down sideways rich this ship needs
more communication you needed to you
needed to communicate your plans well
that was that wasn't anything you can do
it was just piloting well I'm just
saying if you would have communicated
the plan I wouldn't have cut power I
would have trusted in your piloting a
bit oh oh you cut power I did kept our
why did you do that
why would I ask why would I have to
deconstruct you not to do something well
cuz I cuz I from my point of view is
like oh we're gonna die I should cut
power in case we're gonna seize us we're
gonna spin this thing yeah and get in
that hole and then we're gonna spit it
back I'm already on it I got my stick Oh
so I didn't be to explain bad it was
obvious based on what was going on in
the screen
dude's more primer like oh it's gotta go
back out on its own gave me a ton of
power once we let go yeah we're ready
let me know when you let go let go okay
okay I was afraid it would move on its
own it didn't we're gonna stare cut cut
cut too much oh reactor overload yeah
yeah we're gonna we're gonna cool down
for a bit
yep there you go
there you go all right how we stuck to
it huh how we stuck
we are stuck to it we are moving okay
more power
Hey
so and took me down what but first I I
think but first it's all fine but first
dad that that I can't get J to play the
third guy he's not here anymore
this game is potentially a friendship
destroyer you're right no this is
classic multiplayer this is but this is
like we both win this is a friendship
tester is what it is and we're feeling
we're I mean we're not doing great
well whoa
you know what that's too much power for
you that's too much sir wha-what
yes fines too much power no cool your
jets maverick what whoa whoa what all
right what's blue dude oh that's the
bouncy yeah right fine
don't turn that up we get a button I
don't know what it's turning on or off
but sure I hit a button oh cool oh my
god
we're swimming again yes we being weird
dark water yeah murky or in summer Oh
ooh a red one red is usually bad
well I read usually means something else
leaves here
we got something we got options we got
some options ready what do you want Jack
ah you know blues right there so maybe
blue camera I can't see them you can't
know
okay okay these are all electricity and
slightly sound monsters mostly
electricity so I think actually I can
just do that oh oh oh yes
I'm turning your thruster way down okay
now give you some thrust good I can tell
ya we're still in aa we're still in out
of tricity monster I think I need to
turn off your stabilizer thrust way down
stabilizer off you are good to go yeah
so I go somewhere not smelling it so
that's why there's a pinky over there so
I guess we can go back to the pinky all
right Pinkett us out swabbing yourself
oh that's a that's a reference to Star
Wars Episode one The Phantom Menace yes
I can't go up why can't I go up anymore
there we go you're gonna do it old
Bessie
- I don't wanna go into blue Stano keep
it like a must keep it like a let's keep
it shitty we ended up back here okay all
right don't mind the disco dance party
okay so I guess that purple and don't
fall into the blue one again alright get
move don't go far enough
ah yeah power and stabilization no don't
go in the red red thanks is back there
now there one cuz that just takes us
back to where we were this thing we
learned see we learn to think yeah but
we yes we did but we don't want to go
there yet I know that oh my god straight
down
okay we're now in jalopy mode old jalopy
enables something else we need to hit I
don't know what it is but I think we
need to go back over dere
go back to red and that oh yeah that
opened that up now all right normal
engines please and stabilize okay all
right okay you know what hold on this is
moving you like trick engines are a lot
smoother zero normal normal yeah or at
least the rest for opinion yeah use
here's nice smooth electric power no
electric J we are now running Prius up
in here no we're not Prius because we go
pretty fast
we're running Tesla up in here shit huh
and jalopy Oh
- jalopy oh I hate jalopy
Oh God fool jalopy you know what I have
not tried 5-hour energy lately last time
I did 5-hour energy I was at a bachelor
party and we were drinking it all night
to make it to the strip clubs and
whatnot and and it messed up my brain up
too much it works very well so I know I
don't do 5-hour energy anymore
I'm gonna run out of juice hold on your
controller balls from D machine
it was at a full charge by the way when
we started screaming that's how long the
the gamepad oh really
about two hours yep two hours of solid
play hold on
plugging in plugging in comes of in
terms of a nice long power cable should
plugged in oh my god and kill all my
power
apparently yeah bow-bow okay that is an
electricity and heat monster something
that's like slide well this worse
oh yeah oh we got a slide and shoot I
think there's a button above it
Wow is it big slide all right nice one
sliders on ready to aim yeah yeah me
wait wait give me uh some momentum some
more thrust
yeah thrust up all right we thought I
like that yep it's okay try again I
think we need to go a little faster
thrust up
all right
all right and we're going okay yeah you
you think that's weird
oh that was weird that was a weird noise
clinking it was a public we had already
done yeah it away
I wonder if they running out of things
or if that was like the prelude to like
big but I wonder what the boss fight in
this game is I don't know that's what I
really wonder
Jaken well you can get high-capacity
batteries for the Wii U gamepad oh
that's good
that's nice when you have to buy
something extra you know you know for
moderate functionality I mean you
oh I know you know yeah yes you did you
totally oh we still had our sliders on -
back on
don't just fire flares at it
okay scanning that is an electricity
monster so we should be able to actually
just cool down our thrust and our
decelerator Tron and our scanner now you
should be able to get by it no oh no
just just be cool old slide past it or
we'll just slide past it yeah
sliders on
what a SAP suck no no oh wait all right
there we're getting ready for something
yes this is easy this is like it just a
reminder of all this yeah
that is it everything monster literally
everything so now if we have any sense
you have to break it almost no wait if
we have any sound or electricity like I
need to turn the scanner off there's the
button off there where top top alright
you can watch it right now there's a
button up there there's a button up
there oh okay I think so if we slide
past it and try to stop right under and
now it's a weird angle where's our way
around if we turn out huh oh you tell me
what to do
oh oh I see it what here's the thing
that we did we have no we can't have
anything we can't have anything on how
do we do this
it's our way around
oh yeah
all right ready yeah No
right
huh
I said it's lightning
oh well I'm gonna try and see what
happens the worst that can happen is if
we get struck by lightning I can't even
tell from moving alright alright
where you get through yep
it's like
alright sup shoot okay ready shoots
shoot
no that's open already kill Stan so what
my guess is sticky right before the
laser oh that's how we do okay so but we
need enough momentum to get past it
so I think we need to like shoot up here
okay zoom past it
turn off engines and sticky let me just
sticky
that's slide okay Fred sticky huh right
too sticky
see he's easy okay
the stinky two slide is easy the thing
that's gonna suck is like like oh I can
just keep that there I can keep it like
in a neutral place and so you'll just
have to time your shot okay well it's
always the quick engine cut - yeah
there's always a quick engine cut
already oh it comes right back up I
didn't know comes right back that's all
right that's all right that we had time
doing extra momentum oh we're back here
yeah oh but actually no we can't do that
because the scanner needs to be off we
can have no
let's just try going in there and
turning the scanner on okay
sliders are on okay let's try that again
no I don't think again is going to work
it just ate us Jack hmm you want to
train again all right I just want to see
if the landing gear takes any power no
it does not yeah what's right of you all
right
give me I'm gonna I'm gonna go huh I'm
just gonna go on the count of three one
two three
/ I'm somebody huh its proximity I think
it hears us I think it makes a sound I
think we're making a sound in we slide
no I I may be yet because that that
thing is 100 percent sound heat and
electricity all right
maybe even if I cut her into sliding
make noise huh
the sliding make noise I don't know
Justin I don't sliders iron
now that make noise enough oh wait we
have soft we have soft landing gear
wait you have soft um no no we have soft
landing gear so we just need the land in
the right spot and the soft huh so we
just need the land in the right spot
if it is indeed the sound that's setting
it off I'm not convinced I have no idea
I don't think that's it jack okay what
do you got
what do you want what do you need this
button over the door was that what that
but yeah you'd have been like the door
that was right here
bullets for tracer steps okay
sliders on
came out that
I think it looks like a boob so we got
that going for us and then we got murky
we got Marquis boob underneath oh maybe
there was a secret no all right all
right
ready to sled ready all right cut it out
back on I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot in
the face oh oh you got him move a little
bit
okay I gotta chew the button the button
the button well not yet let's go closer
oh wait can we're gonna wear it out
laser her oh my god rich
she's puppy
headshot I'm gonna imagine the laser
won't kill him we probably just need to
get them past us and then go around yeah
funny tricky thing will be getting past
that yeah
oh it's okay you scan him we can see
like how far we got oh fuck
scan him again
shoot him hey yeah it's out of here fuck
I didn't know he give lunch he lunges
alright we know we're doing what all
we're doing I know and we're a career no
grab blown out panic good fight around
do you wish she'd move a little faster
can you just keep shooting him
oh I don't know true I don't like your
don't like it okay
as long as we can make it through
I don't think this is what the
corporation had a time when it said like
don't get us through oh my god I can hit
him myself ladies
slide these are active I think wait till
he touches the line
okay now do it alright no damn it
okay so it's asked me before he gets to
that second line around
our range we gotta go
we have a decent rant oh I'm not as
worried cause I smell good
this caddy yeah this is an interesting
uh that was a nice little brain puzzle
but it's a little boss
you're right this game doesn't need more
hotdogs it's just in general
I think but I think every game needs
more hot dogs there's not enough hot
dogs and games
I am ready tell me one now
are you saving back quick go get him all
right slide no bullshit
what was that Jack what was he doing it
was heading where this didn't sound like
he was heading back no oh it sound like
I take your word on it all right
it sounded it sounded like he was it's
all right it's all right rich it sounded
like you in fact it's fine
is it it's not fine just be time we've
done this keep that still get our
sliders on ready to power that engine
you just keep shooting I'll tell my
hamburger story an amazing start today I
ate a hamburger for lunch that might
have wrecked my very soul there's a
hamburger a new hamburger place in in
the Greater Milwaukee area that my
brother took me to and my brother likes
eating gross and giant ridiculous food
so we went to this hamburger place and
they make funny special hamburgers not
funny like you know interesting weird
hamburgers and so I decided to eat the
most interesting thing I could find on
the menu that hamburger was the peanut
butter jalapeno bacon hamburgers that's
fucking disgusting
yeah I ready with the slide I'm ready
now
and yes by the way it was fucking
disgusting no I actually was great not
great it was interesting it was it was
it was unique not necessarily a burger I
would want to eat all of the time but
you know it was an interesting flavor
palette and you know I probably would
not eat it again but it was giant and
you know you have it with french fries
and they also had a giant golf
ball-sized cheese curds and if you don't
know what a cheese curd is this might be
a Wisconsin thing a cheese curd is
literally just a hunk of cheese that is
deep-fried that's it that's all it is a
hunk of cheese that is deep-fried and
and I just ate way too much for lunch it
was creamy peanut butter for those
asking creamy peanut butter
what was your blood-alcohol level 0 I we
were working we had a shoot this morning
and we stopped for lunch after the shoot
and I should know better than going out
to lunch with my brother because he
likes to eat weird things
I'm parking to get him up all right that
seems to be it
ready I'm ready to go you're going in

hold the phone the email about the
stream went out 20 minutes ago is that
true Tiberius Kirk well I'm very sorry
yeah we've been at it since seven yeah
well seven thirteen thirteen seven
thirteen so that's that's close to the
three hour stream cue you texted me
something rich oh I'm just checking the
time did you but text about texted you
rich but texted me the letter Q so I
think he was trying to send me a secret
code for couette or maybe he was calling
me a cutie but forgot the T so thank you
rich I'll take that do I have to give
you a reach-around
no I Arkham stream before they hear that
oh that's right Colonel rich mustard
someone someone tweeted me a good idea
that is gonna be a bit of an undertaking
but it will happen
Colonel rich mustard I got I got a tweet
today we got a tweet today I say we got
a tweet cuz previously recorded against
me but I checked that Twitter yeah and I
came up with a really good idea which is
they needed to know what games we
already own on Steam and GOG okay
because they didn't want to give this
duplicate copies yeah and so what I want
to create is another awesome spreadsheet
okay of games that we own on Steam G and
Gog and other formats to eventually
write so that for people who don't feel
like gifting us something can can feel
you know good and knowing that they're
giving us a new game something we don't
already have so yes we will get on that
it will be a slow process but what I'll
do is I'll make a I'll make a G a Google
Docs spreadsheet and just make it public
and we'll find a place to post that
somewhere yeah we'll post that somewhere
so then if you want to if you want to
see it you can reference the public
Google Docs of our spreadsheet and we'll
find a way to like cross out stuff so
that'll be great that sounds like a
great idea yes yeah leftover beefcake I
will make that available on Google Drive
so then you know we can cross off games
that we've already played and you can
see all the games we own and on all the
formats
I'm really sorry everybody who just got
apparently people are just getting the
email god you gotta check the twits you
gotta check the tweets why would the
