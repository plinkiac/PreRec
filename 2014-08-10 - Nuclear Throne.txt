[Part I]
Rory Tate thank you thank you for them
welcome
I'm gonna get nuclear throne set up here
I didn't really know what to play today
and so I decided oh
it's I really wanted to get into this
game but last time we tried to play it
didn't because
handsome
the answer that hold on
we are getting that hope yep see it's
going all over the place for you guys
here's that
I get a new one last time we tried to
play this we couldn't because we're
having a mass audio issues
and now we are known now we need a game
capture their throne there she is
there she
as if
there is ok now we are getting some
nuclear ground a game that I'm very
excited about
yes pour yourself pour yourself a snack
rogue legacy I do want to talk a little
bit while I'm playing nuclear well I
would like to
turn down the game audio and for what I
hear that I can hear that how's that
tell me if that is manageable and clear
throne is pretty loud there we go
is that manageable never wrong you got
it jack snacks already excellent whiskey
is a great Jack's neck
I as always I'm pouring out of my last
hop freak of the weekend
broy
you might have heard a tiny sneeze I
just got a cat
and it's at my feet and I'm not sure not
sure if I like it or not we're gonna you
know we're gonna figure that out
music falling down here there you go
that is that would that would've been
good to know we do 19 controller support
controls gamepad on
here we go here we go jackets
oh man you guys had a poll I can't um a
beard oh you know I've been thinking
about that I came close recently came
close to full beard then I shaved I
shaved because we were recording more
Mario Kart footage let's just go kind of
go fish here
okay so left trigger roll
and Rahl seems to be important right
trigger shoot and twin-stick saying so
you know what I said
pretty easy twin-stick shooter fun model
world that seemed like it was something
i don't know anything about this game is
something you should know
machine gun seems like something I want
yep by the way the enthusiast whoa
nope great oh I probably wanted that
level of resistance right men of rupes
in this game I totally agree everyone
how's how's the audio sound well
actually I have another way to check all
right I'm gonna check myself
okay that sounds pretty good and that
sounds good okay here we go
don't know where my camera there it is
there he is I shouldn't demoralize them
by calling it an it
I think we're gonna call him princess
meatball because he seems very
persnickety
and he's large he's like a 20-pound cat
so Princess meatball it makes sense in
my head
sledgehammer yes
not as good as a gun gonna gonna be
honest but no oh wait that wanted to see
what else there was okay so you're
saying he's a cat yes he is a cat what
platforms are es Rory Tate asked what
platform this is on this is a right now
PC only and I want to say it's Windows
only I believe there is talk of this
coming to PlayStation 4 and and Xbox
it's one of those it's one of those
indie games that I'm sure will
eventually make it to home like oh my
sledgehammer was a bad idea how do we
change weapons
oh my god
I changed weapons somehow he took money
to learn how to play this game I think
before I play it air hold on let's
now you get up to
No
you know
so the question is if you have a
controller how do you get up to the
options
you know what I just did I just did
escape we're gonna try that again
actually yeah you should see in a second
how do you do that
I don't know how to play the game is my
problem in horizon I just saw as I saw
this game and realize that I wanted to
play it because I've really enjoyed
twin-stick shooters and I really enjoy
procedurally generated levels and
roguelikes
where you only get one life to live them
and so this and that's what this game is
twin-stick shooter procedurally
generated levels and one life to live
crossbow yeah oh my god this is awesome
ahh I don't necessarily know yeah oh no
oh ok I don't know anything about this
game ok I just figured something out
guys oh my god I figured out I was
terrible I'm
I figured out how to switch between
weapons which is frankly very important
shotgun always always choose shotgun
shotgun crossbow combo always choose
shotgun oh this crossbow some wicked not
gonna lie I feel
feel really good about one-shot kills
bet it help no I don't do something yes
Marie today we got new we got new Jack
emoticons I also I submitted fuck bought
5,000 emoticons but I actually wrote
fuck bought 5,000 on his little robot
chest and so they they denied it because
they could read the f-word so that's
twitch Bram which is fine so basically
I'm just gonna remake it and remove that
word from from the chefs so it's very
soon probably tomorrow there will be a
too much too much there will be a fuck
bot how do we play the water
although the Sun that's not an ambition
that's just help guys I'm pretty long
here
oh I'll help packs what turn down for
what
hey yeah yeah yeah it is great I really
like this crossbow so I'm gonna stick
with it I wish I could pick up my bolts
though scorpion nope nope that's just
sexy right it getting better already
so once we get so so my face and fuck
about five thousand where our last two
emoticons and then once we've reached
100 subscribers I get two more
so then possibly a smirking Jesus oh my
god
this is crazy
I need to remember my role maneuver
yeah I know I know it tells me I blow HP
as if I didn't already know that
need that help back me that prospect
Burma
triple machine-gun that seems like
something you want okay I have an
assault Slugger and a triple machine gun
I'm feeling pretty good about this run
and this is me knowing nothing about
these runs I just want to let you know
that oh my gosh sorry I was reading the
chat and
and million things I don't even know
what these things are that I'm
collecting I know nothing about this
I know that I bet I died I did not reach
the nuclear throne that's great that's
great I feel really good about this
watch out for snipers
leadbottom Petite Mort I don't know that
means buddy we got some different guys
here more HP Crystal shield telekinesis
season the dark less HP more XP
explosive revenge faster try this guy
crystal he's a crystal guy
I just realized that these are like my
shelves that I'm like I shoot in these
little yellow things are my bullet
shells and I kind of love that not gonna
live sledge hammer I'm not gonna fall
for it this time
well jammer is an impulse buying
and I regret immediately these little
green things serve some phone okay those
is the things I need to look for these
little on green jams on every level so
explore before killing the last guy
that's my
that's my objective
slugger absolutely
to
right
yeah this is just like basically every
great indie game everywhere it's like
kind of that indie game of the indie
game ideas of the day where all the
light sources really generated levels
killer soundtrack really digging the
soundtrack
and meet visual style I mean I have a
grenade launcher as far as I'm concerned
okay so if I came from the distance I
can don't get sucked into the portal
that's good to know I know what that
means
I've tried pressing other buttons and
see what happens
so right now if you press Y you change
water
change or can you have
totally hit him
haha that's tough you guys I hear him
the little white lips but it's pretty
awesome really like that crossbow only
14 bolts don't like that and I would
rather have grenades you know like that
I just like that laser sight that was
hot
great there we go okay extreme like
crazy task City absolutely I will
absolutely shrimp more crazy sexy that
was a really fun stream the craziest
axis dream the will do another will do
another Dreamcast ring I think because
we had a lot of fun doing that okay
oh wow let's try him sees in the dark
telekinesis you know I didn't even try
my crystal shield so telekinesis does
I don't know what telekinesis does I
know I can blow up barrels
I would kind of like to know what
telekinesis does
nope been there that is there that is
more extremist jesse the profanity queen
absolutely
jesse is a joy and the treatment always
and especially when she's cussing
take anything slow and steady
slow and steady
in a better gun here Oh No Oh
this rabbit paws more item drops racing
line kills lowering a reload time oh
yeah that's what I want
while I send to bhp
the last does no I do not want to play
the last of us
hmm okay let's see here so that was this
guy I'm melting
let's say to be more xB most of revenge
alright let's see what this guy is
and the votes oh my god I only have two
hits
yes place your pistol
whoa Anatolia
I apologize for my lack of talking
during this dream but I'm very
enthralled with this game right now
I do be like I want to talk in general
about some stuff I really want to talk
about how I have not been oh that's what
I said I was gonna talk about rogue
legacy and how overall I have not super
been into rogue legacy I find that rogue
legacy is a roguelike game that does its
best to minimize all the roguelike
elements finest game absolutely nice you
know for example of randomly generated
levels is a thing now but and rogue
legacy you can lock down the castle as
we learn to get rid of
to get rid of randomly generated levels
and in fact we want to do that more
often than not especially when fighting
the main bad guys it makes it for much
easier much easier fight okay
and then you know the whole leveling up
thing it out a lot of people a lot of
rogue legacy feels like a grind to me
you know just grind in four levels grind
it for money so you can so you can get
that extra level
oh I got greedy yeah it's a rogue
simulator you know it's it's one of
those things where I I went in looking
for another spelunky you know kind of
looking for a spelunky with more action
than exploration and what I'm getting is
a really decent action platformer that
doesn't need to be called a roguelike
snare growth
plans is fast you know like if it was
just uh
if it was just like you know simple
action-platformer I would not be having
any of these problems because I go in
expecting a simple action-platformer you
know
this doesn't say
still turning out
- Anatomy their ceiling I mean but
because I went in expecting spelunky I
got incredibly disappointed because the
grind didn't because you can lock down
the castle because you have to lock down
the castle and you know I know you get
achievements if you can get through the
entire thing without locking down the
castle but then you still have been
grinding over the leveling up be upping
your attack yeah here you know you can
up for your attack and defense then I
think if there's any of the RPG issue
elements
so there's a lot that I'm actually a
little oh no good no good I go there's a
lot that I'm actually a little
disappointed with
she'll bounce five yeah it's great
I already uh I did forget to lock down
the castle marks either you're right no
and it you know it's a it's a really
good game it's it's actually it's just
one of those it's one of those
expectation things where where I
expected
I moved my chair and thought that I ran
over my can I'm still not used to having
a cat it's it's an expectation thing I
ran a fire pup I get to be a triangle
because I was expecting
bastards because I was expecting
spelunky or binding of issac I'm
disappointed the Hat I've been expecting
something else I feel like I would have
really enjoyed I would have enjoyed the
game a lot more and that's it you know
along those lines
would you guys like to talk about
guardians of the galaxy because I have
some stuff I'd like to get up much of
this about guardians of the galaxy
mostly me not liking it very much and
that's you know that's a little
hyperbole I liked it fine Oh sir campy
hey sir give you by the way I don't know
if I said hi so we're gonna be our one
and only line I will talk about the
backlash to our Sonic review absolutely
but I was just about to segue into
guardians of the galaxy
and I will try not to go into spoiler
territory for anyone's you have to see
it but I much along the same lines of
being disappointed by nuclear from which
is a fine game I was a little
disappointed by guardians of the galaxy
I went in expecting Avengers you know
expecting kind of bit action greatness
and it's just an OK
and actually I disagree you know I find
as far as agreeing with Jan Mike
I usually oh my god jesus H Christ I
usually find that I agree with Mike
Martin and Mike was a little more
middling towards the movie than Jay was
Dave really likes Guardians but the heat
Jays also big James Gunn fan so that
makes sense
my the Buddha movie stops the movie
stops often the dead in his tracks and a
gun and chin gun
double machine gun yes yes
there is some really weak
there's some really weak
characterization and a ton of towel
don't show in guardians of the galaxy so
many especially characterization moments
in which like it's basically how we've
been friends forever haven't we and I
remember five years ago man we're good
friends Max gotta go stronger attack
power time some kills regenerate ammo
damage taken is still - all enemies on
screen better accuracy of course
forget that have a machine-gun now just
hold it down down
what there was something behind me oh
you did this thing I must kill you check
arrhythmia be sorry no no I and I don't
like this is the thing about this is the
thing about heist inflames this is the
thing about all the the entire movie I'm
talking about
along the same lines of nuclear throne
which is it's a fine movie and guardians
of the galaxy is super fun it's it's one
of the funniest Marvel movies out there
we all laughed
a ton in the theater and you know I saw
it with rich Jesse Mike and Jane and
everyone was laughing it was super funny
it was just weak on some of the
fundamentals specifically the the towel
don't show aspect of it to where the
movie the movie would just stop every
once in a while
explain who a character is and what
their motivation was and then they would
get going again it was a ton of payoff
and no setup but it was still a really
fun and I would call it a good movie but
I was expecting better accurate
sure let's see what this does
oh my god what am I
not falling for it this time making sure
there's no behind me this
this is pretty awesome
Oh
I kind of use the same I use the same
ball Pole anyway I do look like a
testicle you're absolutely right be a
litlle B or whatever your name is
whoa whoa whoa shooting at me
stop it
I do feel I feel really good about like
the use of cover in this this is pretty
awesome get out of here
get out of here Oh I need all these
things I'm sure yes yes um a screwdriver
for this can you believe that
who would want a screwdriver over a
laser pistol so yeah it's just it's one
of those things where I like I
definitely hi what was really funny to
me was rich and I felt very similar
about guardians of the galaxy and Mike
and Jay felt very different and rich
and I have a comic book people and so
the comic book fate people felt very
different than them all got to do
stronger attack power so so I thought
that was really very interesting I don't
know what that necessarily says about
our positions but rich and I definitely
were on the same page and Michael jr.
were more on the same page J more so
than anyway I'm staying really loved
which you know at times he gets to
I might - oh my god
he can do that he can do that
good jesus H Christ
I don't want to fight anymore damn it
just leave me alone fine small I don't
want a nuclear Iran anymore I just want
to regulate from you make your little
black hole no I'm not gonna kill them
hello what Oh son of a bitch um music
change basta have confirmed I can't fire
both why because that once dick to
birthday ball you're right that was my
special ability oh I forgot about his
special ability it's a fire both weapons
at once
this is fun this actually might just be
a little - this might be a little too
fast pace for me this might be a little
too hard for me but any case that kind
of wraps it up for the the guardians of
the galaxy without going into terrible
spoiler warnings I think eventually when
we do a group stream we'll have a group
conversation about it eats guns all
right this let's see what eating again
this does I'm sure it gives you the
health back
they edit it and that's the kind of the
same I've been feeling about nuclear
throne where it's it's a fine game
I'm just not and I'm into it like I've
been playing it I've been enjoying it
but I feel like I'm missing something
because I signed up for a road bike and
it's not one
smoke oh come on
Oh eat my sledgehammer get bullets I
will take out
yeah
hi yes a tiny nuclear throne nuclear
throne
great these cover these covered
both gun
oh my god no that's not a boson that's a
chainsaw gun sounds great
dun dun dun you know twitchplayspokemon
I don't think roguelike are you really
touched by Pokemon congratulations I
don't think roguelike has been abused I
think the definition of roguelike has
evolved with the time and I think that's
fine you know this has roguelike
elements it's nothing like the game room
but the definition can evolve as long as
it's not as dumb as what was the thing
is one of now one of the definitions of
literally is not literally that's just
dumb I think we can all agree on that
okay what do I want here laser brain
energy weapons deal more damage I
haven't I have a laser weapon
oh I don't have to let energy weapon
this is not good just not enough ammo
but I'll just use this here and get my
good mech boss battle nice nice I'm
gonna get my gun back there we go
nope you little bugger I'm not even a
deal with you I'm gonna go look for here
I just want you
Vanier oh my god
I got mega gel so the Marla story is
it's perfectly okay for the definition
of things to evolve over time meet a D&D;
friend television
mainly range second stomach can always
be for medkits oh yeah we got fun want
that so now I will talk now I will talk
about our wonderful backlash from the
sonic review is I thought we did a good
job of explaining ourselves
apparently we did not
Oh awesome enemies awesome animals
opossum is gonna die oh my god
because the the real problem as far as
I'm concerned is people saying that we
didn't play it right that's my favorite
you guys just didn't play it right well
first of all you know funky we
absolutely played it right and we we
showed our work you know we we said that
going fast her to you and then we showed
how going fast can hurt you
like an eagle that's right I can I can
eat guns I'm gonna eat this gun for more
bullets
there we go great
so that's my biggest problem is oh my oh
my god what is that a car that's awesome
that might hurt doing that
great and then I'm gonna before so shit
shit
so we show don't work it hurts you to
play Sonic fast we showing ourselves
getting hurt playing sign it fast well
you guys just didn't play right if a
game is that specific
get out here get out of here oh my god
okay eat it
eat it eat it
eat it yes men good eat it man oh my god
triple machine-gun yes oh my god take it
take it
nope nope don't like that at all
whatever that is good
great this gun can hurt you and ricochet
I assumed were suffice it like I know it
would we didn't you know like I'm not
saying that it's the worst game ever and
and if you remember my conclusion my
hypothesis that Sonic is the most
overrated game ever and Sonic as a
character deserves no place in gaming
history was proven false because he does
deserve a place in gaming history
because he was the mascot of the Genesis
and the Genesis deserves recognition
therefore Sonic is the genesis the Sonic
games yes I believe are fundamentally
flawed because they have a character
design and level design that wants you
to go fast but going fast hurts you so
the very nature of the game is
counterintuitive and it's frustrating I
tried my best to show our work and I
think I did and so that's the the
upsetting part is is how people can
still say we played it bad tiger attack
top attract power ok go slower
in boats they've damaged hunger track
powers I think would be helpful
all obeys police there's police what
what what
what am I supposed to do here did I do
good didn't consider you good
dick the birthday boy hold on dick the
birthday boy says keep in mind this is
from the team who never used rocket
jumps or wall running and titanfall we
absolutely did titanfall is a this fine
game it's perfectly C+ we did we just
didn't show it because I had to cut it
from the episode
oh my god what is this
it
oh my god
bigger explosions
pickups pay fast but I'm worth more oh
my god no ammo drops more weapon drops
nation over time or enemies
weapon per portal extra chests
yes
oh my god
she's sweet she's bright
out of here
they do it schedule it know what what
what did I well I guess when he blows up
C+ is average yes it was a perfectly
average game titanfall
and so you know it was just it was just
there was nothing special about
titanfall which was our conclusion it
was fine rich didn't like it because he
doesn't like multiplayer on the games
and that's his that's his issues am you
know and you know I wanted to keep his
opinion in every cuz rich on are
different gamers I like multiplayer on
the games and I had a lot of fun I
didn't have a lot of investment in the
game is my jimJam hard to kill
slow-motion yeah let's give this chicken
a try my chicken y'all
oh I'm uninjured chicken I have a sword
I'm gonna be honest I feel a little
awesome look at this Oh Oh YUM
you got you another I'm not killing you
because I want that chest deal laser
pistol you don't mind if I do
melee to flex her stops of bullets is
that true
I'll see if we can test this out Jimmy
oh my god that's true
this deflects this kind of oil
it does oh my god yeah
yeah I knew that so I want to place the
chicken again what idea
totally broker named you to quit all
right broke the game that's what happens
I think nuclear throne is act is still
in beta right I think so I don't know
also if we address that I can't get to
the options menu while using a
controller
okay let's view the chicken again let's
read it again again yeah so yet I'll try
try to line
a lot of sonic backlash but you know
what and the the really funny thing is
oh no he didn't hit me
alright the really funny thing is how
everyone was commenting on the clickbait
meanness of the episode which fair
enough it absolutely is a clickbait
episode that was not the intent and
making the episode like this was just
one that we wanted to make you know
where's my source not here
longer sword
also I made a little joke about the
clickbait eNOS of the episode and still
people were like this quickvid garbage
that's why I make the jokey oh I know
it's a clickbait also I mean him work
god did very well I wish
you take a ticket there yes got it
mo max no damage from explosions when
number kids percent out bats that could
be good to have do that let's do that
because I might my guess is that I will
be okay what well there's a little slug
guy now there's some one guy
I have to remember that my sword into
flex bullets
hey we got there we go there we go well
that's like but this is boss music now I
remember I wrote a series oh my oh my
god he killed me something good it may
have been unfair to complain about input
lag when playing a game designs were
played on his ear to ear there's
something significantly lag here 220
spoke what are you talking about input
lag are you talking about the the sonic
episode
if so we there was there was absolutely
no complaining about impo lag in the
sonic episode it was it was a question
of do you yeah okay great
yeah no that it wasn't that it was it
was a question of do you have time to
react to the enemies on screen and the
answer was no if you were going fast
enough you did not no matter the TV and
you know we were still playing on on an
original Genesis so if anything we
should have had more time right we were
getting the same frames per second the
game is best when played slow and
careful I think anyone will agree with
that you need to slow down to see when
the enemies are happening the only
problem is Sonic wants to go fast and
the levels want you to go fast input
there but there was no input lag what
what could be the difference going from
going from a Genesis to a CRT TV to an
HDTV explain explain yourself
twitchplayspokemon give me your business
you've got to go fast that's right
that's my thing about Sonic is it
doesn't want you to go fast unless
you're on Rails and and on any of the on
rail section yeah you go that fast as
you want super fun HD video spent time
processing the signal doing analog to
digital conversion and other filtering
hmm I wonder if that was as some of the
case I guess I did not know we were we
were sending our signal through our
capture device we have a whole pub or
however you send it and and then sending
that oh no actually we were just
splitting we were just splitting the
signal
so if twitchplayspokemon is correct and
let's assume he/she is because they are
twitchplayspokemon there there's a bit
of an input lag converting a standard
definition RCA input to an HD television
if that's the case we might have to
backtrack on this and find an old CRT TV
and replay in blood that's the thing
Rory day we were playing
twitchplayspokemon is backpedaling
definitely prefer mark everyone prefers
Mara but the good the question is
whether or not Sonic is a good game and
I don't think it is that's actually the
dough now I do want to do a little more
homework to see
I mean but we're talking about fractions
of micros microns of seconds right I
want to play the chicken again I'm
really enjoying playing as the chicken
because you get a sword yo ya feel like
Kill Bill I know that's not earning I
feel like the bride

can kill people have to do that if you
get a chicken all right I got stopping
the chicken let's see what else we got
here
ah here we go here we go
what's this place it's oh my god yeah no
I like you were twitchplayspokemon is
correct if if we did not account for lag
time to process the signal that debunks
I mean 98% of our argument I'm you know
so the question is if if that was true
if our TV was having that kind of input
lag how much wasn't and how much did it
affect the game
these are the questions you know these
are the questions
I'm or titanfall backlash
right
it's again well candy smack that's the
that was the whole thing
this was the whole start of the episode
is everyone still talks about Sonic the
Hedgehog
that's a fire as HP gets lower will help
traction power and traction power
okay this this was my whole thing I did
not understand why Sonic was a big deal
because I always hated it and so I
wanted to as an adult gamer as someone
who games I wanted to go back
nope nope not even not even close did we
do this who would possibly care this
much about Sonic I have received it so
much hate after the sonic episode you
have no idea
let's do random let's do random not
gonna prom yeah there
take a break a little bit
nice nice one plus the help why don't
you I don't even know where I'm losing
these health points I'll be honest I do
obviously I'm sure I am

two HP

I'm just getting trapped in this corner
here better work ese well I will take it
it's a dick move
it's a dick move but I'll take it
cuz it's a winning move got a game the
game help
there we go SMG okay I see hiccups fine
a narc a slower reload time better
accuracy melee range I don't have a
melee weapon let's go for better
accuracy why not because why not
by the way that kills you that green gas
tactics are not take remove if they work
right no I know it's just you know you
feel a little I feel a little bit ok you
know we're gonna do we're gonna take a
little break we're about we're at about

material to talk just about Mario Kart 8
and so we actually we went back and have
played all of the Mario karts I got my
old Super Nintendo out
we got the n64 which if any of you guys
saw the n64 stream we were playing
gamecube before doing so all of them
except for the ds1 all of them except
for the handhelds we're gonna be the
chicken again
so tomorrow we're gonna play a game cube
and the wee one
let's do the chicken let's go down time
oh we're gonna add
I should
I dunno how long it lasts can you just
do this forever you can't that's really
funny obviously didn't help much fun now
that I know that so so yeah tomorrow I'm
going into the studio we're finishing up
the the gameplay segments and having our
discussion on Mario on Mario Kart as a
series not just Mario Kart 8 you know
it'll be all wrapped around Mario Kart 8
but just as Mario Kart series what the
fuck hit me I do just want to play the
whole game in slow motion now
nice
I mean kind of a wasting bolt but no I'm
good you know what I'm gonna be fine
with it I'm gonna be fine with it
I'm not giving up my sword
of bitches in there
that's this is dumb this is dumb font
right here
oh my god that was great
right okay we're worried
never gots place for my resume our carts
a really really interesting game you
know obviously first in the series just
so different so different than
everything else that came after it as
soon as mario kart 64 hit you can
clearly tell
some kills were generate animal
why not you can clearly tell where they
were going but yeah it's the Super Mario
Kart
I got a backup cuz he explodes just
gonna fill this guy nice nice
I mean is this terrible just playing the
whole game in slow motion yeah that's I
know what I feel like doing here
a shovel we could be shoveling I mean of
course I'm gonna be telling
oh my god yes oh I have to remember I
can deflect that shit sorry
concentrating here here get out of here
boom easy okay great

when we had our amazing FTL run I'm so
close head let's become a no okay get
full health and some ammo
yes yes we want full health and some
ammo
I'm a little disheartened after our last
FCL run that was so good oh this has a
for-real cooldown time I'm starting to
see I'm now starting to take notice of
like shovel cooldown time
and your text
here taxi
don't don't touch that that RJ
he proceeds to touch it
okay I'm playing it cool yo I'm playing
it cool yo yo
hahaha
sneaking sneaking and rats
uh chicken chickens the only way to be
oh my god I can't believe I'm missing
oh my god well that's a new one
oh oh they gonna kill you those can kill
you guys any more word on playing Mario
Kart for the stream oh you know what you
know what would be a good topic of
conversation here ton of people have
been talking to me about Twitch's new
rules this is going to eventually fold
back to Mario Kart I swear you know
twitch recently changed there a couple
of their video on-demand policies and
how they handle some copyrighted music
claims copy written music lanes or
however you say it so from now on you
don't get as much time to have past
broadcasts you have to turn them into
highlights and you can keep highlights
for a long time and of course I Eve move
highlights over to our YouTube channel
which everyone can and should do because
YouTube is a fine system but also
they're implementing audio recognition
software to recognize copy written audio
material which will be automatically
muted for the videos on demand for those
highlights alright we're not gonna be
the chickens around let's just be the
fish he's gotta roll
he's got a roll you which you know for
me it doesn't affect me all that much
because we don't often play tap here
with music but what could be the case
and what has been the case for some
streamers is of course copy written game
music and that game music being muted
and then possibly not being able to
monetize that in the future which brings
us to that I get that oh good which
brings us to Mario Kart I the reason I'm
not worried about this and I've been a
video producer for so long that these
kind of things don't really bother me
the gaming producers don't yet realize
the asset that twitches that gameplay
videos are and so they're trying to shut
it down as if it's hurting their sales
but actually we're showing people the
game if anything you know we were
helping sell games if it's a good game
of course I know a ton of you have said
that you got XCOM after we played XCOM a
ton of you have said you've won get got
at siela through play that hopefully
you're seeing this and thinking it's a
really neat-looking game and you'll go
and look into nuclear throne what is
going to end up happening is streamers
and video producers will stop streaming
and producing content that gets them
flagged for copyright and content that
they can't monetize for example we
probably won't do another mario kart 8
stream because we are unable to monetize
that when when we uploaded it to youtube
that got flagged for audio content so
we're not able to monetize that or the
new Super Mario Brothers stuff and
that's really bad because there's a fun
game and I would love to stream that
again just because I really enjoy Mario
Kart the series especially Mario Kart 8
spoiler alert for the
you bunt we're probably not going to
know stream that because it means less
revenue coming in for us so that means
less publicity for that game we're gonna
stream other games so I think hopefully
hope is as as far as I'm concerned is
that it will work itself out people want
to play those games they won't get the
the sales boost that they were hoping
for and publishers won't realize their
mistake that's what I'm all before game
producers are grumpy old men so that
that's that's the thing you but if you
buzzer Nick never a jerk great that's
great
you bought shovel knights geeks Onan
that's great like and that's what's
gonna happen is people shall launch
father kills low reloads I'm sure people
are going to end up streaming these
indie games because they know that indie
games aren't gonna screw them on the
monetization project which means indie
games are gonna continue to get more
love on the streamer circuit which is
great
and hopefully the big publishers will
just realize what's going on in time
where these you know like if you stream
a movie yeah you're ruining this the
cell ability of that movie for future
audience absolutely
but these aren't movie these are games
you know you have to play them yourself
to enjoy them fully
yeah yeah I didn't get the barrel yo you
bought your we you after watching people
play my card in here so this is the
thing you Bob mr. mosquito you did not
you are alive you don't be a liar
or do I don't care
oh my god this thing let's create it
down
jesus H Christ getcha getcha not doing
terribly well not doing terribly well I
have not fully committed to this game
yet I don't understand the delicate
intricacies and I want that I know with
that bottle that bottled those good
things there we go
the delicate interest see cos Oh dick
the birthday boy a heavy red wool yet
for anyone who hasn't read wool yet
get your ass a digital copy of wool one
of the best books I've read until so
long I'm waiting for your response dick
the birthday boy did you read a ball
a official prereqs team account that you
can all buy games for um maybe well
we'll look into that
Jack talking about well I'm gonna start
talking about wall that book is so
fucking good not yet that's alright
that's alright because you know what you
need a couple days because once you
start reading it you're not gonna put it
down Louis lower enemy bullets that's
what I want I want slower enemy bullets
don't touch the green gas that's what I
learned
oh my god this thing eats through
bullets I suppose it's a triple machine
gun really should have paid more
attention
got more times good more times couple or
games gonna be fishing it fishes fishes
Demario fishes the balance
I'm not and I'm not utilizing my role I
feel like but I also don't see a purpose
you know I can run faster than most of
the bullets I'm sure I'm sure later in
the game it becomes very important to
master the role
yeah yeah you do that's not oh my god
I was not prepared I keep thinking I
keep thinking of and a mindset of
binding of issac where after you defeat
a room you have infinity to move to the
next room before you have to worry about
you know animes and whatnot this this
kind of moves you along this moves you
along so you gotta you have to pay
attention and I have you not been paying
attention
Sen Tian yes if they want SMG
stellen both gun crossbow
which is very handy when the boss the
big boss comes gotta go
what geeks only I have according to
Jessie no joke resumes have come in yet
I'm going in tomorrow and I'm damn well
better see some joke resumes stronger
track powers

more f2 y'all welcome you guys tell me
and once I'm done here I'll ask you
whether you want Isaac or FTL well we'll
make that call don't make that call when
it's time to make that call Isaac or FTL
you know I love the crossbow but these
guys are gonna take care of this with
the sledgehammer oh oh fuck my own fuck
ft oh my god you got it Luther out I the
only game in recent history that I have
straight-up regretted purchasing was
luftrausers for why that game is a same
log
how many tend to get ain't a
motherfucker with a sledgehammer
luftrausers is a really neat tech demo
if you want it if you want to spend a
really fun five minutes flying around
with luftrausers that's great the fact
that they charge you I don't know 15
dollars or even ten dollars is far too
much from luftrausers
the I have never regretted purchasing a
game more than ever granted purchasing
luftrausers it's it's really fun for
five minutes and then you will forget
about it forever all right so I'm seeing
a lot of FTL let's play an idea
