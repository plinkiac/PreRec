for one happy happy was it what
Wednesday
happy Wednesday motherfuckers fucking
minute early this despite that that
idiot and the Chad made me really want
to seriously delay the stream another
hour because because because principal
can you hear me or did I fuck up the
audio tremendously waiting for audio
confirmation well I don't think of
plates okay um
doom because I still haven't got doom
out of my system I don't know why but
it's there it's in me it's in my veins
all right yeah sorry I'll tabbed out to
set something else up here doom has a
none bindable tab key which I want on my
mouse because that takes me to the menu
because I've got a number of buttons on
my mouse but do moment you rebind tab so
I had to do some autohotkey work to get
that to work
oh they turn tutorials off actually did
I put this on ultra nightmare
I might have have an arm restart this
I forgot what difficulty I had to
actually game okay
it is that ultraviolence and materials
are off without mercy but you yeah it's
her solo string on Tom's down those are
Dulles fuck really I really need Jack to
help me carry a conversation hey my
brain isn't the reason for wired rockers
play games especially fast-paced action
games makes my choices doing you're
really dumb like I said it's in the
veins
game audio is a bit loud I'll fix that
we have to contain this
very huh the doorman
where's boobs will be ass this time out
here turn that way the fuck down and
then you let me know how that is when
the screaming here starts no no death
run that's that's always then the goal
that's always the goal I'm trying it on
tonight married I kicked it up a notch
I've done it successfully on normal hurt
me plenty that was that was in my comfy
home I don't know I don't know how is
gonna work here but we're gonna try
now it's too low I can't win I can't win
finally one from a t10 I'll fix it I'll
fix it how about a pacifist run I'm not
even sure that's possible or desirable
really
all right that is splitting the
difference
have I watched preacher yet I'm in no
rush to but that's one I think I'm
better off waiting but there's a ton of
episodes before giving it a chance
how long have I been plant was the very
very beginning of the game so I've been
playing for eight hours I think and I'm
gonna in the stream like a minute about
a minute
fuck
easy easy alright how's the UH how's the
audio now
what are safe demonic levels that's the
joke
I believe they intended that to be
humorous I would say 0% but this is a
base that deals with demonic energy so
probably just an issue they have to deal
with
adios good good
I'm willing to take full responsibility
for the harmful effects I'm taking zero
damage so far I think it's a good sign
let's read the boss okay me I put it on
once I like this
collect the things why not you know why
not things are they're collected that's
what you do let's try to hit these
fuckers in the background work sometimes
I think I hit me just didn't I
fuck I love that
you jerk already down to 50% health
that's just great
what's the opposite of doing great that
was bloody
got knocked around like a redheaded
stepchild something
yeah it's just mean like Jack could not
make it
like anything during the sale I need to
pick up a few little things Ingham nuts
am I missing or the half charges just
not legally
I don't know why I'm playing so cautious
so he's I'm a dumbass
then I'd die to the zombie losers in the
night no no I did get murdered by the
soldiers guy and their giant charged
blast was that like I had like 90 for
help and all the sudden I'm just dead
that's like what the fuck
b√∂ck
we did a face reveal all right I got
here's the deal I was gonna play doom
tonight
so in our streaming room I lugged up
folding table so I can make a makeshift
desk just be a little bit more
comfortable with the controls and
literally room for the camera I have a
folding table in a small room
if I accept that fucked up my mouse
sensitivity or one probably just flying
it away from my desk is weird so it
feels weird I don't know
but I think DLC for the sky should be
dune guy fighting Robo Hitler no I
wouldn't mind seeing a doom quake to
cross over demons versus strong that
would be fun
I tried class came home briefly it
doesn't make any damn difference to me
which side of the screen the gun is I
actually left might be weird but it's
fine orders
concentrate you killer
she just played unnormal but is what it
is witness
it's taking me multiple something was
too got kajigger but that's nothing
worse
better yet
what's this
are we just playing it in a weird
environmental
waste of that barrel
a lot of waste
if there was a doom guy should it be a
new movie should be called do guy or
Flynn Taggard doom guy I'd be too silly
Flynn Taggert I know that's what they
called them in the book but the book is
horrible I kind of like him being a
wolfenstein ancestor of bleach a bj
Blanca wits so I'm fine with BJ
oh you sneaky devil
well you are definitely some sneak is to
be expected
it's my favorite definition right there
twisting his ankle and shoving it to his
face wow that hurt
should be dead
now I'm gonna brick my no death run will
be a failure at this point
you call me a filthy casual if you want
but I usually play on hurt me plenty
yeah
hey throw go all the dudes normally the
first argent cell I use for mo totally
gonna be health totally gonna be health
this playthrough
right
I handed donations
what's today the sixth turtle Hawaiians
rich have you ever tried inca kola if
not i will have to send some to the peel
box be well LOL fuck my car
thank you i'll try that out if you send
I've never had it never had inca kola
turn otherwise else is going to see John
Carpenter this Saturday
he is playing music and talking think I
have watched almost all of his movies in
anticipation do you have a subversive
carpenter movie favorite big trouble a
little china far and away but you know I
like to laugh and I like adventure so
you know big trouble a little child is
really kind of perfect
do I have siblings multiple siblings
do I have any did it turn on I better
turn on these tips on here because I
know the laptop I'm reading stuff in the
laptop my secondary monitors kind of
bugging out on me and when that goes
into sleep mode I don't think I get the
updates on donations
another thing I've caught up
was the rock bad as doom guy yeah that
was Karl Urban I haven't I haven't seen
the damn movie anyway behind to Mars
after running diagnosed and what's the
fucking point it appears that I can
activate optional challenges it's not my
semi property what's happen to be
careful is the batteries are gonna die
in the stupid thing hello
battery's dying take a pause and all
alright so there are four people who
don't know the game at this point in the
game there are now challenges for every
level and these give you weapon upgrade
things in order to stay alive better I
would like the weapon upgrade things so
we got to fur kill two of the possessed
with one trigger pull from the shotgun
which I'm about to do in a second here
variety is the spice of death five
different glory kills on the possessed
that'll be easy enough to get and then
find three secrets and I know where they
all are here so that should be easy
won't pause nonnamous says did you see
the scoring trailer
aside from neat and we'll see how it
turns out and whatever other reasonable
boring things you usually say to
trailers what do you think I think I
have not even seen the scoring trailer
so I'm sure it'll be neat we'll see how
it turns out Nana says hi rich yo you've
mentioned a few times you enjoy space
Sims if you ever played Kerbal space
program personally I think it's one of
the best space Sims ever hi learning
curves that very rewarding I haven't I
haven't I have not played it much by the
way speaking of big little Big Trouble
in Little China and speaking of the doom
movie you know the rocks supposed to
play Jack burden in the new Big Trouble
in China reboot talks amongst yourselves
I feel like that
there's my troop twofer oh noes my demon
who's not dead he's dead now now we're
gonna start working on the glory kills
different deadly animations you get two
different animations based on what part
of their body you're you're pointing at
when you do the glory kill and what
position you are like if you're at their
side you go over their leg is different
if you're behind them and you go for
their legs right arm left arm head head
around legs and head twist
now you're gonna spawn huh maybe not
maybe none very late there's one of the
three secrets we need and I'll try and
find them all because you'd get two
weapon upgrades just by finding them all
stop remaking good movies that's how
they make money
remakes we're never gonna stop I'm now
convinced the human I'm playing on ultra
violence which from trying that design
that's me that's probably gonna be my
undoing here have I played I have not
but I I don't like shooters on consoles
I don't like aiming with the analog
sticks if I'm aiming in a game I usually
prefer it to be with a mouse then very
few exceptions of this rule only
vanquish that has been the only shooter
I've purely loved using a controller
why does my turning this is love is just
a game I play old doesn't make any sense
ah mr. funny
no big problem they're all dead
everything's add enough time for the
secrets here you climb these boxes run
across the thing and then I hate this
fucking ledge because it's above a
bottomless pit I really fucking hate it
I kind of get as close as I can then I
just jump up on the railing staring at
the corner typically make it up here up
here there is a swish back down make
sure we don't fall down the bottomless
pits and we have a secret
here we go have fun
pretty fucker
I was trading on blowing shit up
why am i turning so slow
the same fucking mouse I use at home oh
well deal with it
are you
Oh balls how did I not hit that barrel
how did that not happen
I think I need to get up here for any
secrets but there is some nice armor I
have no idea why this is encountered as
a secret door down there the other way
in this area is just open the door down
there but now I get up here I get this
chainsaw which I'm probably going to
need more on ultraviolence
everyone's dead
as they should be I don't know what
happened to original ideas in Hollywood
they thought out they could make more
money repackaging old ideas that were
popular star adventure 1 grosses 40
million dollars
Star Wars 8 roses 4 billion dollars
that's what happened
I swear to God does not be making
excuses for what I inevitably die but uh
my mouth feels like it's turning really
sluggish I don't know why I've got the
sensitivity turned a pretty high I don't
know if it's this mouse pad I'm using
this is work I'm just a
that's worse
94.1 hit
you fucking son of a bitch those imps
are great at their job which is constant
harassment constant
it's officially running low and figure
that shortly
something
not down look for a cord coming right
back
all right my laptop is plugged in I
shouldn't hit the button for the
elevator first but hey I'm a dumbass
see we've waited now I gotta wait again
I didn't really forget to pause
everything was dead get hurt when
everything's dead
maybe I missed something but I did not I
suppose this guy's still alive what do
you think do you think he's gonna jump
up now oh my god
that was the least effective jump scare
ever which i think is intentional I
think you're supposed to be anticipating
blowing his head off so kudos kudos to
the Deb's putting in a map too terribly
real jump scare so I can have the
satisfaction of blowing its head off
immediately it's like when you gain
control again during that you're your
cursor is actually pointed right at the
pig's head you just have to keep hitting
the trigger and you will blow his head
right off there is I'm gonna stand on
the rail here so I can jump back up I'm
gonna get it back up here because I'm
going to unlock a secret area this is
the door you might run past and not
think about when you don't have a key
card you can't open it but it's not the
area you need to go for the story and
going back to it's kind of out of the
way you get in here
you hit this button and then you open up
some crap
that opens up this little door Oh fucker
there's no way I'm gonna make it through
once it's just not gonna happen
I am NOT playing with a controller but I
have having I'm having some kind of damn
mouse issues here all right I don't know
what the problem is if it's the mouse
pad or something weird but I don't deal
with it I got a deal with it
you're hearing fart noises those are
probably subscribers what does this fish
understand sweetie romantic welcome to a
UEC smart since dimension locally into
the vast palace playing impact basin
this
it's the height of the desperate you're
racing myself well Peters let's see if
that helps
what's what's what well motherfucker
motherfucker fuck my life
fuck fuck my life
fucking slap them again
I would've died anyway what I say the
platforming is one strike against the
gameplay in this game platforming deaths
yes I never liked instant deaths and
pretty much any game
was not any game where you have held but
say instant death then it seems to be a
Mario game that's a little bit different
even then you get power-ups you can
survive hits I mean that's a straight-up
platformer falling deficits that's
expected there but Yohn a shooter there
shouldn't be instant pick that's that's
dumb
why do you keep missing this
that's part of not talking right now is
uh it's a fairly intense fight fairly
intense
please game to prize such a cheese
without a do better than they're not
playing it I don't I don't know I mean
obviously if you don't mind using a
controller it's not gonna kill you but
just a control scheme I don't like I
think I would rather not play it at all
I figure out the right mouse button a
little bit to soothe the matter nothing
I carry your dead now
if I ever played the doom mod that
replaced everything with Simpson sprites
no I didn't care for much of the sillier
that things like that like that was the
Barney mod there from you know fun is a
quick gag but I'd rather shoot demons
than an army of Homer Simpson's
I'm reading the chat right now
it's fun to watch me kick so much ass
and doom well I've been getting my ass
kicked today it's a gift which sucks if
you could withstand the power surge
grab it no I didn't see the thing saying
I can grab it stop up
now you talking about the Kix cereal do
you do know that there's an easter egg
in brutal doom where there is a brutal
kicks or chicks was a chick's was chicks
brutal chicks what do they call it
chicks pigs chicks doing Chex cereal
Chex quest brutal Chex quest we're in
the actual Chex quest you would shoot
the monsters and they would teleport
away but in the brutal doom Easter Egg
you know they they blow apart it's green
because it's brutal
I feel I should apologize for what's
happened here was the cause of all this
where you are kind of I can't even shoot
an emergency I can't even shoot his
hologram the regulator's have been
destroyed and the monitor or whatever
the fuck that is I can't
yeah yeah yeah continue
yes smashing every monologue panel
should be an option in the game I agree
I agree I'd listen to some of them by
choice though but at least at least doom
guys and Samuel Hayden some aren't
forced to slowly walk to the hardware
store which is a step up the facility
will not allow you access to the turbine
room unless the demonic threat level is
brought down inside the foundry
I'm just killing everything quickly
and collecting shit fuck it
yeah it's right here I'll grab it
kill all the things
this way
fucking
let me collect the hair before the
unappropriate probably don't have to
trigger the hologram
we'll see
let's see if it yells at me
oh yeah I can
start
it's d mommy could've ever better do
good even better
do I like what the chat has turned into
what has the chat turned into welcome
I'm mostly like playing the game did
something horrible happen did you all
mutate to monsters what can't we all
just be nice to each other what's what's
wrong
now you're just talking about cereal
No gentle and then whatever don't fine
we're not ignoring the chat but this is
not a game where you can really focus on
the chat I think I think trying would be
a mistake
these are for me to get that fucking
around fucking around trying to be
mastery for the machine gun and it's
costing me costing made my life
demonic threat reduced by fifty orders
and I'm not even gonna bother with that
elite soldier up there it's up fine say
how quickly we can go let's do a speed
this is a speed run now doing a speed
run you guys been watching any of SD uh
a little was it summer games done quick
sgdq
well Wow that got bad quickly start the
clock
start walking lock oh the the s gdq chat
is fucking worthless I don't know why
anybody even why would anybody even
bother going in these summer games done
quick chat there's a hundred and thirty
thousand people in their messages scroll
up before you even read them you say
anything it's just nothing the only
thing you can do in that chat is garbage
nice fucking awful
right in the fucking head
Damona Claire reduced by 75%
see what's going good
I'm the only one who misses down here
not that way
Crouse
well no wrong way wrong way wrong way
that's my fault my own damn fault
oh yeah Chad I'm not very fond of the
plasma gun in new doom plasma rifle
Kenneth it's worth it for the stun I use
the stun a lot but other than that no
much like it that's the path I should
have taken
yeah I could do better engaged you're
muting doom to listen to summer games
done quick you know what that's probably
the right call I'm not the most
entertaining person in the world
I'm not never claimed to be missing
we're down there and there did that one
oh it's open
I miss none of them
what what game would do were they
playing on SD sdgq sgdq classic are they
playing the new one
area
shots fucked up the wall behind them
pretty good
nope nope nope nope nope nope
Oh
everything up
like everything up
it's probably good I miss the fact
probably would have killed myself with
that Splash Damage but I didn't so it's
all good
the temperature is down statewide the
primary control role has been activated
somewhere nearby
it could be Olivia yeah I know yeah
right here
this game is warping your moral values
that's doomed it's a game more
evaluation it's relevant piece this is
all if it's fiction everything you know
is fictional characters plus they're
demons who cares if he's ripping demons
head off
she is trying to tell me to wreck
YouTube's are cancer comments do you
think best response is no response
I'm just feeding it
you could not and
someone who hates us is still watching
our streams well and still get those
views
the system won't allow anyone but Olivia
to override it now we will have to shut
down the archer town manually from the
surface well it'll be a better place we
just we didn't treat each other like
pricks yeah living longer then what's
wrong with that nothing I say nothing
you get a Renta comet just responded
with uh-huh it'll make them pretty mad I
didn't respond to one once with TLDR
they wrote a wall of text explaining why
Iron Man 3 was the worst thing to ever
happen to humanity and then me and Jack
were terrible people for liking it and I
just said TLDR turn it off 100 response
comics abling the tower induction
filters
I know something is wrong this is me
turning around I swear to God at home
this is like that that was like a 180
and now it off I'm off something is
going on and I'm blaming the surface I'm
playing on because that's the only thing
that's different
I forgot this janky-ass folding tables
for an old mouse pad whereas at home I
just used my smooth fake wood desk
particle board with some kind of
laminate
kind of fake wood paper on it
TLD arming means too long I've read hit
the button too long didn't read
yeah we'll stop
I love what they did with the Mandarin
that twist was fun I know it's probably
a disservice to the character in the
comics but look as someone who was in
the hugest Iron Man comic book fan that
was a great fit
and I don't know that it would have
worked if they just made up a name that
wasn't the Mandarin the missus ear or
something whatever
yes the kid was also great why do people
hate Iron Man 3 I don't understand why
people hate Iron Man 3 the delivery of
the twist was just lame I was smiling in
the theater Simon you know we agree to
disagree I suppose but I mean it worked
for me Tom said
fuck it
Oh
oh it's because I missed the rocket
launcher earlier in the secret
apparently that only does that only
spawn if you've missed the earlier
rocket launcher I've never seen that
there before I may have learned some new
doom thing weird and interesting oh god
this fight this fight is gonna kick my
fucking ass isn't it
Oh scratch my nose and it's not gonna
happen not gonna have an amends really
itches
like it really Oh God this is terrible
this is this is the worst this is just
the worst
all right scratch my nose scratch my
toes during the pork hill oh that was
good
oh don't appreciate the ability to
scratch your nose until you can't
right
yes
sorry I'm not talking about relatively
intense firefight
but the GDQ couch smelled man probably
let me know worse than the seat at a
movie theater I'm sure it's not the same
couch every damn year maybe it is
honey how many people have different
people how many times does somebody sat
on like your own personal couch I mean
over the course of the year or even I'm
gonna say I'm gonna say the gdq couch
smells average it probably isn't great
but I doubt the average couch smells
great
ah son of a bitch
we were only temporarily disabling the
tower you need to remove each lens
individually carefully release the
hinges the gdq college family has more
more sweating that before offering cheap
energy I'm gonna say knows the people on
the couch are usually just the
commentators they're not the ones
sweating it out maybe they don't lettin
people thinking it's the actual couch I
don't know but the couch is usually
their peanut gallery and they're
probably in a nice air-conditioned room
no I'm going to say you people probably
have their nice clothes on because
they're they're going out to a public
thing they're going to an event they're
not just you know hanging out and their
pajamas I'm gonna say that couch smells
relatively nice I depends on what they
do with the rest of the damn year but
especially if it's brand-new when gdq
stars
oh there was the thing that's starting
and I wasn't paying any attention to it
oh god oh god I've already fucked up
why are we talking about couch smells I
know what else you got
your couch has more dead skin cells
trapped in it than vetti wide scalp ah
just wait until she's dead then they'll
be plenty of dead skin cells she's not a
young woman you know just saying
so curiosity can I get crushed by this
thing
interesting all right all right well
that's fine yes Betty White is awesome
I'm not advocating for death I'm just
saying it's gonna happen and what it
does she's gonna have a lot of dead skin
cells trapped in her forehead but Betty
White is fuckin awesome
limited energy resource
I kind of done off the other way that's
you know what anyway anyways
fucked up
oh you prick unbelievable prick
there's the next thing take it yeah I
got those too I'm gonna go this way go
the wrong way kind of I'm just really
better
I'll go should have got some more
chainsaw fuel for this upcoming fight
but that's the brakes
Shido might be one in wine one of these
rooms and we've kind of started ignoring
secrets bud
ain't no upgrade speedrun I thought
about doing it not really a lot of a lot
of speedrunning it seems if you do
things that aren't fun like you know
break into the game going through walls
it's fun to watch it's just not a way I
really want to play a game like shooting
the things
accuracy
amazed at myself
fucker
I'm being dumb being really dumb
most games come out if you see anyway
yeah lately they have been like this has
been the PC generation
the hell was our how was her last
Phoenix right stream I got cheated out
of that death animation and that's sad
did not want to fuck around in the
summit
that's another step
nice death Hey
we spent decades perfecting the science
selling it to humanity we balance their
Hill energy with our science making it
usable and safe we solved an energy
crisis the world had no answer for it
works you cannot do this um was I get to
house I can do something oh yes I think
I remember what it was
getting ready to beat the shit out of
everything to this next section
one small ball says I recently watched
the doom movie the worst part is the
disappointing use of The BFG it shot
three times and never hits any monsters
or people just walls
why the fuck would they do that oh my
god I haven't I haven't watched the damn
doom movie and more and more I hear
about it the more and more justified I
feel in my stance
fresh meat fresh fucking meat
turn all the shreds it's an I'm gonna
fucking do
yeah
all right the Berserker fucking powerup
is the best thing in this fucking game
it's fucking great
if stopping our energy production is
what you need contract one wasn't that
woman so much grandmother's cultured
energy will no longer exist in this
solar system we will be Bacchus where
one
a mod sheath run where you only use the
desert powerup would be fun yes it would
it would I kind of want to see it now
Evan you'd be completely overpowered but
the same time who gives a fuck power is
like Mike Tyson on a date where I've
been giving this a try oh how wow that's
it then there's nothing else to be done
oh yeah okay click on the thing click on
the thing this head to the next mission
everyone was just infected humans that
is the dumbest fucking thing it's not
it's not doom without the demons I think
it's one of the necessary ingredients I
have not seen Eraserhead
Jack trigger choice
Oh primary access points to the tower
were destroyed in the explosion demons
are the one essential element um its
space do you need bars do you need
demons isolated away from earth I think
it's part of it oh I can grab either of
the the weapon mods in the last level
yeah big fucking deal big fucking deal
it's trying to I was trying to get the
weapon mastery for the assault rifle I
knew I was getting beat up but I thought
it might be worth it just to get the the
upgrade you need you need demons and I
think at a location slowly going to hell
okay what if you doing the Old West the
Old West slowly going hell is that doom
if you set it in the Wild West
is that still doom
ah assuming I lose the weapon mastery no
but that would be fucking rad about that
doom in the West I assume you're talking
about doom of the West Oh
checking on me oh I still have the
mystery oh that's good best ship
what is the most challenging video game
ever in my opinion
ah
can you can you rule out any game with
infinite continues is that fair here's
here's my gut reaction to that my the
one the game first game that comes to
mind
Chad you might be able to bring up
something that will change my mind
but I'm gonna say ghosts and goblins I'm
mostly familiar with the arcade version
I think the next one is just as
difficult a ninja ninja gaiden this is
Chet not not as hard as fucking ghosts
and goblins man Battletoads is that
mostly that one infamous level in
Battletoads the the bike level whatever
whatever the fuck they were riding oh I
just used it did something stupid
everything's fine
and here's the thing when we're talking
about difficult like is Battletoads
difficult or as Battletoads
poorly-designed what's the difference as
ghosts and goblins a good game they're
just hard I liked it well enough how
high ghosts and goblins is a game
also for for good hard well not
necessarily good harborage is hard look
up some Mario maker levels the there's a
style of level making I think they call
it
Kai's o ka ICO and they're insanely hard
Mario levels made Mario maker I think
the first one was a rom hack and maybe I
think guy made it was kind of was his
name I think maybe that's why it's
called Kaiser but either way they
require some kind of just insane yet
creative twig sure that tricks to beat
and it's some fun stuff to watch on
YouTube
sorry chances do you think you two would
finish the first Phoenix right would you
be interested to eventually case 4 is
great every little of your voices and
both of you bouncing thoughts / ideas
off each other
I'm I'm fine with it but think as those
I'm a you know it's been fun how Jack
feels - I don't know I don't know how he
feels about it I'd be up for it if it
doesn't want to maybe I can talk him
into it
super meatboy 100% is nearly impossible
watch some speedruns of Super Meat Boy
but Jane I did with sgdq thing going on
it look at some speedruns type stuff it
can be interesting to watch and I don't
think I can ever do it but there's
people who make meat boy look easy
I thought I'll talk to Jack about
Phoenix right I mean a lot of times we
play what we're doing next but here it's
not next week we're doing this game in
that game and usually what are you in
the mood for today yeah how about this
2048 I should stream 2048 maybe the
terrible stream but I'm very fond of
that game it's the new Tetris in my eyes
why would you have an invisible coin
block where someone would naturally jump
that's just cheap and frustrating yes
yes not all the kaizo levels do that
though I think just the original ones
mostly did it's not like I'm a fucking
expert that I don't think I could even
beat one of those myself what the fuck
is wrong with the mic now you tell me
what sorry the mic best sound what's
going on something disconnected I don't
know you guys should play some obscure
games no one knows about whenever we do
that people bitch
your audio is fine all right good
no the wrong one that that blue fucking
fucking targets the fucking drone next
to her fucking fucking bullshit so such
a thing as a good bad game we've had
this discussion before I'm less I'm less
convinced it's a thing might be a couple
ones out there
what is it
dum-dum-dum followed by dump
I deserve to die I deserve that we're
going in close to the fucking rocket
launcher my fan of the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre movies not really I'm not much
of a horror guy that's Jace thing
that's what I should've done
all right think everything's dead my
opinion Eraserhead I've never seen it
sort of ritenour that's interesting
I remain uncertain about the preacher TV
show
rich listen you want to grow food when
you're younger any crazy dream job
lottery winner
someone from Chicago well Chicago area
deep-dish overrated
is there any differentiation to like a
New York Pizza and just like a regular
old pizza slice that you you get at most
pizza places
if they'd just taken like a thin slice
of pizza and they called it New York
just for some reason
New York tends to be full of itself I
say that knowing we having fans from the
yard go fuck yourselves
now you're great
really I have a New York story wait let
me let me finish this battle and I'll
call the New York story
what's what's that the New York hotdog
what are they what are they called
they're called Nathan's I used to work
at a grocery store way back when and one
day I was I was like stocking like lunch
meat and there was this lady shopping
there and she's looking at the hot dogs
and I walked up to her and I have I have
a strong opinion on hot dogs I said Deb
you know II had a beef hot dogs they're
they're the best advice you should
usually get the Vienna beef and she
looked some in she says oh I'm from New
York we only eat nathan's hot dogs
I wanted to I wanted to hit her getting
getting this arrogant hot dog attitude
about Nathan's Hot Dogs
which I've had nathan's they're
overrated as fuck not that fucks
overrated it's just the thing to say
oh it's rich solo stream yeah sorry to
disappoint you
sorry to disappoint you motherfucker
what do you want what do you want out of
my butt out of Meehan
Hebrew National I had those they're not
bad
too late oh I'm too late and I'm dead no
I'm not dead
alright that's good but suck still
falling down
am I going to replay XCOM 2 now all now
that all of the LCS ones eventually
I'll get around to it like 8,000 games I
need to get around dude so what happened
what happens
where is everybody many things to shoot
last what is so underpowered in this
game if it weren't for the stun this
thing to be fucking useless
easy-easy what it's worth I think I'm
getting my ultra-micro bearings
fuck it you're gonna get a hot dog I
haven't had a hot dog at a very long
time I don't remember when the last time
I had a hot dog was I like Culver's yeah
they're good
this is placed in here called georgie
porgie s-- which have become pretty fond
of the burger place
do I think we could swap our Sunday
stream to Saturday I don't know I don't
know how that would work for Jack I
don't know there's any good reason to do
it
space cop hotdogs yeah this cheap
fucking Oscar Mayer shit dogs those
don't count made for a movie scene I
didn't enjoy because they were fucking
awful Oscar Mayer hot dogs
spit bucket rich uh yeah we've used one
when we've needed it I don't think there
was ever a scene in space cop where I
was eating a hotdog that we had to do
enough takes of where I needed one not
eating a hotdog in that much in the
movie pay attention next time Matt no
that's not insult I just mean it's an
interesting fact go through I'm really
not eating that many hot dogs in space
car
social eating on Twitch I don't
understand that that's so weird
I don't understand the world I live in
anymore shredding dangerously close to
fetish territory says the Vox humanists
it's more than just clothes that's flat
out in fetish territory I can't imagine
any other reason to watch someone eat on
Twitch
oh good die we're gonna die
bust my health oh shit happens fucking
deal with it you know
well international she's opening the
gates of hell the key to the future
which was just damage of horrible glory
it's expanding not too long ago they
started twitch created which is I think
was intended to be like like art kind of
stuff ever ever see that girl I think
she's on twitch she does like the the
makeup to make her look like a comic
book character like like straight out of
a comic not just the approximation of
her costume like ink lines and
everything she makes herself look
cel-shaded
Oh
oh stop wasting ammo
this dude doing brutal doom on summer
games done quick as he saves is armed
Miller yeah everyone who's ons on sgdq
they're insane what they do it's why
they're asked to be on sgdq Bhim I guess
that's some Dark Souls 3 again please
question mark question mark question
mark says committee in 120 last time I
played it I was having technical issues
on the PC so I haven't played that much
of it Jack's the one with the the blah
opinion on it but that's that's Jack I
haven't played it too much I like what I
played
alright let's switch it up um I've done
a lot of doing here on switch it up
see if I missed any tips here no I have
not
that is all tipping is normal oh that
one I just got it was called I had to
anyone find remember it might be
terrible how's that not even it's done
how big is that now 47 estimated
download time I'll fuck that fuck that
right in the nuts
why don't we god I don't have an itch
for rocket League but it's a solo stream
and I know how quiet I get during rocket
League so I should probably avoid it
I dream necrodancer recently oh my god
what have I got
racketeer and that the mood right now
not in the mood right now I don't want
to play something for the first time
what if I got everyone heads down well
bit me and Jack
oh my god I know Cam's okay we'll go
over with you like a wet turd halfway
the game is called halfway I've played
FTL so many times is that really is does
everybody really want to watch me play
FTL I'll do it I'll do it but I mean
we've done so much of it I played a
little Dishonored I'm not gonna stream
it that's what I'm gonna play my own all
right
I'm not saying a groundswell of support
for FDL not seeing it finish the last of
us never fucking never
oh my god I got one of my god
I do recommend I just shut up when I
played
I I forgive you for the Last of Us joke
you're allowed to like it I don't care
about that and just it's not it's not my
thing
I don't know what I'm in the mood for
I could play one of the FBI I could play
one of the FES as people have been
recommending but I'm been doing a lot of
that lately I'm gonna go with the
Melissa shit hurry on
yeah after why it would just be a bad
stream game
sort of like a download history or
something got downloaded recently I
don't think would be too bad
but my list is clear for some reason
that's alright whatever
I could play rocket League with everyone
in the chat but then I just shut up and
then everyone's watching me go hey oh
nice shot though and that's that's blah
I really need someone with me sitting
next to me when I play rocket League or
it doesn't work it just doesn't work
so I'm looking what people have bought
parently I'm not the only one who saw
defunct on sgdq and thought it looked
neat now that I've not that I've played
it yet but I I think it's interesting
that a number of uh my Steam friends
have bought that right around the same
time I did I thought I bought some kind
of 2d platformer rissalah that it look
fun but I'm not not seeing it my history
here if I get you just go with
you know that
and then to update the stram the Strome
the Strome
they're all right and played this in a
while
that's weird are you trying to play in
the other monitor for some reason oh
fuck me
all right let me know if this is
streaming I just had an issue with it
using the wrong mind you of the monitor
cool all right streaming good thank you
thank you
this is enter the gungeon the name
should pop up shortly anyway
I'm not even close to beating this game
now that I've played it much kind of a
kind of office
sweet busan
all right I guess I'm starting to
scratch nothing that's a big deal
heed my words and I shall show you how
to survive this thing christened
labyrinth continued to the dull to begin
yet to finish on what to greatness try
flipping these tables are kicking those
barrels with the a button you can use
those as cover yes if angry
excellent interacting people proceed to
the next room this is the most important
lesson you can dodge row by pressing lb
and a direction you are invulnerable to
gunfire during the first half of the
dodge roll but vulnerable again when you
hit the ground this means you can dodge
through bullets and other hazards
requires precise timing and you give the
word I'll open the barrier use the dodge
roll to reach the right side of the room
without perishing wait until the last
second then press lb to begin the roll
are you ready to begin to test
yeah we're not ready
nice work an impasse use your dodge role
to jump over that pits the doors open
but you've got one last print across
time it well go on through the door the
dodge roll is the first and best way to
avoid dying in a gunfight sometimes
though the number of bullets can be
overwhelming for instance there's no
dodging through that but there is a way
to clear the path these are called
blanks using one would lead all enemy
projectiles in a room and stop enemies
from shooting for a short period they
will also push nearby enemies away great
if you need a second to reposition pick
them up by walking over to the moon
using blanks by clicking the LS and RS
at the same time use blank to clear the
way of bullets and then quickly make it
through the cap excellent thanks refill
every flaw so use them when you need to
they can also be found throughout the
gungeon but I wouldn't rely on not
onward onward to victory
you've got the basic stuff guy I suppose
you've earned a reward a gun befitting
your stature and experience go on open
it
peace your baby's first gun but first
you'll need something to shoot what are
the gungeon natural inhabitants cruel
savage and bloodthirsty now kill him
cold-blooded truly you are ruthless next
rooms will be real gunfights kill all
the enemies in each room and the doors
will open
I'll meet you a few rooms ahead now go
you've made it you know how to dodge
roll shoot and use blanks for there's
more to learn you need to know how to
use items that don't exist in gun form
this med kit for example it will
replenish your health pick it up by
approaching and hitting the a button
you've got plenty of health right now so
don't use it yet but when you think you
need it
gem the odd tee button to use it okay
head on through I want Archie to shoot
why is that not the way it works this is
just weird
all right you seen that thing on the
other side that's a teleporter whenever
you find one you can always return there
as long as you aren't in combat to use
it first open the map by holding left
trigger then select the blah blah blah
blah symbol the revolver bullet chamber
symbol you wish to warp to and press a
to travel there got it
should I explain it again got it good I
use the teleporter to cross the gap
remember you can walk to any teleporter
on the map not just ones in the same
room but they won't work if you are in
combat you press a while standing on
that portal you can use it to teleport
back to where you were and we're waiting
a few rooms north of here you should
explore trying to find a better gun
before you challenge the boss boss boss
doesn't do do misshapen
I learn to move and eat sometime
they're not good
so they asked Ben to Oliver
oh not why
I made that blank button
speak with me when you are ready for
your final challenge are you ready to
put all you have learned in the test
then face me in single combat begin
cease fire cease fire wait
that shield you found my shield which
means you know my terrible secret it's
true I never conquer the gungeon I'm no
longer sure this even he's the gungeon
how humiliating it's all that bastard's
fault
let's make block now they were supposed
to be partners but shortly after we
arrived I was shot in the back when I
awoke I was trapped in some kind of
chest I called out for help but no one
came I'm sure it was him who shot me
thinking what of the gun for himself but
he must not have made it
because if Blackman had changed the past
he would never have come to the gunship
and either would I but I'm still here
so we must have left and maybe he's
stuck in the guns you too it would serve
the master right you found him tell them
many says hi you know what I mean
hey now nobody said anything about
killing you but yes please do anyway I
have nothing left to teach you
good luck with the gungeon and your past
right what I did the thing Oh
jerks
apparently I'm not very talkative I play
this which is fine I guess
fuckers
I lost four nice helmet
I would probably enjoy this game a lot
more without reloading
it's dead end here
not bad not bad
that norm I didn't suck completely
that's what's going on chef
my indie conspiracy theories I think
they're fun but I don't typically
believe them I'm not sure what I've ever
believed one
look at that she's just one of the
cheese it's all I wanted shop
crossbow remember not liking the
crossbow
should I have 57
let's go to the green that might be more
interesting acquired two keys to get to
then I didn't waste the first key look
what I get when I get B hi beehive
so the mo nomicon is able to tell us
behind this nature's gun give it a good
shake and let the bullets fly I'll set a
weapon oh there's a weapon
interesting this could be fun
now here
get lingo
all their homing
that shit that was shit
Oh
oh good good
good
murrs shotgun okay he's got a fish tail
on the back
all right I could do that
which to a gun with infinite ammo well I
think I do
never lost for the idiot rock dodge hole
wrong button if that was effective
nope
good game but I suck so hard oh god oh
god I hate them
fuck my nutsack
fuck my nutsack
Oh Windows 10 door automatic restart
bullshit but it was the laptop one of
them restarted so
I know I might lose that when you have
leave and come back or something rear
and shoot
no this is starting work since I haven't
do I want to switch to my B's kind of
entire sketch here
or do I want to save all over the
shotgun for a bit
I don't know if I need any of those
things yet
oh fuck
I'm terrible at this game Wow Wow
see what what regular button am I not
using here cuz that is not working for
me that is constantly redoing ah shit
here what am I not using what I'm gonna
not not well no no that's not the one
oh great what did I have us a right
button shit
yeah sure why not sure went on its way
got it now
nope
alright I'm gonna use this shotgun when
I'll die because I'm going to be
ridiculously low on health
oh all right oh that's right I had the
thing where I can come for you no and I
forgot about it
he starts with that it's been a while
since I've played this game characters
got this character starts with a helmet
and radio that I believe can call for an
old and I'm so busy dodging things but
I'm doing a terrible job of explaining
what's going on in this game and I feel
bad about that I feel a JIT bad about
that boss or Explorer
the boss I think I can explore later Oh
the Gorgon
dammit
all right good I'm not locked out from
going the way I came let's let's go on
to explore some more I'm sorry I'm so
quiet I didn't realize how quiet I would
be playing this game me no talk good

entertain yourselves you're adults we've
been we've been through this before this
rich heavens solo stream crisis crisis
and infinite silence
I hate those fucking meet you guys
go back and get the gun what gun did I
miss
we're done that I miss where do I stand
on urinating outside do it if you have
to
if you go to a gas station like like ten
minutes before they close and the
bathrooms locked and yesterday and they
tell you somebody's in there but then
you buy an item and and wait around
because you have to use the bathroom and
then when once the ten minutes is up and
he says oh you got to go
I say well have to wait and use the
bathroom and it turns out there's nobody
in there he just cleaned the bathroom
and he didn't want anyone else to make a
dirty and then he's gonna kick you out
then it's okay to go outside and pee on
their gas station I'm not saying this
from experience
oh wait I went back as people said yeah
I'm not good at holding on are
probably would've been better off

pronounced
I can't even say pronounce right so how
am I gonna say
Lorain Z and that's what I'm sticking
with and they say is the next God of War
a female fantasy game no the next kind
of war is a naughty dog game where you
spend most of the time having dialogues
and interactions and very little time
actually fighting monsters and when you
do this is gonna be a fairly scripted
sequence where there's only really one
way to go about the battle and say be
kind of boring cuz ninety dog games are
popular deal with it deal with it I
don't like Naughty Dog I know
chat freaks out whenever I say a
negative thing about a dull ass naughty
dog game but he's just fucking deal with
it alright everybody thank you for
showing up to the chat I appreciate it
and next time we'll make sure jack is
here so that someone is actually talking
possibly possibly me too with somebody
to poke me with a stick
