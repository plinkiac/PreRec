[Part I]
dick the birthday boy I
drinking tonight I'm drinking cold
refreshing water it's lovely
so I'm not drinking tonight so you don't
have to drink like your hero me I
usually only drink on the weekends
how long do I think tonight you know
we're gonna we're gonna see how long we
go I'm gonna go I'm gonna say at least
until 11:00 so at least what two and a
half hours and hopefully it'll go later
because it's been a while since I've had
a good gaming session I've been getting
a lot of work done on the next
previously recorded and some other
projects I've been working on that I
can't talk about and then I've been
reading a lot more which I've been
loving let's see here water I know
than usual no I did get what item did I
just get I just logged in a little bit
ago and I just got what did I just got
these and I have no idea what these are
perfect I just got the professor specs
where I got them or how I got them
but I got him I have no idea how so
maybe maybe we'll put them on is that a
medic only item how can we tell I just
cleared out a whole buncha
I put that on anyone I mean my medics
got a word ooh maybe we'll take off my
blighted mask put on the professor specs
no this is way better this is way better
yeah oh I know I have a lot of crates I
have a ton of crates and I hate them all
and I'm gonna I'm gonna trash most of
them to I and I hate them so much but uh
I'll give you four bucks for those fixed
Who's the real Plinkett Rich or Mike
manly chicken asks I I personally think
I mean you know what's cannon right
cannon is that there are two Plinkett's
that exists possibly in the same
universe because Palpatine came to visit
Rich Plinkett it depends on who you ask
I I think you know the first Plinkett I
knew about was was a movie review
Plinkett that was the only Plinkett I had
ever known about so
you
so he's my Plinkett
but you know it's it's different for
everyone
let's see here you can get steam money
what
put them in the steam mark no no you
know what I tried selling a whole bunch
of crates on the steam market you know
for a penny here and a penny there and I
just they never left they never left so
I was like F fuck it
stop showing the sausage-making is there
sausage making happening sorry
except Rich-Plinkett was in
The Revenge of Nadine 
you're right you're right hmm
but maybe that was all a dream
think about that we don't know there's a
lot we don't know about Plinkett
now I don't know they're both Mr.
Plinkett they're different they're
slightly different Mr. Plinkett maybe oh
and you know what maybe they're the same
Mr. Plinkett but on
various ends of the timeline so maybe
Rich's Mr. Plinkett is like the
present-day Mr. Plinkett and all of the
Plinkett reviews are Mr. Plinkett from
the future way about that after Mr.
Plinkett gets a little older and a
little angrier because it's been taking
so long to fix his VCR huh did I just
blow your mind
I probably did
steal four five six said you should
probably dub over rich with Mike's voice
and I want to say that that was a
thought when they when they started half
in the bag and even during that first
Revenge of Nadine stuff there was an
early thought of dubbing over everything
Rich said and I think they realized
rather quickly that it would be an
incredible pain in the ass to to do that
to get it to match up to get it to sound
right to get to look right and so they
they made that decision very early on
just to go with Rich's voice and
especially for half in the bag I
incredibly agree with that decision I'm
gonna start playing now
a crisis on infinite pointed CS
would I leave my wife for future ji mean
only if he promised never to dye his
hair because the the little streaks of
gray were something incredibly manly and
but you know a lot of guys they get
older and then they get self-conscious
so you know if he started dyeing his
hair deal-breaker as far as I'm
concerned absolute deal breaker
oh my god
all right we're gonna help in this we're
gonna happen this what do we need we
need an engineer of course we need an
engineer Sal for going up whoa I gotta
change my oh come on I got a quick
change my my settings I'm playing with
my controller as I always do
boom oh and my my sensitivity settings
are a lot of whack Thank You O Matic but
we gotta get we got to get some stuff up
first get some stuff up how about the
team how about the team
get out of here get out of here how
about the team before I changed my
sensitivity yeah
sniper got him sniper came at me boo
that put in
yeah
I had my controller yes I played a lot
of food I do play a lot of tf2 and I do
play with the controller as we've
discussed many times but my controller
right now is all Janka fide which is
incredibly upsetting
boom good at I have my controller set up
in a very specific way which includes my
jump button being left trigger and would
add yeah
get out of here get out of here can't do
nothing about that
uber I can kill this man nope oh are you
come oh well whatever muscle memory is
real oh you guys muscle memory is
incredibly incredibly real naval game
ped okay so first thing we need to do is
bump up the sensitivity that is
incredible number one so then jump is
left trigger that's really really
important as far as I'm concerned
and then I'll for medic what I'll format
it is the X button oh here we go
detonate stickies and all that is
instinct - there we go
okay
apply okay get out of here
all right
oh my God look at all the dams okay we
are not doing very well here guys
what do we need we need a medic great
we need people not
we need people not farting around
- fuck stop partner
I don't have time to build up an uber we
are very much gonna lose it's okay come
on get out there get out there go
now we are very much gonna lose
there's not a previously recorded steam
group there is a there is a red letter
media steam group
there's a red letter media message board
steam group that you can join I forget
what it is
that's not what I want I want I want
that to be taunt and medic to be a
that's what I want okay let's go you

disconnect from this one let's work on
our work on our options okay

his edit key call for medic is going to
be is going to be a button and taunts
here we go taunt he's going to be X
button that's
attack your weapon
apply okay let's try this again let's
get in on it
okay what's going on in this room now
to his steering wheel on foot pedal I I
play with the controller there's nothing
I can do about that i I have tried many
many times to play with the mouse and
keyboard and every single time failed
that there's even one time I tried they
have um they have like a mouse and
joystick option and I forget what the
product is called I did not I did not
much care for it I will tell you that
time to get in there okay that's not
going anywhere we got some we got some
very real lag happening
got it
jams guys my Jam's oh that was a spy

spy if when it's you there it was
where's the century I heard a century
okay all right I'll get him I'll get him
I got medic back up
oh okay all right that's you know what
that's fine that's fine life is
suffering yeah like I said guys I just
this is me just warming up and I'm still
not quite or I want to be this I'm just
warming up in I wall I will hop on an
empty server and you can all come and
play and it'll be super SuperDuper fun
has anyone notice any anything weird
with my audio sync I don't feel quite a
hundred percent
there's going to be a spy coming out of
that door anytime now
there is see I'm not paying attention
guys go for Austria
how do something great yeah I just want
to make sure like what's happening on
screen is what I'm talking about the I'm
actually streaming from the computer I'm
using and normally yes normally I run
that the signal to a different computer
for streaming just for kind of like
these that use like a load of my
computer but
get out of here if in fact it's up there
now he's dead he's dead everybody's dead
it's okay
I'm fine how are you boom that's always
nice
I was a way out
okay yeah there is my options we need my
sensitivity little bit higher not quite
where I want okay hey I'm on bloonan oh
come on
Oh auto swap while we're all up here now
now that I'm on this team I don't know
anything that's happening jack is going
on game by Jack uh all these plays are
the gamepad this is just what I'm used
to
I'm used to playing with a gamepad so
that's what I'm gonna do player one no
he'll everyone don't just yell me I
don't know man
oh no stop what's the video what's
happening ace
who's doing what now daddy
Oh see this sweet jeebus Christ
just warm up I should have been warming
up earlier today but I was working
instead getting my thumbs prepared
Oh sniper I do need to hunker down I do
have a drawing tablet actually that was
something I've tried I have a have a
Wakeham or walking or whatever you call
it I do have one of those tablets for
graphic design and After Effects work
and all that Jam
and that was a thing that I tried
thinking that it might
thinking that it might be easier for me
to use that
and it never did have you never worked
on I tried that I tried mouse keyboard
nothing ever worked
except for game pad and that's my story
that's my story about why I don't use a
mouse and keyboard and yes I know a
mouse is more accurate and more
sensitive and you can move faster but if
it doesn't feel right what point is
there moving faster
all right we did it we're doing pretty
good
hey no high fives all around
only one pocket medic at a time though
that's the rule guys only one pocket
medic at a time let's get out of here
let's go this way
let's see if we can blow up all these
guys by the doors
oh my oh my guard did I lose my medic
whoa whoa whoa whoa hey guys let's take
a moment to settle down okay
let's just like as that let's just be
calm
God God mother fucking damn it let's
just be calm for it one hot steaming
second
should we
you know I like they're all in place
goddamn cookies
and there's a spy engineer thing or a
nice soft
hey try my heart wait oh geez that's the
other thing that I want on this is the
other side that needs to be dealt with
is chat use voice communication this is
the one my button okay yeah I know I
know yes okay let's go
excellent ready to charge
didn't he didn't deploy that's fine J
but have you guys taken over the server
I distrust that medic
son of a bitch what a jerk I know oh
yeah I don't think you guys thought I
had we have next one oh good
how's it excellent play I feel really
good about that I feel I feel very good
about that what just happened
killing a couple people didn't help very
much but it helps enough where I'm gonna

gonna try it again trying to get up here
and do it
are you guys getting here so fast a
teleporter know how you died okay great
J Bowman no I shake my fist at you you

my AK that's exactly how you hack into
my account is by going through Microsoft
Office back up back up
it's not the high road behind us okay I
got him
let's see what I can do now let's see
what kind of damage we can do your hands
let's go around that right yep yep
Thanks I'm allative get more cop
by behind us on the car
back up back up back up magnetic any
field
Danya sorry if I'm not talking I was
concentrating Google Voice up five four
sixty that's exactly how you do it just
Google Google where's harlech where he's
hard like playing tf2 and you will
you'll get reroute it to some really
great hacking instructions I should have
taken the job
I find that fight by up top
guys
did I receive any resumes no I have now
I see I don't believe we've received any
resumes yet I have not been into the
studio in some time so I do not know I
did warn them about the possibilities of
all the resumes
and they were very excited about that
Davies fuss a cool day doesn't look good
doesn't look like we're gonna make it
overtime
get there get there
not gonna do it that's alright however
the hips and a lot of resumes
back you need to do some commentary I
know I'm trying to do commentary while
I'm playing the game but I get very
wrapped up in the game so I'm gonna
officially work on that that's gonna be
my top priority
top men are on it top men are on it
let's um let's find do another mic
impression um I don't I don't know if I
can do another my compression my guys
playing their some video games that's
cool yeah I think we could play sand dr.
Mario
that's my mic impression he talks very
low and slow and a lot of Plinkett is him
under fine Oh Thunder Mountain yay
I wanted to play Thunder Mountain this
is exciting like I want to play spy but
you guys will see where I'm gonna be
spying so I'll you know what I'll
engineer because I love engineer so
nobody do not do not mid me because I'm
gonna be engineer
that's the rule
you can have all the pizza rolls you won
get them at the store Brittany got here
here yeah I know like but still what if
I what if I'm going for like a long
maybe I'll try a spy thing later we'll
see probably don't need three engineers
but we you know the all the new taunts
are really what's the word I'm looking
for superfluous like they're really
unnecessary but I do enjoy them back to
Mario
it is a Mr. Plinkett impression but if
you take away the Jersey and if you take
away some of the blubber that's Mike
that's like you know like most replying
or House alarm or exact to rush on
that's a terrible Mr. Plinkett impression
I'm really apologize but mine kiss
mother is not on you know this is what
we're gonna do Mikey you know like Star
Trek generations review is more like you
know funky Christmas pastime
here we go there we go getting started
getting in there
getting in there clearing out this damn
area
where where as spies I can sense you oh
nice shot nice shot
Akeem the dribbles of a jersey but - but
- Jersey - blogger equals might yes that
is exactly correct
Sam is dead
by the cart okay I got a who's dead
good good gotcha hmm the lies so we can
join your plays oh why not online oh
sorry guys I will I will after after I'm
done with this game I will I will appear
online so y'all know I should have built
a dispenser
sorry team
whoa whoa whoa
Jesus Jesus everything is terrible
now is me itching my shoulder my head
the one guy that that's true this guy's
in heaven one what's happening there we
go okay now we're gonna now we go to
teleporter coming up got a soldier
coming back
well you guys all see where I'm building
up over my shoes man
what there's a pen defend the building
mix in the car
just shout for did you SAP you mom fuck
get up there get up there get in there
get up there doesn't have it
guys and having good where'd you go spy
I see
let's read out
some books beeswax
get out of here I was not thinking I was
not thinking but you can't just run you
can run or right underneath that sentry
getting flustered that's all right
griefing tf2 videos are always hilarious
I do think so I okay
I definitely feel bad for anyone who's
getting grief at the time obviously but
they are very funny
how about we get to build a dispenser
to camera and audio what so I assume
rich isn't here what does Jack do behind
the scenes nothing I mean five Jim do
you mean just behind the scenes at red
letter media yeah sometimes I'll have a
camera or just help out on shoes or act
if they need someone like an extra or
something I will do that I just help out
where needed the general rule of thumb
is anytime that you see Mike and Jay on
camera and the camera moves that's
usually me but not all the time and then
you know obviously I'm on best to the
worst and and now we do previously
recorded and that's about it you know I
just I just help out where needed and
most of the time that's just you know if
they're building a set I will just help
them build the set I don't know if any
of you saw the great me holding up the
wall video that's exactly the kind of
stuff I do yes mr. Brian well thank you
I exactly I hold up walls oh sorry sorry
DJ sorry DJ I didn't see her anyway
you know it's just there like or if
we're shooting like an external location
I'll just come and carry stuff so they
don't need to worry about that
Jesus Christ Wow I guess we're gonna
conk it out turn
I like the conga I think it's dumb
New York Ripper maybe we should do a
best of the best show where we just talk
about good movies
I actually do think that is a good idea
and it would be very down for that idea
it's a little tough because there's less
comedy in good movies you know and we do
try to be entertaining you know we try
to make jokes and it's just
there's lots of jokes to be made
somewhere with a good movie just because
it's like oh yes they handle that shot
correctly you know not much there
well we walk and there's a teleporter
I'm telling you guys
oh no just a guy all right that's fine
citizen came Casablanca dark man
absolutely Zell I don't I don't care for
Citizen Kane I think it's rather boring
obviously I understand rollerblading
movies made
fuck fuck fuck get away understand the
significance of Citizen Kane but I still
think it's really boring so I don't know
that was actually that was a thought of
a series of - taking movies that were
supposedly classics and perhaps you know
finding a way to rip them apart nice bye
let's push that cart doing good doing
good doing good
Solman OJ Bowman
son of a bitch
son-of-a-bitch spies
I got spies everywhere
you know what I got I got spies
everywhere
shit shit shit shit guys if you see a
pyro it's a spy you don't have any
Pyro's
boss
shotgun best weapon ever in any game

my favorite thing about these little
centuries is how they distract people
they distract people so you just turn
around and shoot hey hey we did it
terrific down terrific terrific job
everyone dynasty warriors the movie
directed by Michael Bay would be awesome
nothing but blood and explosions
conga conga conga shaped bobbin you guys

conjuring by jumping of that dunkirk on
your like it's dumb chunking is dumb
that doesn't mean I won't like it
down whoa whoa pro assassin let's settle
down
let's just take a moment and set o VF
down I don't believe I have played the
original command & Conquer or Red Alert
what were those on those sound like PC
games and for a very long time I did not
have a very capable PC so a lot of the
earlier a lot of the earlier PC games I
did not get my hands on because I never
had that capable of a PC
where's that card
let's get on that cart let's do this
oh no you don't
oh yes you do oh yes you do you're gonna
it's just a great little example on a
segment we're gonna call Jack's not
paying attention I can hear the Sentry
noises but I'm not paying attention to
where the sound is coming from just set
this up right here
where is that
get out of here come on over here whoa
whoa I was really sure that I got more
of that funky Christmas pastime
we use more we could pry use a heavy
more to get a level not terribly good
with the heavy
whoa yeah not tear over here I'm pretty
good at pyro I will be a pyro I will be
a pyro yeah yeah I feel comfortable at
this let's get this moving
No
riches and riches in Chicago tonight
stay tuned for Jack dice bass it's true
it's true I'm still getting my sea legs
like I said it's been it's been a good
couple of weeks if not more since I
played tf2
so I am what that and I saw it too so
I'm still getting get my old sea legs
back if you will and I know you will
we're gonna take down that century
that's gonna be priority number one
won't someone else well how about that
you see if I can get up there
I'm glad you guys got to see that this
is why and the act back that's true that
is true that's true dick the birthday
boy you are absolutely right so many
babies that rich Evans he puts a new a
new meaning to the word stud
all right all right we're here we got a
medic we got over
we're good to go let's just keep an eye
out keep an eye out on everything where
is everybody
I don't know get out of here that's fine
it's fine that you heard me
I'm okay with this
whoa whoa I really thought I had them I
did not what's here
what MLG team I don't fight now I am
certainly not good enough to play for
any team there's a while
there's a while where I was really
putting in a solid number of hours and
was thinking about joining a wall off at
Fogg I was thinking about joining
Highlander team because I was really
really putting in a time and I was
significantly better than I am now
but now I've moved on to just playing a
bunch of other games eventually I would
like to eventually I'd like to get good
enough again where I could get on I'll
and her team I'll and therefore anyone
who doesn't know is a team where you
just play one of every class
Oh protein what do you think you do
think you guys will do something with
Matt Hammond from samurai cop now that
he's resurfaced hopefully that would be
great I know he he's doing some
commentary for a new DVD and so he's
probably looking to do some publicity
which would be great well look into that
we will slash
keep thinking that I see over here
I keep thinking that I see enemy's
health bars
see like I did better that round not
great look better not great
all right let's get out of here let's
get out of here let's get out of this
one and let's um let's do this where is
what does that look like for you guys
nothing you just all you see is tf2
let's go online so you guys can see me
here
you guys yeah all you see is tf2 this is
this is great I'm I am uh for the first
time I'm actually capturing the game on
the computer that I'm playing on and it
seems to be working out significantly
better all the audio issues have gone
away okay I'm now online so we will try
to find so anyone who's steam friends
with me which is a lot of you hopefully
so now let's go back to a game it'll
blink for me but nothing will happen for
you so we'll go to servers and well I'll
just try to find like a big empty server
and see if we can if we can goof around
for a little bit like you guys want to
find a 2fort server but that'd be the
worst let's see if we can find an empty
32 player two forward server it'll be
dim
yeah come and play with me come and play
oh man
like here
let's just see capture the flag
underscore to see if we can find an
empty server
no they're all phone oh there it is see
okay here it is thank you and get on
this
oh that has BOTS we don't want everybody
you know on any bus
I hear ya
it's like a that's pretty high latency
let's see what we got here my max player
count 32
latency
100
a good server for us guys
oh here we go let's see if we can all
get on this
I'm driving I'm driving it to board
server so I think it's empty and so
basically you just go if your steam
friends with me you just you just click
and say join game I guess this is for
anyone this is it's weird that I'm
saying this get movie out here I'm gonna
be emblem alright I really hope this is
all you guys joining the game I'm sure
it is oh it is good yeah I see how many
Pre Rec yeah
we might we might crash the server we're
gonna see connection problems already we
are gonna see if we can all play
together or if we are gonna crash this
but yep okay crash sir we crash the
server everybody congratulations
so we're gonna try that again that was
great
that guy's probably getting new fields
right now budget gaming let's try this
one let's see if this one is any better
yeah I would this is exactly what's
gonna happen is we're just gonna all try
to hop on
and and we're just gonna crash
everybody's server
Oh guys we failed already did you get
that we owe you one

this early this seems like a ridiculous
time to be awake thank you I will defend
this for hate to choose between speed
and damage I was a duel
maybe next time
that's the thing the thing about tf2 is
a lot of it I think is about this kind
of meta game there's a very there's a
very solid game on top obviously and
anyone who wants to push the objective
you get a nice you get a nice experience
bond because it's been around for so
long because it has such a strong
community you get these meta games where
the game isn't necessarily about pushing
the objective it's about boxing on the
bridge I was so close so it's just one
of those things where this game is full
I want to change my glorious times are
your questions towards oh I have strange
fists oh I'm gonna do that build up my
