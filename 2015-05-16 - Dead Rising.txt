10:52pm: "Rich is at the tail end of a good Dead Rising no death run RIGHT NOW!!!" (archive.vn/Pih6b)

[Part I]
all right we should be streaming a game
I hope if this is all gone correctly
just know there's no guarantee it has no
guarantee at all no guarantees in life
looks like we're starting up that's
great
things are happening
tiny turnip you are mine my only viewer
right now in the the chat you're about
to go to work alright have have had fun
at work I I hope to still be playing
when you get back we'll we'll see what
happens
I think I think I might have at this
time all right
no to to start off we're gonna we're
gonna recap what happened last time I
tried this Dead Rising no death run I
know a lot of people in the chat what
sure let's start to fill up it's nice
that's nice you were probably here last
time
Monday night everybody well last time I
did this I was having a pretty good run
we lost a couple people a survivors died
but I was I was near the end of the game
and I think it was clear sailing for me
to the end before my xbox decided to
freeze on a loading screen so that's
that's not my last run I did we froze on
a loading screen so here's here's what's
going on this time last time I wasn't
saving specifically because I did not
want to overwrite my old game pretty big
gun rising fan and I didn't want to
erase everything I had unlocked and and
all of that jazz so I wasn't saving what
is different this time is I have now
created a new profile so we now have a
I'm playing on a special prereq profile
I made so this should save til its own
separate dead rising save file
I hope actually I know I kind of I kind
of tried earlier so we're good we're
good with saves the other thing I've
done this is the last time I flat-out
forgot that you could install games to
the damn xbox360 hard drive so my game
was was running from the disk last time
this time it's installed under the drive
so that should also keep out any any
freezing shenanigans I hope you're about
to go again
um I'm gonna have a great run it's gonna
be great run
hello everybody hello and I am not
skipping cutscenes if if you don't like
that you know what the door is we're
gonna rewatch all these things that we
already watched once because I enjoy
them hey buddy
you mentioned something about research
for a story that's right got a tip that
something bigs happening in a nowhere
little town like that they sure didn't
mention anything about it on TV
yeah well I'm freelance pal I don't make
new hobby
thank you for subscribing we really
appreciate it
eight months in a row I still haven't
figured out how to say that months part
and I got some singsong it doesn't work
but I appreciate great William at
Colorado population fifty-three thousand
five hundred ninety-four distinguishing
characteristic
Jack shit but the only thing to do in
this town Sears kill time
here's missing mom here's what's going
on in my head with with this know death
run I really want to play the other
games but I need I need to get through
this fucker first I need to do this I
need to know death run Dead Rising 1 so
I get let myself play Dead Rising 2
because so somebody actually gifted me
Dead Rising 3 which that was great that
was great they did it before it went on
sale like like a couple of days ago
Hotel before the Nationals so and that
was really generous take me over I want
to play through all the games I don't
know what I'm gonna know death run all
of them especially three just because
I've never played it before and I you
know I don't have familiarity with
what's going on in three so I need I
need I need to beat this so I can move
on to - I don't know if I'm gonna do
dumb I don't know if I'm gonna stream
it's I don't know I don't know just yet
if I'm going to uh stream a no death run
of of - I might I might I'm gonna be
easier than Dead Rising one
but I just I just want to play through
the whole series I got six points
because I zoomed out that sucks
and of course my my strategy here is
exactly the same as it was last time
a level up early and often
yeah I'm kind of sad you people know I'm
streaming so quickly it's kind of
amazing
shouldn't you shouldn't I be planning in
my wedding
there's here's what's yours what's going
on with that I really want to get
married to Carrie I love her to death
but as far as actual wedding plans I
whatever she wants is my answer whatever
she wants no idea one thing's for sure
because I love Roscoe and I want to get
married
I really do want to grow into it but I
mean in my eyes the actual marriage the
wedding that's just that's just a
ceremony I care less about that then I
do being able to just say never
hey I'd be happy to set a date she is I
don't know if I I think I explained this
once that dumb right when I came up to
Wisconsin to be more involved with red
letter media I mean we didn't we didn't
know how well this was going to work out
wasting a lot of photos on that okay we
didn't know if this is gonna work out
for me up here and it didn't make any
sense to to move her up here if things
were gonna go bad you know just had to
move back so I mean she stayed she's
still in in Chicago and she's she's
taking her sweet-ass time moving up here
but whatever she wants to move up here
that way that we can get specific
but children expert wants to know when
this started well we leave in a way we
haven't even really started yet I'm in
the game the game doesn't really start
so you're in the mall proper so where
you're you are at the beginning you've
missed nothing
and I didn't fuck up the exploding gas
station picture this time so I'm happy
about that
and even if I work trying to level up
quickly I still what's given don't skip
cutscenes you know this isn't really a
cutscene
I mean sigh EE what the skipper
I was I was going to wait till Monday
before doing this again but say I got a
mental why I want plate the second game
I can't I can't do that until I can get
through this fucker first this is the
thing that has to happen
I want to see the center of town take me
there
I've seen them all
judge bred the stream is crazy early for
one because this happens to be the time
we felt like the game got caught up with
what I had the dude into the studio
today and had some time on my hands
plus a day no death threat of dead
rising we'll take a second or so hours
so makes sense the startling raw nuts
listen don't forget to come and I'm
worried it's gonna be a dull spoon for
you guys because I'm gonna be playing
through a writing the same if I'm gonna
climb through all of the same shit you
saw me do last time we did this that
name cuz the hole near the fight
I really want to do a perfect run like I
really want to save everybody and
complete all old little errand missions
ploy one spot on the line can you bring
the money the safe room just like that
motion I want to do all that shit too
but besides you know I I will abandon
the myth time wise I don't think I can
do it without missing a little scoop or
another case zero my hair my fryer is my
third priority is not dying
I will only end the stream if I actually
died but I will not be happy unless I
get the true ending so second priority
do all of the the main story Case Files
third priority save everyone I can
I'm getting way out of it this time god
damn it I'm saving Leigh Leigh uh Leah
however you pronounce her name I'm gonna
save her yeah and I'm freelance already
saving everybody and then feel alone
completing their little errand quest
that's best thing near the bottom of the
priorities anyway and then um I don't
know if it's being but possibly but it
would be really cool if I can um end the
game at the at level 50 which is the
highest human level frank west if it
were just a riot but i'm that's that's
like the last priority because time not
even sure that's the more - that's
numerically physically impossible
extend through the game pity there's uh
something else I can't put my finger on
doesn't sound like civil disobedience
it's too quiet what most a thief
everyone's already did whistle fish both
games had the mega annoying
walkie-talkie but I don't care about
achievements so if I miss a message from
Otis I don't give a flying fuck because
you get an achievement for answering all
of the calls fuck that fuck that this is
my friend is hell
tgd Finnick I can't do a spiked bat
spike packs spiked bats don't come in
until uh until two there will be spikes
when I scream - I don't know like I said
I don't know if I'm gonna try no death
run on - I I'm a similar to how I'm
doing the Dead Rising one no death runs
on off days
I'm a stream a live play of the whole
game but I don't know if I'll guarantee
that'll be a new death run I've only
played through Dead Rising 2 twice
because my second time through white I
to save everybody and do all the case
files because Dead Rising 2 is like a
fuck
it's Dead Rising 2 is a metric fuck ton
easier it's it's one of my major reasons
why I prefer one yes III did have the
Megaman gun but but I think I think
that's safe file I Xbox go bad and I
think I lost the world hard drive to
everything and basically I'm playing on
this is my my third xbox because the
hardware on the Xbox is a piece of shit
and I don't think any of my old save
information was on this drive even
though I do have a fully level Frank
West Dead Rising I don't know I don't
know if I'm my my main save if I have
that unlocked the Mega Buster the real
Mega Buster but I did at some point even
if I did have that unlocked I wouldn't
be using it because this hold the whole
goal here is to try to do this starting
at level one so even if that were
unlocked on my other save we wouldn't be
able to use it and I don't know that I
would choose to use it I felt I feel bad
using the mini chainsaws
because they feel so cheap I'm gonna do
it cuz this run would be over real
fuckin bitch without it but
hey bring that over here
you guys you guys happy with the audio
balance sound of the game compared to
the sound I mean I did a test before we
stream that sound fine to me but I can
adjust the audio on things if you guys
want
hey this is no time to ogle pretty girls
son you're looking to get yourself beats
alive by a zombie sounds good great what
did you just say zombies take a look out
there your those ain't zombies what
would you call
there's been more and more of them since
last week she'll be happy to know that
when I spend blood rising - there will
be plenty of spice plenty of spice look
on the bright side zombies are stupid
and slow despite bad spy gloves we
should be spectral pain tanks all right
yeah we like making yourself useful take
a look around the mall now I know what
we can use for this is a witch heaven so
back here on delight pronto
hey my car off at home editing things
and those things made or inform a not
but probably may involve the new Mad Max
movie
fantastic which I am going to avoid Mad
Max spoilers so I'm not gonna talk about
it much but I I saw it I don't speak for
Mike or J but fucking awesome
I fucking love bad backs Mad Max was
great three time stream
oh you're streaming I'm streaming yeah
oh I got her and I got everything we
need for Marilyn why do this are you
leaving later Your Honor do come down I
don't even know what you're talking
about
I see you guys got excited when Jay
sherick and now you're always surprising
so sorry but Jay Jay's not going to want
to watch me stream this for 8 hours this
is not gonna work it might not work for
me because I would be tempted to talk
Jay I wouldn't be paying enough
attention to the game it might it might
fuck up the no death
all right all right stop Bahamut to do
twice one two three four times
oh there's one one freshness disgrace
nope alright whatever
the farm again
fantastic by aspirin
I'm gonna go back to Texas
Oh
well you're holding on well
time is of the essence of 95y stuff a
can with photographs and move on but
that did not work out that did not work
out
follow me follow me buddy stairs so you
take my pictures come on come on
they'll follow me up the stairs caught
on the railing they always do
fantastic
normally I can like 1000 it's not
working out it's not working out Oh
Baltimore
past
fast
fantastic
fantastic
a band
fantastic
fantastic
I know this is really unacceptable watch
but we are now working towards a goal
and welcome towards a goal
fantastic
such more pictures
fantastic
mr. smile
fantastic
fantastic
fantastic
I could be wrong hipster Superman but I
think we'll a man might actually be a
real town I think they named it after a
place but I could be wrong where are the
others
I don't know I hope they got away
also go see Mad Max
as long as those things are in the mall
I'm gonna say this about these do he
quote controversy unquote I know you
doing care what your politics are the
claims made about the movie they're just
they're just wrong actually and
apparently those things aren't smart
enough to use the Ducks if you if you
love or or hate wait a minute feminism
normally bends right in or whatever the
fuck in this war it's irrelevant Mad Max
is just a good action movie and Matt the
Mad Max characters every bit as
prominent and active as he was in the
road warrior probably more so nice
camera ru and the reason he doesn't say
much and the trailers because he doesn't
say much in the movie list and that's
the journalist that's impaling dozen
pictures ring
you really seem to know what you're
doing who are you guys anyway and what
are you I took that one near the
entrance that guy do something nice wiki
says Willamette is fictional least
Colorado Illinois okay no okay thanks
for showing me that I can't be right
about everything
uh hey we're not done talking yet met
mad max has the eyes some of the most
satisfying action scenes I've seen in
decades I'm Jesse the man you saw
earlier is Brad that's all I'm
authorized to tell you
to do master you want me to do my master
blaster I used to annoy my coworker on
my first job by doing master blaster who
runs Bartertown
Master Blaster Master Blaster
say again master blaster runs Bartertown
louder master blaster runs Bartertown
not yet energy
hey anybody around
Jeff stop crying and talk to me
stop crying I'll hit you with my bat
I know it's not a popular opinion but I
actually like Beyond Thunderdome
quite a bit mister yeah the first half's
better than the second but it's fine
movie I think overall even
fantastic yeah
by going for the Franklin pimp
achievement no I'm not going for any
achievement I'm just going for a no
death run no deaths save everybody
perfect ending if if possible do
everybody's fetch quest but I'm far less
certain about that over there if my time
limits getting really tight I'm not
gonna bother with giving so-and-so a
bottle of wine that said I'm gonna try
and make sure I do the side quests that
keep people from leaving because I'm
trying to save as many people as I can
yeah
okay stock priest five that's good
it's good that that happened
all right shut up Otis shut up shut up
Otis Otis shut up shut up okay there we
go late leah is not always doomed I
rarely lose lay up which is why I have a
so pissed and you know last time in the
convicts killer had a feeling you'd show
up
I I was going to wish it to the the
cornfield I'm so glad somebody got that
that reference did please don't turn me
into a jack-in-the-box up on me
Brad was attacked I located him on the
monitor oh it's probably just a sprain
I've got to help Brad or he's done for
all right fine
give me a gun come on I'm the reason you
just got hurt let me help
no I can't let us if you're known needed
the sky kids yeah well I don't because
in order for Mad Max to have some kind
of redemption some kind of character for
the trilogy know how to use this he
needed people to save he needed someone
to cover to redeem him by by saving the
children he gains bit he gains back a
little bit of his humanity
look after I'm through helping you you
that's why I like thunder nice little
chat obviously told wise it's way
different from road warrior and I love
road warrior because it's so fucking
brutal and cynical rich me tell you
about awesome man Max's oh yes not
spoiling anything I Baylor's hear that
people ringing endorsement
while C's zombie zombie stop
I'm going with the same general overall
strategy I use when I'm nearly there
deaf won the game for the Xbox decided
fucking over that means I'm going to be
making a lot of quickstep also cool fun
spots a town and and dare I say I might
like Tom Hardy more as Mad Max it's it's
actually much easier
it's actually almost a darker take on
Max and the original take was dark
one of our way in there
yes I know I know Mr Clegg it said that
dark isn't always good and that's true
however is a very appropriate format box
before I play the new Mad Max game I
might play it it looks bad your
girlfriend sent me to find you for one I
don't want to build my own car I want to
drive the fucking dog pursuit special I
just want to drive that car and Burnley
you lose that right away I'm gonna use
that gun
not every fighting system purse should
be the Batman fighting system so I'm not
looking forward to that
all right I'll cut it out from here I
don't know about Mad Max game the
shadows try to get close to the target
okay
and what am I supposed to do when I get
close tag you stop by the chat with the
best thank you happy to shoot the guy
Jack I'm gonna try this until I do it
off and I'm gonna keep trying dodgy
until I stay it off I don't think you
realise are you up to it how close I
came last time a lot better with a
camera but yeah I'll give it a shot all
right
next time you reloads I'll lay down a
suppressing fire I'm counting on you
make your way over there you see Jack I
want to play the other games in the
series when I'm just in the mood I'm
gonna I'm at a big dead rising price
psychologically I need to get through
this game first before I move on to two
I just can't let myself move on without
sit here way out
fuck off
Jack I see you in the chat and then your
you are completely and utterly full of
shit they already know that I've already
gushed
you see it so they make more movies with
practical effects I mean this movie
needs to be a success because the
effects that the action scenes are
fucking amazing like that last stretch
of the movie Moke most excited I've been
buy an action cinema years many years
you suck
when I play all of the Mad Max movies
it's not just max I mean they're all
good characters
and I know a lot of people like to say
that what's very self curiosa
stole the show I think the most
interesting character was probably nuts
the guy with the white white makeup
there's a lot of guys in white makeup
but the major one who had like full
white body makeup on got away
who was that anyway I don't know the
names of characters in the new Mad Max
is sort of silly yeah I know it's not
like the Mad Max movies with Lord
humungus and a Master Blaster
photojournalist and right they have an
explanation then you thanks bread
they've all done it and it's great sorry
I've got nothing to tell you
look
I don't know what Jesse told you but as
far as I'm concerned we're through
working together so you cover your
zombies mr. Schine smile the guy that
wanted to go to Val palace
you uh you guys are looking for someone
here aren't ya
who is that where did you help me I help
you
damn
you're one hell of a journalist aren't
you Frank
aha hedid yeah yeah go see bye max
please with enough please give them that
will be money people's privacy
I want everybody I trust to make a movie
like Mad Max and that max needs to make
money because oh how glorious would it
be if they started making kick-ass
brutal r-rated movies again
how glorious you win Frank let's work
together thank you thank you for wishing
me luck Chet Jesse and I are DHS agents
and yes we are looking for the man in
that picture you're with Homeland
Security is that guy a terrorist or
something
I took that picture of the entrance
Plaza right near the front doors lux the
guy from the zombie romance I have no
idea
I honestly don't know he was the same
actor I haven't seen this on people
you're talking about hey so do I have
your permission to cover this story or
not
rich do you wish you had a sassy black
sidekick instead of Jack I thought I
thought Jack was my my sexy black
sidekick checks black right
it's dumb and food why my not grabbing
food daddy a moving racing the clock
racing the clock I get in trouble as
waste one of my quick stuffs are my way
zombie scum
are you wasting time there's no can't
shoot them all go to the floor so we can
get them all we need to go exact tell
them faster now let's move now so much
to slept with my chance on my breath
very disappointed very disappointed
time for orange juice times roll
bread is actually faster than I have
kindly cut was interesting and wrap this
whole thing up
no I'm not leaving until you come
guarantee me safe passage us to open
these gates just open this gate offer
you protection I am not opening any gate
thank you for your sake crunch I can do
an overhead attack sir push broom
excellent doctor it's not it totally
breaks that you can do the interesting
attack actually the head breaks off and
then it turns into like a spear
well what happened you can't just arrest
him he turned down my offer to protect
him said he isn't going anywhere until
they can guarantee a secure route out of
you did I see Mad Max in 3d oh god no I
hate 3d Jessie I hate him the first
thing we need to do is to call for
backup
the few times I've seen a 3d movie I
spent I spent a quarter to half of the
movie like like pulling my mic my
glasses up and squinting at the string
because I know I don't think it's
comfortable at all why I hate 3d
the marketing 100
100
fantastic it wasn't worth power
like last time cuz my goal is the level
up quick I'm grabbing this book here
which gives me like a 25% increase in
the amount of points you get for doing
survivor related stuff and considering
I'm going to try and save everybody that
should net me some levels walk faster
level fantastic 25% faster yes I took a
photo of that tent because if you line
the camera up right you get a thousand
points for doing it
leveling up this part my strategy go
past the picture I just took of of Wendy
and her love spur album add thousand
points this this cartoon Fox thousand
boys fantastic level up see that's how
it works
yes this is a note that one I'm doing my
best to make this a perfect run we'll
see what happens
they should always go how you planned
first priority is not going second
priority is getting good ending third
priority is saving everybody now big
fourth priority is completely some
completing some of their side quest
e-type request
is it possible to beat the game without
killing a single zombie hmm technically
yes
I mean you could just wait on the roof
for three days to your helicopter
arrives we're gonna get a ship ending
and you'll just sit there for eight
hours doing nothing but you you will you
won't get an ending without an official
ending without killing a single zone as
far as trying through the main quest I
suppose in theory I wouldn't want to try
it never do madness I wouldn't be fun
madness
okay all right
shit that zombie go shoot that fucking
zombie are you suck yeah you should have
shot shut he wouldn't be grabbing you

normally have in this game
thank you very much I think that's
choose between that cream and a melee
weapon come on take picture of that door
and I'll get in the way of my door
picture
Oh
you're standing right there fuck it
damnit did I platinum bloodborne I don't
bother platinum in games I don't bother
with achievements I just play the game
and have fun
hmm so that's what dr. Barnaby said huh
the old codes not dumb he wants us to
call for help first we got a light out
or what
the signals being blocked i can't even
contact HQ on the emergency line so if
you want to get our hands on dr. Barnaby
we're gonna have to secure a way out of
here ourselves all right we've got to
deal with the situation we've been
handed the boneheads back at HQ might be
working on something too
there's a helicopter coming three days
from now at noon it's my note Rancic I
think in the context of this game it's
my fair to say that I run out a sword
service yes that's how I plan on getting
out of here all right then I'll see to
it that the DHS picks up the chairman
I'm not a concept of trophies I hate it
when trophies actually I hate it's going
on trophies have kind of replaced I'll
tell you which one lockable is an
actually content like business right now
Peter not hard and you get the SPECIAL
past you if we have to wait here for now
you get in the hard you get the trophy
that says you'll be done right Oh Mike
isn't alike
we'll get dark hour to be here tomorrow
morning you remember I want you to keep
this spider-man game on the PlayStation
we're doing the things that would
normally be achievements would give you
different costumes and sometimes the
different costumes would have different
abilities different powers like one
would make you stronger the the symbiote
calcium would give you unlimited webbing
funds fun stuff fun stuff that enhanced
game
it's a shining artifact of the past all
right I need this picture
fantastic and I need to make sure we
don't lose that picture and that's off
to save Sophie that's Accra Feist
I know on the other stream somebody
asked me why I take the elevator down
why don't I just go around and jump on
the shelves because you're trying to do
a perfect run in this game good name
enemies time and then I think it's just
a tiny bit faster to take you out of
here
maybe not even by that much but I think
it's faster and that's why I do it
Jack I see you argue against me in the
chest no if you without taking damage
instead of getting an achievement
wouldn't you rather get like the the
unlockable specially done with with
extra damage when you enter let me write
about looking rather unlock there
wouldn't you rather actual content as a
reward instead of pretend bragging right
content
there's no fucking shoot
anywhere near that fuck dude
I hear them I don't see them
the scared oh fuck I mean is what they
do
right Jack you say the alternative or
the alternative to no trophy is nothing
but that's that's not true before
trophies you did get things like in Dead
Rising this is one of the early Xbox
games what are your lure games that had
trophies its astrophys but it still has
regular content - like things that give
you trophies also give you unlockable
costumes unlockable weapons like this
the real Mega Buster that everyone talks
about
no both I'm fine with a boat but it's
like these days you don't get both you
just get the achievement and I think
that's because they think it's
acceptable just to slap a trophy one
there they can get away with it that's
why they're doing
Kofi's have come to replace unlockables
and content usually they don't grab me
once I've got thee one was about wasn't
holding somebody's hand
come on
alright didn't level up for that but
I'll take what I can get
so put down something in that business
I'll get you back fantastic business
taken care of hi
so many little details I can forget that
will cost me a perfect love through
incidentally for the record that that
picture I took that's for the Kent the
KITT mission is tomorrow if I want to
continue that storyline and I need to
because there is a survivor tied to it I
need to bring Kent a erotica photo worth
I think at least 750 points and that is
a photo worth 750 points there's a
better picture I can take later but may
as well may as well get the one I can
get now before I forget
all right we're off to the clone
of course they're right by the door and
that's not shocking the bastards
by hat - ivenn e-waste a quick stuff to
get around them I don't think I'll need
to
oh gosh
all right what do I need before the
cloud
yeah
Frank doesn't die when he gets shot
because video game logic we all know
this we all know this
I'm discovering that I have greatly
underestimated be regular chainsaw gonna
tie this up first roof later viewers and
they watch this
Oh mr. Superman you say that the regular
chainsaw finnie minimus I'm not argue
that minis are a lot more useful but
I've discovered some things about the
regular chainsaw as hard as well against
this boss but later on I will I will
endeavour circuit only rarely the
regular chainsaw has it over mini
chainsaws that be much later if we get
that I going off to sleep now and do
other things
have a nice night
like wow
onde oh wow the last shot at program I
told them that was fucking great
yeah
Hokkien before the lights went out I'm
very happy about that
yeah
all right so that's the first thing the
regular chainsaw has you don't sleep
there's not really a pause before swings
so you can you can just keep hitting
that that button yep still be moving so
it's like continual damage which is nice
we have Greg to the egress
don't they call that where you going
why are you going back right going back
the way forward is is forward Greg
they waste all this chainsaw juice
hello
as technically he's not joined the group
yet that's fine that's fine
yet another secret stream we're trying
this again we're gonna do it this time
cuz I'm fuckin determined
what are you doing
fantastic
yes I appreciate Roger I'll get you back
come on
come on
come on
over there where the fuck are you guys
get in here
come on all right
follow me
follow me you guys stuck in there Shinji

get them zombies
I need some things from you guys I'm
gonna need my shit back Roger
yeah
follow me
follow me
get up there
who
yo Frank give me a hand here what what
gives
considering the helicopter and all we
have to work together
but that doesn't mean I'm gonna make
another quick step and we kept saying
that gun store can't necessarily be
printed yeah so so I just want you to
appreciate the situation well we're up
to our necks and zombies yeah I think I
appreciate the situation just fine
zombies I still can't believe all this
you know seems so unreal how's the beer
coming along I trimmed it today it's
still there for now
you all right there yeah I got it
you should rest a while Brad
you go ahead and catch some sleep first
we can switch in four hours okay
yeah
Oh
day one has gone well with they tease
when it starts getting real
I believe that chainsaw is my weak water
that I used a bus Shh hey I hear like a
server many times I hate using the
muchachos they feel they feel so cheap
yeah you you can't speedrun this game
the clock for the helicopter is gonna
come about when it comes about you can't
increase the speed on that
should have went the other way
she went to the park I might take this
back was done but I think it matters
yes for anybody who wasn't here earlier
Mad Max not gonna spoil anything fuckin
awesome it's so awesome it's awesome
what does that mean but it's awesome
you speed up
look mister if we're gonna fight these
zombies we need guns electrician named
zombies bad as far as I can throw that's
just people even less don't shoot
look let's pop this open talk to my
12-gauge don't get no closer I'll blow
y'all to kingdom come
you know god damn it I warned you a
situation like this nobody yeah
yeah
damn mister come on now what are you
crazy
you want you want good so bad that y'all
yeah
a perfect
fantastic
fantastic oh shit I got the Japanese
book oh fuck
all right all right that's not a big
deal using a lot of fucking points
though
yeah
Oh
I think I got enough time to kill I can
do this I'm going to go back before
going to the safe house I'm bringing
this guy all the way to the bookstore or
I can get more points for rescuing
survivors because like an idiot
I dropped the wrong book I dropped the
wall whose book and instead of the
Japanese language book which I didn't
need the boiler my gun
so everyone I've rescued since then I
got 25% less prestige points than I
would have very disappointing
ah
he's looking up at chef I almost I miss
right off without you David
why didn't write it you spawn in my arms
I needed to go this way to make quick
step anyway I know I gotta carry your
centerboard I'm like I never come back
again
you get knocked out of my arms right now
I want a cuddle
yes I'm going to save this time the
reason I didn't last time is because I
didn't want to overwrite my actual
normal dead rising save with all my shit
that was unlocked this time I started a
new profile which apparently will let me
have a second safe so we're good we're
good
that's good stop worrying
I'm even installed on the hard drive now
so in theory it shouldn't be a problem
at all
I'll just play out of my way first a few
thousand extra points and then nuts in
that cookie wrong wrong store wrong
store
I won't have to wrap something
the reason I'm getting through these
crowds so easily is that the advantage
of carrying somebody is the game goes a
bit easy on you when you carry a
somebody they'll they could still swipe
at you but they don't do the grab news
so I'm kind of immune that grabs right
now
they actually survivors you have to to
carry are actually a lot easier to
escort than the garden-variety you don't
want to you don't want to be escorting
two cripples at once though that's bad
one purple at a time that's that's my
rule
I've heard text on school I cannot see
myself
all right
I have time to make a quick step before
the next mission starts I'll be happy
I've lost out on a lot of lemon just
that I'll make up for I'll make up for
it
eventually considering I lost a layout
last time we on the whole we might be I
might be even did I go too far
just usually don't go around that way
it's time to make quick-set that did it
you've got to be worth a decent amount
points
follow me
Thanks
yeah-oh upgraded my throw that's great
there's everybody everybody happy
everybody's happy we've saved Frank
West's head his nap everything's good
so you're betting on my xbox red ringing
huh all right
as possibility this is my third fucking
expose cuz they are pieces of shit
the reason I still have my xbox eight
eight xbox or it's not mine that I feel
is mine just like food it's because it's
dead right because it's this game and
kind of Ninja Gaiden 2 remembers a
version of that on ps3 they did suck all
the blood out of it though because
stupid just because stupid
fantastic I saw something you may not
know toy laser sir doubles as a
flashlight doesn't do much damage though
so rare I got da extra time in this game
whatever boobs do I have unlocked here
and don't I have any of my grappling
stuff yet oh I got two of speedups
that's not bad that's not bad at all
that's gonna help a lot the key speed
now a football tackle man yeah
best stay on my orange - fun is where I
get shit done and my my territory
hunters no way I'm gonna eat that pie
now it's just that's just that's just
not gonna
no I've never used one of these chairs
as a weapon I'm gonna get super
ineffective you know a frank list or a
smarter man he'd be dealing more looting
right about now
fantastic
oh thank you behind me
but fantastic you get to the safe
playtime is over I would have liked to
have had more I wanted to go to the food
court and there's a bunch of things you
can do in the food court to get prestige
points but that shouldn't the
shenanigans with David I didn't have
time I could probably do some of that
stuff later
fuck 6:00 a.m. what time is it
I got we got time
well you got time
Hey
hey don't eat that Thanks
hey you saved my life
wait what are you doing in here with
those two losers they like your parents
or something but she just keeps crying
and crying I wouldn't want to be stuck
in that room oh my god right
oh my
as bradon's come this on these but you
know that get out
what does I'm actually gonna choose to
talk to you for a change
I understand
Oh
what
got 15 in-game minutes to kill
this will give you a good idea of what
game time it was compared to real time
ah I don't have really enough time to go
kill zombo's oh my god I've got I've got
seconds I've got seconds to go maybe a
minute I get like make it down the
elevator and then come back up I want to
be liked by this door on the neck
mission when the next mission comes up
so I'm not wasting any fucking time big
Ron the maximum number of people you can
save in this is 53 but that's only if
you actually get one of them the less
good endings if you want to get the best
possible ending than most people you can
save as 51 which is what I'm going for
I have not lost any survivors yet right
now oh shit
talking to you guys door open and then
the time oh hi oh my god oh my god I
know everyone is alive I'm having a
perfect run so far I've made some
mistakes but it hasn't caused me any
survivors drop the wrong book and that
pissed me off good what's going on
anyway before this whole thing started
someone called the professor and told
him to come to this mall check the line
did you
Kaspar why what why why are there less
survivors for the best ending look watch
the game and find out bees don't date
I don't know need to apologize
buttermilk biscuits my fault I mean guys
if you default of course be none of our
questions will be answered
let's go make up for that second I lost
am i doing overtime mode probably yes
that's that's presuming that something
doesn't go home as long if nothing goes
horribly wrong we are doing overtime get
out of my fucking way no time Otis no
time
don't be daydreaming out here
so much if people don't know what
overtime Moto's don't let don't tell
them in the chat it will hopefully find
out Pachamama
it's the professor
if we don't do something professor is
gonna end up zombie chow
I'm going for it you just worry about
staying alive got it I hope I don't run
into that bug again during this fight
last time I did this I almost glitched
myself to death I got caught in a taking
damage animation and I kept losing
health it was not fair at all but why
should we expect life to be fair oh you
fucker
no chances no chances never seen him do
that shoulder bumps so much he's
unconscious but alive all right you know
can you get him back to the security
room
oh my god
the sedatives taken effect the professor
won't be waking up anytime soon
brat is apparently the only person in
this game who is not mostly immune to
bullets I managed to stop the bleeding
but he's running a fever
he needs medicine
a fever
medicine huh people on the check
don't don't spoil plot elements of this
game for people just don't this games
too fun either watch me do it
or do it on your own cuz this games good
well you shouldn't track it down
fantastic fantastic fantastic fantastic
fantastic
fantastic
fantastic so if you wanna know how
Japanese this game is look at look at
Frank's nosebleed
yeah
she can hear you but she's she's totally
focused on Brad I think she's got the
hots for Brad I don't I don't think
Frank chance stands most of a much of a
chance
oh it's time for orange juice
just heal
oh I mean you do that
up capture froze hold up
hold up
I see I see I'm working on it I'm gonna
start stop the stream and start the
stream

[Part II]
All right.
Are we live?
Is everything back?
Words, words are being heard.
What did I do?
What did my computer do?
My computer started freaking out.
Uh, I'm kind of an-, annoyed, actually.
It seems, like, the, uh, USB 3.0 ports on the back of my ports just decided they don't wanna work.
I move my computer around a lot.
I'm assuming the connections just got loose inside there.
I'm not gonna fix that now, but, I think, I think I just need to...
Hold on.
I think I just need to open 'er up and re-secure everything.
But I'll, I'll do that later.
For now, I'm just using a different set of ports.
And I'm going back to the game.
Yeah, you can, you can mock my, my craftsmanship if you want, but, uh, PC, desktop PC's weren't meant to be moved two or three times a week.
All right.
Otis, if you call again, and I'm almost in the grocery store, I'm going to beat you.
All right, also, I apologize, after my computer went down, I had LeftoverBeefcake's program running that stores who subscribed, and, uh, lost the names of everybody who subscribed during, um, the stream.
And I'm, I'm horribly sorry.
But you people, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
However number of months you've been subscribed.
PlasmaWave, TabooriHK...
Who else, who else?
Who else?
Thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Therobroy, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Ehh, fuck.
That could've gotten bad.
Ooh, what skill did I get?
Oh, I don't need food.
I leveled up.
Nice.
Oh, Judo Throw.
That one sucks.
I, I can never pull off, as much as I play this game, I can, I can never get the hang of that Judo Throw.
Downward, repeatedly.
I'll try again.
It never seems to work.
Guitar's a fun weapon.
I know it's not hooked up to a speaker.
It's not plugged into anything.
But I love, I love the subs.
It's like I'm that guy from Mad Max, which you should all go see immediately.
They make a good movie for a change, and it needs to make money.
Because Mad Max is fucking awesome.
I'm not gonna spoil things for anybody, but I'm gonna gush about that all night.
I'm not gonna stop.
The, someone in the chat is asking me if I have control over what gets upgraded, or if it's random.
It's semi-random.
Like, you're, you're never gonna get, like, the, the move that rips a zombie's guts out.
You're never gonna get that early, so there's, it's kinda, like, ones you're a lot more likely to get early and, and things you're not going to get until later on, but there's, it is randomized.
Like, you don't know if you're gonna get an attack upgrade, or a health upgrade, or a speed upgrade, or a new move.
You're, you're not sure what you're gonna get.
Otis, I don't have time for your bullshit.
I've got a security room to get to.
Oop, sorry, Tonya.
Tonya, I don't see you moving.
Deposit Ross.
Now move your ass.
Oh, okay.
All right.
You're right behind me.
That's a good thing.
We want you right behind me.
Run, don't walk, Tonya.
No, No!
What are you doing?
Tonya, stop crying.
It's a door.
Run to it.
Yes!
Stop killing those zombies!
We're right by the door.
I'm on the clock.
Oh, Otis.
How I hope you die horribly.
So much to do before this day is up.
I hope that didn't fuck me.
That took a lot of time, a lot of time.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Motherfuck.
Do I have time?
I'm gonna need it.
I'm gonna need it.
Okay.
They're earlier than I would like.
I'm not gonna have time for Gordon.
I'm not gonna have time.
And that's not what I wanna do.
Whatever.
I love and hate this game in equal measures.
Oh, boy.
I need to get to Gordon, quick.
Gimme my chainsaw.
Oh, there it is.
All right.
Don't wanna lose that.
All right, all right, all right.
I wanted to get Gordon, and then run into the twins, but it didn't work out that way.
I hope I have enough time to get to Gordon and back before missing out on this case.
Oh, god.
I hope I don't miss out on this case.
Oh, I meant to delete one of you.
One more inventory slow, I don't...
I can do this.
I can do this.
This can be done.
This can be done.
This is all within the realm of possibility.
I have to hit you again.
Gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
We have not lost anybody yet.
We are currently perfect.
Whoo, boy.
Just a little bit behind schedule
Not super happy.
But, in the scheme of things, not bad.
Not bad.
Uh, someone in the chat is asking, is this a no-death run, or a no-one-dies run?
It's the same.
I'm trying for both.
If, if somebody dies, I'm still gona do a, a no-death run where I don't die.
But my goal is not to lose anybody.
I don't know that I'm gonna pull it off.
I've never pulled that off.
Yeah, I know, for the best ending, a couple die.
I'm not, I'm not counting that, those storyline deaths.
So, whatever.
I think, I think no matter what, you can't save everybody, in any of the, the, the other ends.
Um, I think the best you can do is 53 people rescued out of 54.
Cuz somebody survives one ending that doesn't survive the other, and whatnot.
All right.
Back into the breach.
I wanted to do...
I did remember to take a photo of the air duct.
I don't...let me make sure I remember to save it.
I did save it.
Yes.
Time is of the essence.
How much have I got for the photo challenge?
Enough.I can do it.
Day two is such a pain in the ass.
Fuck it.
Oh, I'm so close to it.
So close to leveling up.
But, whatever.
Whatever.
Yes, I am, I am solo tonight.
Mostly because I am, I'm seriously going for this no-death run, hopefully perfect run, and it would be distracting.
I'm going with Michael Rooker.
All right, all right.
Time, time, time.
Oh, shit.
I don't have my gun.
I didn't get it back from Courtney.
That was so dumb.
Fuck.
Where are you at?
Where are you at?
Time, time, time!
Where, where did he get bombs from?
Obviously, he made them with his Vietnam knowledge.
Cutscene monologues are okay.
I don't think time moves when you're in cutscene.
I don't wanna miss out on the case file.
Oh, I have plenty of time for that.
What are my, I'm short on time for something...
Oh!
Kent!
Fucking Kent.Kent makes everything horrible.
I can do it.
I can do it.
And I'm opening those doors out so they don't get caught on them, because they always get caught on the fucking doors.
Take...take the weapon I'm handing you.
We'll need these.
Where's Josh?
Where is he, where is he, he's about to, he's, all right, you're here.
Come on.
I got clean sailing.
Run faster.
That's right, Rich, you hit them with that 2x4.
You, Rich, who is not affiliated with me, who is also Rich.
Nice.
All right.
Kent.
And then, other.
Actually, you guys, you guys just wait over there.
I'm not fucking around with you guys.
Oop, sorry, Kent.
All right.
Yeah, ApatheticOne, if I play this game well, it's because this is amongst my favorite games of all time.
I fucking adore Dead Rising.
So I've, I've got experience.
Oh, shit.
I've gotta feed you.
Suppose I've got nothing up here.
Cabbage in there, something fucked up?
That'll do.
Go to the waypoint.
Don't sit around like an idiot.
Who's getting eaten now, Ronald?
Haha!
Go, go, move, run!
All right.
I'm trying to...
Fuck it.
One more person to rescue before another source.
All right, do it.
If you all cooperate with me.
All right.
Whoo, boy.
What's going on over here?
Nothing?
All right.
What skill did I get?
Dammit.
How many days in are we?
We're about halfway through day two.
And also, I, I have been saving this time.
I've been saving at the beginning of new cases, mostly.
If I'm gonna have a perfect run, timing is tight.
I can't afford to run off to save constantly.
I may glitch out.
We'll see.
Yes, these guys, these, these guys here, these cultists, they can hit you with knockout gas and kidnap you.
Which, if that happens, that's gonna fuck my entire run.
These guy in, in the back of my head, I'm, I"m terrified of these guys.
Will I be getting the Mega Man stuff?
I'm probably not gonna bother.
Actually, I'm playing from a fresh profile.
I don't think I even have the, the costume unlock, so...
Yes, I know Frank is an ass, but really, that's what makes it interesting.
All right.
Oh, shit.
There we go.
All dead before they can use knockout gas.
I'm good.
Always hold hands.
Fucking wall of zombies.
I could not get through.
That's awful.
That was just awful.
Remember, Rich, if the zombie apocalypse breaks out, just hold your fiancee's hand, says Cosper.
You know what, I, I'll, I do that anyway.
Aww.
Awwwww.
I'm saying aww for you.
Just, yeah, assuming.
All right.
Stock up, always good.
Love that stock.
What are my skills looking like?
What's unlocked?
Ooh, Double Lariat.
Ooh, Roundhouse Kick, and Lift Up.
All right, those are all good things.
Getting the hang of that Judo Throw.
I am almost out of chainsaw.
All right.
I think I'm going to go make some quick before another source comes up.
I'm definitely not gonna try and rescue anybody from Wonderland Plaza right now, because that...not enough time
Not enough time.
I'm gonna cut and run there.
Activate the next story thing first.
Also, because of Ronald, I gotta remember from this point forward to always carry a food item with me because, uh, his, his little side quest thing, his little request from the office, if I don't give him food, I'm gonna lose a whole bunch of survivors.
So when I get that call, I'm gonna want food on-hand.
So there are chips in my inventory, and there they will stay.
Eh, I'm not even gonna make a quickstep.
I think I'm just gonna fool around for a bit.
Oh, shit.
They found me.
All right.
Playtime's over.
I could try and kill them now, but honestly they'll just respawn.
I, I may as well wait until after midnight.
In the meantime, I have a scythe.
Really?
Why are you in here?
I want other sources.
They have to start pretty soon.
I'm not even gonna fuck around.
Just go straight to there.
Have I gotten every Dead Rising achievement?
I think just by naturally playing it, I'm, I'm close.
But I don't, I don't go out of my way to get achievements.
I really just don't care that much about them.
The fat man only demands food once.
Well, technically twice.
He demands it before you can recruit him.
But after you get him in the security room, there's a, a special thing that pops up later where he will demand food, yes.
So it's the, the one item of food to recruit him, then one to placate him, after he's already, already, uh, been in your safe house.
Safe room?
I guess it's not really a house.
And, save.
See?
See, we are saved.
Yeah, the new, the new Wolfenstein is good?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to try the new Wolfenstein.
Fine.
Eh, shit.
Shit.
Ooh, that could be bad.
That could be bad.
I have to hope my chainsaw lasts me through Isabella.
That could be bad.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Now, now I've gotta get through one of the most difficult bosses in the game, and my magical chainsaw might break?
Oh, I could do...I got time.
I'm gonna do Above the Law first.
That'll solve that problem.
I'm not gonna risk it.
As much as I wanna get the story quest out of the way first, just to be safe, I can't risk it.
I should have kept that queen, then.
Well, you know what, I got the...we'll be fine.
Yeah, the order I wanted to do things in is gonna be slightly different, but perfect run is still doable, and...
Oh, that stupid little throw.
Work one of these days.
Any of you guys gotta queen?
Give me a queen?
Queen?
No queen zombies.
How about over here?
Nope, nope, nope, and nope.
Oh, well.
I'll do this the hard way.
We just picked up that chainsaw, too.
Eh, shit happens.
Any of you guys got a hunk of meat on you?
Haha, yeah!
Fucking awesome!
Nick, I'm sorry I don't have a shotgun to give to you.
I know, I know I can't blame you Nick.
I don't have a shotgun to give you.
Here.
It'll still suck, but it's the best I can do.
Best I can do.
Nick, where are you?
Paula Blart, mall cop?
More like Paula Blart, mall lesbian.
Mall, Paula Blart, mall lesbian rapist.
Not as fun as a movie.
Yet still more interesting.
Yeah, I, I know that chainsaw is overpowered.
That's, that's why I'm using it.
I, I feel so cheap doing it, but because I'm going for a no-death run, I, I feel like it's warranted.
First step, everybody get outta the store.
Out of the store.
All right, good.
I do not have a Knee Drop yet.
Shame.
Shame.
All right, I know you guys like getting stuck on those stairs, so now, everybody, get off the stairs.
All right, now we're off the stairs.
Now we're going down the hallway.
Follow my finger.
Just don't pull it.
Stop shooting, Nick.
Run.
Run, run to the, run to the thing.
We're going to the place.
The place where I pointed.
Too much enthusiasm.
I wish I had a better weapon to give ya.
Don't forget, forget my hand-to-hand moves.
That's what happens when you start at level one.
Ooh, I didn't mean to do that.
Get in the bathroom.
Get in the bathroom.
I think that's everybody.
I hope that's everybody.
Whoo.
Nobody better die on me.
Sally, move your butt.
Janet, stop pushing zombies.
Get into the elevator.
This game will give you some stress.
Now we play the climb-up-the-stoop game.
Did one of you fall down?
I don't care who, but someone climb up.
Oh, Jesus.
All right.
I gotta talk, take a nap.
Taking a nap.
Oh, Throw got upgraded.
Ain't that great.
All right.
Yeah, if I have one actual complaint with the game, it's that stoop, that stoop AI.
If they can fix that, I would have zero problems with the game.
I'm a go to Isabela.
All right.
What'd I get?
What'd I get?
What's my goodie?
Lift Up, Knee Drop.
All right.
All right.
Suplex, eh.
Knee Drop, good.
Here we go.
How far am I?
I'd say the halfway point's fair.
I hate this fight so much.
It's, it's bullshit.
It's, basically, it's just bullshit.
Oh, stop for one second.
Ole!
Why don't I have a gun?
Because I haven't had time to grab one.
Besides, chainsaw is still quicker.
I can skip cutscenes, but I'm not going to.
It's my quirk, and I like it.
Besides, these cutscenes are, like, the only fucking break I'm getting.
All right, VeryEuphora, you think the story in this is awful?
I respectfully disagree.
I actually quite like the story of this game.
Uh, someone else, I think it was TheCobraism, thinks that Isabela doesn't look human.
You think she looks like a werewolf.
I think Isabela is one of the hottest women in all of gaming.
I'm a strange dude because I'm attracted to, uh, dark-haired women?
Let's go to the other one.
Blender.
Need a blender.
Fuck off.
For shame.
All right, now at the start of the stream, earlier on in the stream, I was talking about the, the unappreciated benefits of the large chainsaw.
I am going to show you one of them in a minute.
Eh, all right.
I got my Ronald food, that's okay.
I hope to god I don't forget to feed him, though, when I came back.
That would be bad.
Yeah, Otis, I get it.
I get it, Otis.
I can't tell you how long I've been playing.
I don't remember what time I started.
Yeah, we're, we're still streaming tomorrow.
This is all, this is all on me, this stream.
All right, let's go see some chainsaw magic.
Well...
All right, maybe not.
When this works, it works great.
All right.
I know this works.
Once you're chasing them, after they're running, you just keep using the...like that.
I did this once, and I didn't get shot quite so many times.
Roger...
All right, it wasn't as smooth as I wanted that to be, but it worked, dammit.
Uh, can you save Thomas?
No, you cannot save Thomas.
There is a boss you can save, though, which is fun.
Get off that stoop so I can hold your hand.
Always hold hands.
Can you ignore Thomas?
No, because then you're not gonna be able to save this guy in here.
He won't, he won't join you until the other snipers are dead.
So Thomas is just, he's fucked.
It's a shame.He's kind of a somewhat sympathetic, Thomas, but, it is what it is.
Oh, no!
I didn't mean to do that to you, Jolie!
I'm sorry, I was going for the zombie!
Okay, there should be zombies up here.
Is Wayne caught on something?
You wait there.
Oh, he just hasn't joined yet.
Can I stream my stolen Grand Theft Auto some more?
Uh, yeah.
Not right now.
Actually, wait, I need you to come in, Jolie.
Come on.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Are you glitching on me?
You guys wait outside.
I don't want you guys to get stuck in this door.
I'm gonna talk to Floyd for an hour and a half until he's ready to join.
Fortunately, we're doing really good on time.
Grand Theft Auto 5, no-death?
Nope.
Uh, SpookyDooky, to answer your question: no survivors lost.
We are currently on a perfect run.
And I am going to remind myself again: don't forget to feed Ronald.
I know that's a strange thing to say, but it's, it's kind of important.
Just join, Floyd!
Fuck!
Grab a thord.
Go outside.
Wayne, I've got good news.
You're getting a battle axe.
Floyd.
Oh.
I'd like to pause for one moment while I'm right here.
I may as well do this.
I just know you idiots are gonna go down the, the up escalator.
I just, I just know it in my heart.
My heart.
Don't forget to feed Ronald.
Also, don't forget to feed Ronald.
Someone's getting grabbed up here, one second.
There was a bee.
It was a zombie.
It's gone now.
It vanished.
It despawned.
Oh, there's the bee.
I just can't reach it.
Get down...there we go.
There we go.
Almost forgot about Ronald.
Gotta keep reminding myself to feed Ronald.
Cuz that would be bad.
That would be, almost be enough to make me wanna quit.
Wayne, that's good, but don't, don't hit our allies.
Because it sucks when your allies hit you, doesn't it?
Rachel, where the fuck are you going?
And why are you going there?
What happens to Ronald if he doesn't eat?
Uh, the room he's in, every survivor in that room is going to leave with him to find food, and then they're all going to die.
Because they get eaten by zombies when they go out to find food.
Ronald is basically in the middle of starting a mutiny right now.
And the only way he'll stop mutinying is if I feed him, because he's a fucking pig.
If this game was Japanese, then I'd have to find out that Americans are fat.
Fat, lazy, and horrible.
That's the message that you're supposed to take away from this game.
Floyd, are you still back there?
Who's being grabbed?
Okay.
Feed Ronald.
Don't forget to feed Ronald.
Most important thing here is to remember to feed Ronald.
And I have my bag chips out and ready to go.
Can't forget this.
Get outta my way, get outta my way, get outta my way!
Oh, my god.
Yeah, you're right.
I might eat those chips by accident.
Oh, my god.
First thing I'm doing, after this cutscene, is switching items.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Transect, you say, oh god, this game is actually about the war on terror.
No.
Actually, this game is actually about how fat Americans are.
You'll see as we get there.
But the real plot is about how fat we are in America.
I say we.
I'm assuming not everybody is from the United States of America.
All right.
Item switched out.
Get to Isabela, and I, I even got time to kill.
All right, gotta feed Ronald.
Ronald McFuckface.
Yes, he just pushed me.
I, I have him tolerate it.
I don't really have much choice.
Oh, I'm sure there are parallels between this game and the War on Terror, I'm just saying, you'll see.
It's, it's about, it's about what we eat, it's about how, how gluttonous in, in, in general, United States is.
Selfish, and, and, and selfish gluttonous.
Because this game is Japanese, and that's how they feel about us.
Americans are so fat and stupid!
Let's make a game about it.
They won't even notice.
It's been a while since I've used the katana.
Eh, we're good on health.
I'm gonna say two quicksteps is acceptable.
I'll make more later if I have to.
What am I doing?
What do I need to do?
What should I be doing?
I'm gonna go to the food court.
We're gonna kill time at the food court.
I'm gonna keep some, uh, wine, in my inventory, cuz there's another, it's, am, um, you know, it's not a side quest where you're in danger of losing people like you are with Ronald.
Cuz if I didn't feed him, everyone in that room with Ronald would have disappeared, and they'd all be dead.
Don't wanna risk getting knocked out.
You get 500, uh, siege points for everyone of those guys you kill, but I, I'm, I'm not risking getting knocked out at an inopportune time.
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna replace my chainsaw.
Yes, that's, yeah, this game thinks all Americans are either fat or mindless zombies.
Yes.
That's the central theme.
I'll just go through here.
Nice.
Wall Kick?
Eh, that sucks.
So, so situational.
Comically so.
Judo Throw does not fucking work.
All right, I'm just, uh, running around, earning some spare points while killing time.
I don't wanna kill too much time.
Nope.
Didn't want you.
I think you get something for using every blender you get.
But I'm not even close to that.
Maybe I am.
And, uh, now because I rescued Floyd, the old guy I was carrying around, I'm gonna start carrying a bottle of wine to fulfill one of his requests later on, though nowhere near as urgent.
That is the one for Ronald.
Ronald McFuckface.
All right.
Few minutes to spare.
So how's everyone doing?
Yes, I am going to kill the card guy sometime after midnight.
But it's not after midnight just yet.
Or even, even if it is, I gotta be here for Isabela.
Which is right now.
How many people were in this town again?
53 odd-thousand? Maybe 54?
There is an achievement for killing over that many zombies.
Yes, that, that achievement is how you get the Mega Buster.
I've gotten it before.
It's boring.
You basically have to drive around in the tunnels with the car for, like, six hours.
Is the Mega Buster fun?
It's, it's amusing.
It's extremely powerful.
It kills the bosses in, like, one shot.
No, I'm, I need that chainsaw.
Something else has to go.
Shoot that zombie.
There we go.
Otis, fuck off.
I'm not answering.
All right, Kindell.
Normally, you're a great survivor.
Get it in gear.
I already told you no, Otis.
Isabela, don't get in my way when I'm swinging around a chainsaw.
Probably clear this area out then.
That throw never works.
Never works.
I gotta stop trying.
Fucking dayglow worms.
Oh, shit.
I'm too early.
Fuck.
I'm thinking if I want to try and...no, I don't.
I'm gonna wait.
I'm gonna rate, wait.
It's just about time.
Person in the chat, it's, it's impossible to do a Dead Rising speedrun.
Maybe you could overtime mode a, a little more or a little less...uh, what, what just happened?
I'm, I'm wondering if I have time to rescue people before the, that Santa Cabeza mission comes up.
I'm gonna say no.
No, I think I do.
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try cuz I'm so stupid.
Why am I so stupid?
I am so stupid.
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna try and do this.
Oh, god.
Oh, why?
Why am I dumb?
Why am I so dumb?
Yeah, the gun people.
I'm gonna try and go for the gun people.
All right, you guys need to hurry up cuz we got a long way to go to the security room.
Yeah, Alyssa, shut up.
Just to get the door.
Get to the door.
Get to the door.
Door.
Oh, I'm getting close.
All right.
It, it is a way, I think.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Time is a fire in which I wil l burn.
Why are the guys armed to the teeth always the most difficult to save?
Oh, man.
You guys better be on that stoop before time runs out.
Get up here.
Climb up.
Climb up faster.
Climb up the stoop.
I have not forgotten the wine.
Thank you for reminding me, though.
Uh, DickNeutral, it depends on what game you sent me.
Or Jack, I guess you're talking to Jack.
Jack looks like he's back.
Hi, Jack!
Uh, ConquerBeard, not only did I save Leia this time, so far I have saved everybody.
This is a Dead Rising god run.
Uh, HellCopter, the only achievement I'm going for is my own sense of achievement and satisfaction.
I am going to have a fucking Dead Rising perfect run starting from fucking scratch.
And, the money shot.
I love this game.
All right.
Back in the saddle.
Give, uh, wine to man.
Ooh, I got Neck Twist.
All right.
All right.
Convicts, theater, and then things are looking good.
Probably do theater first.
Yeah, theater first.
Saving people is paramount.
All right.
Ehh, no.
No, I want me a big gun.
Fire those motherfuckers.
Am I going the right way?
Okay.
Yeah.
I think that's the right plaza.
Oh, I should have taken the...oh, well.
It's not a big deal.
I only lost a miniscule amount of time.
Should've, should've driven the Jeep here.
Sorry if I have not been talking too much this stream.
I, I'm in it to win it, baby.
My brain, my brain is in the game.
That was...cocky, cocky, cocky.
Don't wanna lose my gun.
Ugh, fuck!
Yeah, all mixed drinks heal.
It's not just...hold on, I have to deal with some assholes.
I feel like this is a good use of my machine gun.
Talk to me, chat, while there's still time.
All right, I got my book that makes survivors more courageous, and I got two guys armed with shotguns, and a lady with a chainsaw.
Let's see what this does.
Get out of my way!
For fuck's sake.
Why am I a jerk?
And you fuckers can't get through the front door.
Shoot the zombies.
All right.
Now you're getting the hang of it.
Use those guns I gave you.
They're doing great, but I'm fucking up.
All right.
Come on.
You guys are supposed to be my ass-kicking squad.
Not a lot of good this book is.
Haven't got acoustic very much.
Not as fun.
Sorry, I thought you were a zombie.
It's still nighttime in the game?
Oh, my.
Michelle is fine.
Everyone's fine.
Chat can stop freaking out.
Everyone's fine.
We're almost there.
We're on the home stretch.
It's almost early enough for the zombies to start coming down, too, which is good.
All right, I'm gonna hold of those shotguns.
Who's missing?
Who's missing?
Beth.
Beth with my chainsaw.
Came up with five, right?
Yeah.
One of you get out of the way of the other one.
All right.
Level 40.
All right.
I'll take that.
Feels like I was more leveled, first time, the last time we did this.
At this rate, I'm gonna have everyone but two people saved before we even get to the bomb mission.
Oh, I've got Ronald already, Jack.
I, I, I was worried about it earlier, so I kept asking people to remind me.
And now I think, as a joke, they're stilll reminding me, even though that time in the game has, has come and gone.
Um, where do I wanna go?
Yeah, we'll take a shortcut.
Ronald, Ronald's been fed twice.
He wants to recruit him.
That wasn't the, the time I was paranoid about forgetting.
Because the bad one's the second time in the security room, which is the only time he asks is in the security room.
Done and taken care of.
Haha, yeah!
Wrecked him.
Fucking wrecked him.
All right, no Susan yet.
Definitely doing better than last time.
Last time I didn't really have the...gun store people saved.
All right.
While I'm thinking about it...
Therobroy, TomRamens, and SkSk, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Six months in a row, three months in a row, and twelve months in a row.
Thank you.
All right.
That takes care of that.
Back to the game.
Back to What's Gonna Go Wrong to Ruin My Perfect Run, the stream.
Who was trying to call me?
Oh, someone probably has a request.
Oh, it's probably Kindell.
Oh, god.
That's another one you can't forget, or you're fucked.
No, Gil.
Oh, shit.
Susan.
Bad timing, Susan.
Bad timing.
Susan, what are you doing?
All right.
You stay over here by the nice man with the shotgun.
He'll keep you alive, and I'm gonna get Leroy, and then we're all, we're all gonna leave.
Oh, boy.
Gil and Susan.
This will be difficult.
Good job, granny.
Good job, granny.
All right.
Can't let Susan die.
Can't let that happen.
Come on, granny.
Come on, granny.
Let's go!
Come on.
I need to get in the bathroom, not stand in the entrance.
You need to all be in the bathroom, so we can all go over at once.
That has to happen that way.
All right, you're all in the bathroom.
Oh, boy.
Leroy, I'm gonna trust you with my, with my saw.
I know I have to get another one, anyway.
This is a, this is a joke.
This is a comedy routine.
This is why you don't want to escort two cripples.
All right, Gil.
Ah, heal and level up.
Oh, boy.
Oh, god.
Oh, she's at half health.
I thought she was lower than that.
Not that scary.
Why won't you people use your shotguns.
Fucking, Leroy!
You're giving me that chainsaw back right now.
Debbie, don't get too close.
I'm brandishing a deadly weapon.
A, a deadly, deadly weapon.
A Debbie-killer weapon.
Cuz fucking Leroy hit me with a chainsaw too many times, and now I'm low on health.
See how this works.
All right, all right.
Finally using that shotgun.
All right.
All right.
All right, that's the worst of it.
Susan, you're going the wrong way, Susan.
Fuck, I'm so close.
So close.
So amazingly close.
Oh, wow.
Holy fuckballs.
Holy fuckballs.
You guys wanna dance?
You know what...dance.
Dance.
That's fine.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, wow.
Holy fuck.
I have never done this well before.
Ooh, look at that.
Chat, you may have just saved my ass by reminding me about Kindell.
No?
No option to talk to him.
I think that's good.
I hope it's good.
All right, well, I have to kill time.
I need a new chainsaw, so, I'll get a chainsaw.
The Kindell problem is, Kindell starts a mutiny and takes away a quarter of my survivors.
At some point, he's gonna do it.
Apparently, he hasn't done it yet.
I was sure that's what Otis was trying to call me about.
But it wasn't giving me the option to talk to him, so...
Hopefully that wasn't just a glitch.
Well, I know I didn't answer the phone, but still, I, I still think that mission would, would come up even if I didn't answer the phone.
It would be...I dunno.
I dunno a lot of things.
But I did try to talk to Kindell.
It wasn't letting me.
I'm a little bit worried it's some kind of glitchy thing.
And when I get, a quarter of my survivors are gonna be gone.
I'm a lot, I'm, I'm not, actually, I'm a lot worried about that.
Cuz now, I have no idea what the call was for.
Maybe it was just for Leroy.
Cuz I don't ever remember getting a call for Leroy when I saved.
So maybe everything's good.
Maybe, hopefully.
I'm not sure entirely everything's good.
Gonna make some quickstep.
I, I have no healing items.
Yes, it's the third day.
And I actually have a lot of the pain in the ass type of stuff taken care of.
This is going too well.
It's frightening.
All right.
Off to the security room.
That's a lot of real estate.
Probably should've done a quickstep.
Better safe than sorry.
Yes, yes, chat.
This game again.
It's not like I didn't say I was going to try another no-death run on a non-normal streaming night.
All right, all right.
I have plenty of time.
But I do wanna make sure I beat Kent.
Yeah, I plan on checking Kindell again, even though I didn't get a call.
WordSavage says Kindell is still an hour away.
I'm gonna double-check anyway.
I'm, I'm so close to rescuing everybody.
I'm not gonna risk losing a quarter of them now.
All right.
All's cool with Kindell, for  now.
Gotta get there before the cutscene.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
All right.
I'm in time.
Oh, didn't mean to drink that.
Oh, well.
Did my flipkick.
Douche is dead.
You're glad the protagonist is ugly.
I am, too.
Frank is interesting.
What is it, Otis?
Kindell?
All right.
Wow.
Clear sailing.
Jack, thank you for entertaining everybody in the chat.
In chat.
I'm so, so fucking close to pulling this shit off.
What I'm, what I'm worried about is that I'm gonna get to the end and the last boss of the game is gonna kill me.
That's what I'm worried about.
Goodbye, FrostySnooze.
Yes, the final boss of the game is hard.
Also, yes, I have heard of the Dead Rising streaming only on Crackle.
And I started to watch it, and I was enjoying it, but there were so many ads.
Oh, god.
It was like watching network TV again.
Network TV.
I mean, every, every minute of, of movie was accompanied by, like, four minutes of ads.
Made me sick.
Ooh, sorry, Simone.
Trying to do something else.
Where ya at, where ya at?
Come on, come on.
I'm right here.
Definitely don't wanna make that exchange.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Kindell, Kindell, Kindell.
Are you gonna read a book?
No.
That is all of the survivors.
All survivors are now saved.
And they will remain saved so long as I can get this Kindell business taken care of.
Even if I die right now, this is a damn fine run.
I have never pulled this off before.
I am very, I'm, I'm, internal, inside, I'm giddy.
I'm going for the true ending.
Even if...look, if you go for the true ending, you still get over 50 survivors after overtime.
Cuz, uh, you count.
All right.
Wooo, doggy.
Shit just got real.
I am not past the part where we crashed last time.
Why do I have Face Crusher?
My life is complete.
Oh, I should've grabbed a skateboard.
Fuck it.
By the time I go back for the skateboard, eh...it's fine, it's fine.
Do I dabble in the realm of liquor, or am I a strict beer man?
Actually, I am a teetotaler.
I have nothing against drinking or people who drink.
I just don't, myself.
Always been uncomfortable with, uh, anything that would alter my, my perceptions.
Anything that's gonna fuck with my brain.
It's ehh.
Brain barely works as it is.
I should've grabbed the skateboard.
I still have time.
Do I drink coffee?
No, but it has nothing to do with caffeine.
I just don't like coffee.
Doesn't matter how much cream and sugar you put into it.
Coffee always tastes bitter to me.
All right.
This is the, uh, home stretch here.
No, my fiancee is not also a teetotaler.
She's a, she's a social drinker.
The one time I did drink, it was because, uh, she was so curious about what I would be like drunk.
Nothing especially exciting happened.
It's not really like a story worth telling, but...
Oh, fuck.
Well, that sucks.
There was one down in here, I think?
I should not be falling down now.
Ugh, you fucking zombie!
If he blows up my bike, I'm gonna be so pissed off.
Eh, we lost a bike.
That's all right.
We'll be fine.
We'll be fine.
Lost some time.
I'm not happy about that.
Where's the next one?
Where's the fucking next one?
Yeah, I know what I gotta do.
Oh, boy.
This car is gonna give out.
This car is gonna give out.
Hell, yeah, I'm getting the extra Brad cutscene.
Yes, person using PreviouslyRecordedLive right now is Jack.
You wanna know what happened to Brad?
You'll, you'll find out in just a second.
I'm driving to his location right now.
Oh, shit.
Ugh...
Well, Xbox took another shit.
God, these things are awful.
Redo the fucking bombs is what that fucking means.
I'm not gonna count that because that's a fucking, that's a fucking technical glitch.
It has nothing to do with me failing.
Sours my run.
God, that's annoying.
Who am I logged in as?
Oh, I gotta...
God, that is so obnoxious.
I know I saved after Kindell, but I'm not taking chances.
All right.
Motherfucker.
Piece of shit system.
Piece of fucking shit is what you are.
Fuck it
Fuck it.
Just a little bit, kinda sours the, the Dead Rising run of my life.
It wasn't really a no-death run.
It kind of reloaded, I mean...
Fuck off.
Fucking piece of shit hardware.
Piece of shit, lousy, third-rate hardware.
I wouldn't have an Xbox if it weren't for this game.
It's the only reason I haven't thrown the fucking system in the trash.
PlayStation 3, I bought it early on in the PlayStation's life, and it was used.
Never failed me.
Never fucking failed me.
Xbox?
Fuck.
Fuck.
I'm, I'm, I'm the red ringmaster.
I'm the ringleader.
The red ringleader.
God, that pisses me off.
This game needs a, a fucking PC release.
It just needs it.
Every other good game is available on another system.
I'll, I'll utter more words.
Right now, I'm, I'm focused on, on getting back to where I was before the fucking Xbox took a goddamn shit.
How come the Xbox gets a potty break, but I don't?
Turn...no?
Oh, there it is.
Fuck you, Carlito.
Yes, this is the quiet of cold fury.
Here.
ScribeFractions, if you're waiting for me to chant jimmy jams, I, I would not hold my breath.
That's Jack thing.
To me, the jim, whole jimmy jams business, that's just weird.

[Part III]
Striker1121, um, just collect your money now.
I am not skipping the cutscene.
Oh, that's right.
I did chant jimmy jams during the Dark Souls thing.
Eh, I'm fine.
I don't need to.
Besides, chanting jimmy jams is not going to help my goddamn Xbox.
Fucking piece of shit Xbox.
Wizardgee, Xbox, they, they're not very sensitive to feelings.
They're insenstive.
This is why they, they crash near the ends of highly successful no-death runs.
Xbox's don't give no shits.
Xbox is, like, fuck you, I'm gonna red ring.
Fuck you.
Oh, how much you pay for me?
Oh, too bad.
You got ringed, bitch.
That's, that's an Xbox.
They're highly insensitive.
I'm gonna say, it feels like we're back from this cutscene.
I wanna get the, the, the key to the underground that's in this room back here.
So I do have reason to come over here.
If, if you're waiting around to see if I'm gonna pull off the run, and you wanna be doing something else, it's gonna be a little while.
We got some, we got some hours left to go.
I, I fully understand if it's getting late and you wanna leave.
We're gonna be around probably till 2 A.M.
Jack, this is my Xbox.
I know you wanna make videos smashing into freezes again, but I'm gonna want another Xbox if we do that.
It's the only way I can play this game.
Dead Rising is why I put up with 360.
All right.
I'm gonna take care of some business while this is running.
Actually, there's only one new one.
Okay.
Secksweirdo, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
How come Dead Rising 1 hasn't gotten a port when the others have?
I've heard, and I don't know if it's true because I've heard, I've heard the opposite, too, conflicting reports that the engine they use for Dead Rising 1 was some kind of weird, weird Japanese engine that was difficult to port, uh, stuff over to Windows on.
That's what I've heard.
I've also heard people say, oh,  that's not true.
So I don't, I don't know.
I don't know.
Oop.
Fuck.
There's my car.
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.
Fuck.
Yeah, that's where I wanna go.
I wanna turn around.
Go exactly the opposite way.
You can stop feeling I didn't save.
I'm going to, I'm actually headed to the saving...excuse me, the saving place.
For saves.
Let's save, let's save in the bathroom.
I, I do have to go to Betty.
FlushyPatch, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right, I'm gonna make some quickstep and then, by then, it oughta be about time to, uh, start the final leg of, uh, 72-hour mode here.
Won't do that anymore.
Also, that won't do anymore either.
Inventory just got a lot lighter.
Wrong button.
Dammit.
There we go.
I've never done that before!
All right, come on, get back to yonder safe house.
Dammit.
Holy, there are a fuck ton of zombies.
Yes, we have talked about Mad Max already.
It's fucking awesome.
The conclusion we all came to was, you need to stop what you're doing and watch Mad Max immediately, if not sooner.
Preferably sooner, because that movie needs to make money, so they make more kickass, brutal, R-rated action movies with practical effects.
Uh, VGDennis, you could argue that you're late, or you could argue that you're right back to where we were when the last one glitched out on me.
MrParasaur, you said it should've been called Mad Furiosa.
You are completely wrong.
Completely wrong.
Comically wrong.
It's, it, he has exactly as much screen time as he had in The Road Warrior.
I mean, he's, he, yeah, no, you're wrong.
You know what?
Paul can fucking wait.
Hurry up, Izzy.
Trying to stop fucking up myself here, but hurry up.
Fuck.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I don't need no weapons.
I'm Frank West.
I need to head soon, though.
Let's get outside, first.
Why are you running through the area that has the thickest amount of zombies, Izzy?
It's kind of stupid.
They won't all need to die.
Come on.
Come on.
FlushyPatch, I, I know it took five years, but I'm, I'm glad you're on board with me now.
Isabela is hot.
Stupid, fucking...ehh...meh, see, meh?!
I ate.
I ate.
I'm glad those fucking convicts are dead.
Oh, whoa.
Where the fuck were you?
Holy fuckballs, there are a lot of zombies.
There are so many zombies, and it's so fucking dark.
I can't see shit.
I'm gonna use my thord.
Call about Cheryl yet?
Because that's the last one.
Chat, what time does, uh, the, the, the photograph side mission start?
I'm gonna wait around a little bit for the call.
Since I'm so close to being absolutely perfect.
So close.
I'm gonna save!
I'm gonna save as soon as I get the call for this.
I don't wanna go back in there, save, come back out, get the call from Cheryl, and then have to go back in.
We're doing all of this at once.
You can't sa-, you have to be, you have to be at a save spot.
All right.
I'm gonna get the butcher.
Don't worry.
I have to do this first.
Cuz after the butcher, I can't do any of this.
And after I do this, I will have saved all of the survivors, and done all other side quests.
Which is fucking awesome.
Hey, this is, this is the side quest.
After this, all the side quests, uh, done.
And if she's gonna pose, I may as well get the free presitge points.
I love how everybody else in the room went to back away.
All right.
We're off to finish the game.
We'll be fine.
Oh, I forgot to save.
Oh, well.
No time now.
No time now.
We're racing the clock.
Racing the clock.
Holy shit, I beat the, the, I made it to the bathroom before the, the bathroom could load.
Wait a mintute.
I'm missing something here.
Where is the, where is the door?
It's gotta be down here.
There it is.
It's not great.
I may have time to get another chainsaw, though, so we're gonna deal with it.
All right.
All right.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Technically, Frank's been here three days.
But, the zombie outbreak's been going on for longer than that.
It was going on before Frank West shows up at the mall.
You want me to give your friend a shoutout?
Sure.
Hey, Colonel.
You're cool, bro.
Ow.
Ow.
Yes, I know, I know the mini chainsaws are overpowered.
I feel cheap using them, but it's all for the sake of doing a no-death run.
Americans are fat.
Did you know Americans are fat?
All right, is there anything to eat in here?
I'm not doing terrible on health, but better safe than sorry.
All right.
All right.
Time for fucking around.
Technically, there isn't.
Earlier we get on this shit, the better.
What?
Oh, whoops.
I did not want to do that.
Not really.
Just gonna wait this one out.
So, I don't know how to feel about that fucking Xbox freeze bullshit.
It's soiled my no-death run.
It took my no-death run, and my Xbox pulled down its pants, and pissed all over it.
I know there are points to be had, but I'm gonna have plenty of time to kill after the next couple missions.
Plenty of time to kill.
We'll be fine.
Can I save in here?
I can.
So you're saying, unless I die in-game and the system crashes, it's still a no-death run, but you have failed to do is a single segment no-death run.
Yeah, I know.
It would feel so much better if it were a single segment.
But it still feels good.
This is my best Dead Rising run ever.
Which is why I'm gonna die in the end.
The very end.
I know it.
Ah, yes, the game froze a while back.
I've been saving this time, though.
So, we started nearby.
It froze right before, right after finishing the, the bomb run.
You know, now I'm worried it's going to freeze while I'm saving, and ruin the save.
All right, I have never even played Dead Rising 3.
Now, recently, very recently, one of you guys very generously, uh, gifted me a copy of Dead Rising 3.
I haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
I kinda wanna play through the whole series, so after this, I dunno, I dunno if I'm gonna stream it.
If I do stream it, it won't be a no-death run.
I, then I'm gonna play through Dead Rising 2, and then, uh...shit...then, uh, I'll get around to 3.
I'm going the right way, aren't I?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hate this corridor.
Dead Rising 2 will not be Sunday.
I got other plans with Jack.
I know, I know regular Dead Rising 2 is, is the canon Dead Rising 2, but Off the Record has Frank West.
So, there's that.
I'm not sure which one I'll play though.
I, I have both.
Do I want canon, or do I want Frank West?
Probably Frank West, but I'm not convinced yet.
Not 100%.
TinyTurnip, have a, have a nice nap.
Sleep well.
Thank you for showing up.
Anybody else feel like taking a nap?
We've, we've got a chunk of game left, so if you wanna go, now's as good a time as any.
I completely understand.
Grab one of those flashlights.
It's dark.
Comically, comically dark.
All right, Jack.
Good night.
Thanks for, thanks for chatting with everybody.
Making the silent, nearly silent stream a bit more exciting.
We're, we're damn near at the end of it, of, of story stuff.
Now it's Jessie.
It's kinda tragic.
Jessie and Brad are the reason you can't save everybody with the, uh, true ending card they give you.
Ending A, whatever they wanna call it.
Did she ever get bitten?
It's possible, uh, Barnaby did something.
I don't think you even necessarily have to get bit in this universe.
I, I'm assuming, like, a wasp sting might do it.
Yeah, there is a way to save Jessie and Brad.
You just can't get the good ending.
You have to get one of the lesser endings.
You st-, basically, stop the story before they die in the story.
So, Otis, Otis abandoned his end of the mall.
Fucking Otis.
And, uh, he took everyone else with him.
Hi, Jess.
Oop, fucked that up.
So, now, uh, we're on our own for a while.
What, uh, what time does the next thing happen?
All right.
It actually doesn't say.
All right.
Well, technically, I'm, I'm done, but I know there's one more thing I, I can do, and I need to do, to get the ultimate good true whatever final bestest amazing amaze-mo wonderment ending.
But, uh, yeah, we got, we got time to fuck around here.
Actually, I'm gonna, while I'm in this safe room, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna let this run for a bit.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Okay.
I am back.
So, how we doing?
That is a nice thord.
That's the thord I got for killing the cult guy.
It's still, still lasted.
It's a good thord.
All right.
Let's go, let's go play around in this mall.
Technically, I could, I could just hang out in the safe room for twelve hours gametime and, uh, accomplish most of my goals.
But we're not gonna do that.
That's not fun.
We're gonna, we're gonna play around in this zombie funhouse.
Save?
Uh, yeah.
That's a good point.
I'll save.
We could, we could track down stickers, take pictures of, uh, stuff.
It, it would be hilariously tragic if I died while fucking around, but...do you want, do you want the rest of this stream to be just this?
Sitting here like this?
No, we're doing something.
Yeah, I'm, I'm definitely, first thing I'm doing is we're going to the orange juice store, and we're gonna make some health.
Uh, I'm going to try to get to level 50.
I don't know if that's possible.
Like, mathetmatically, I'm not sure if I can.
But, uh, we'll, I'll, I'll do my best.
Actually, waiting around in this room while I went to the bathroom, probably didn't help the cause, but whatever.
Fuck it.
Did I show you guys the showerhead?
Showerhead's great.
Actually, you know what, taking the elevator down might not be quicker.
I might have goofed there.
But, no big deal.
No big deal.
We, we've managed to do everything, so it didn't hurt me any.
What?
What's this?
Why, what's going on?
What could this be?
All right, now those guys, they're gonna be how I attempt to level up.
You get something, like, 5,000, uh, Prestige Points a kill.
So if I'm gonna do it...shit...it's gonna be by killing special forces assholes.
I'm gonna try not to die.
Oh, fuck.
Five of them?
All right, we're just running.
That's greater numbers than I can handle.
Not with a, not with a dying chainsaw.
Don't need that shit anymore.
All right.
Let's find some special forces assholes.
Fucking die.
Well, we're almost leveled.
We'll get to 47...
Let's make our way to the chainsaw.
Chainsaw will be a lot of help.
Cheap, but we're in no-die mode.
Nice.
Ooh, Attack Up.
That's a good one.
What are my, what are my stats?
Life, throw distance...gotta get that throw distance!
Sorry.
That was silly.
You fucking zombie.
OP chainsaw.
Oscar Percival Chainsaw.
That's, that's its name.
OP.
All right.
Need some more guys to kill.
Right down there.
Eh, food court.
How was Dead Rising 2 and 3?
Two is okay.
It's so much easier, I don't enjoy it as much.
Uh, three, people say it's bad.
I haven't played it.
It's recently been...
I know there's a...oh, that's just...
Oh, fuck you.
That guy liked food court much.
Um, I just had a thought I was gonna do something, and I forgot what I was gonna do.
Something I wanted to get that would help make things...easier?
God.
What was I gonna do?
Was I gonna get a book?
I clean forgot.
Oh, I remember what I was gonna get now.
I was gonna get...
Oh, fuck.
I forgot about that.
We're, we're taking the long way.
We're not fucking with that shit.
A large open space, then I get close to fight here.
Moving on.
All right.
Avoid the park.
There we go.
That helps.
That helps a lot.
All right.
So, so, that's our life now.
We're, we're killing special forces guys, and, uh, killing special forces guys.
I should probably get rid of my thord.
It's of limited usefulness now.
Certainly will
Still not able to, that's amazing.
Don't make 'em like they used to.
I could sword the SWAT guys, but they're dangerous.
I'm not fucking around with SWAT guys.
There's gotta be some SWAT motherfuckers here somewhere.
There's no way there aren't.
Are there no SWAT to murder?
I mean, what the fuck?
Here we go.
Got two.
There's one more down here.
It's gonna be dangerous.
Oh, there we go.
Right to my side.
Be careful.
Where are...some of the blenders?
Maybe it's something for using all of the blood...
Where is SWAT?
Where is SWAT?
Goddammit.
It's corner of...
This is as far as SWAT goes.
Fuck.
Flying around.
Flying around.
Uh, there are PP logos on everything now because I grabbed the book that let's you see what genre something is.
Like, if there's horror going on, the PP logo will flare up over it.
Uh, when I wanna grab some queens later, uh, it'll help find those a lot easier because the queens will show up, uh, as a green PP logo.
The queen zombies.
Oop, that's not what I wanted.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.ffff
Oh, I keep hearing a gunshot echo.
I think there are special forces in the distance.
It's, it's from the, uh, the sound playing through the stream.
Did I miss somebody?
Nope.
Nope, I didn't.
While I'm here, I'm gonna grab my orange juice.
Almost at 48.
Maybe I can do, uh, level 50.
That would be fucking awesome.
Stream's still streaming okay
All right.
Good, good.
No cover mechanic?
No cover mechanic.
To be fair, 90% of the game is a zombie game.
That would be kind of silly.
Fucking die.
Ah, there's a blender.
Let's get closer to...
Nice.
I had, I had this machete in my inventory ever since, uh, the hatchet man scoop.
All right.
Where are you special forces jackasses?
Oop.
Didn't do exactly what I thought I was gonna do there.
Dare I say, that's more efficient than shooting them.
Oh, you're right there.
Now you're not.
I think there's a blender in the supermarket`, so I'm gonna head that way.
Fuckers.
Fuckers.
Ba-boom.
All right.
Did not forget to save.
Good call.
Good call, LardSavick.
I'm sure other people have said it, too.
Into the supermarket.
Oh, no.
I'm not going for the 52,000 zombie achievement.
I, I don't even have time to now, anyway.
I am trying to get to level 50 before the game ends.
Because that would be awesome.
I know it's around here somewhere.
Here we go.
Almost had a machete.
Kind of sad.
See what's over here.
Well, that didn't make any sense.
Uh, maybe there is a blender in here.
There's not a blender in here.
Where are other blender I'm forgetting about?
One in the movie theater.
This is not a big deal.
I believe it's 10,000 points.
That's only two special forces kills, so not a big deal.
No reason not to eat.
Oh, is there two blenders in the movie theater?
All right.
Well, then we're going back to the movie theater.
Nice to have goals.
Time I have?
All right.
As long as I go see Isabela by 10AM, we're golden.
Oh, it's gone.
Farewell, my friend.
Thord work as well?
Eh, it worked okay.
A little bit slower.
Fuck.
Better get some orange juice before anything else.
Cuz a dead Frank is a bad Frank.
And, uh, we'll bring a pie to the blender.
Why not?
A pie.
Hot damn.
I might actually make it to level 50 in one run.
That's, that's fucking awesome.
You notice I'm talking a bit more now that there's, there's less, uh, stress.
Less concentration.
All right.
Where's the other one in the theater?
All right, that's the one I used...oh!
Right next to it.
Motherfucker.
Pie, and, uh, chips.
We'll get pie and chips.
Zombie.
Well, that's the last thing I need right now.
All right.
I'm assuming there's one in the food court I've missed then.
So now I'm over my way towards the food court.
Fuck fuck fuck.
Level up!
Life?
All right!
All right!
There is probably a blender in the food court I missed.
I'll get a paltry 10,000 points.
Actually, the last upgrade, unless you get two for the last one, is the zombie one.
This sword is fucking great.
It's made of admintium.
Adamintium.
Whatever.
Die.
Fucking die.
Do not wanna die this close to the end.
Coffee shop and Al Fresca.
All right.
We'll hit that level two.
Fuck.
Die.
Some ovens I missed?
Add up all the weapons.
Laser sword stopped working.
Fuck that.
Oh, fuck off.
That's gotta be all of them in this area, right?
That was just an insane number of special forces dudes.
Pretty sure I used that blender once, but I'm not 100%.
Raw meat.
Mmm, raw meat.
And, what do we got?
Cooking oil!
Raw meat and cooking oil.
Yum.
Zom...Zombait.
Any use for that anymore.
All right.
I know I used that blender a fuckton.
Yeah.
All right.
So we gotta find this blender in Al Fresa Plaza.
I think we used this oven, but I'm gonna make sure.
Nope, it's not.
Yeah, I've used it.
All right.
That last blender.
That sword is a trooper.
A real American hero.
How long till the helicopter?
I should get a phone alert two hours before.
All right.
Oh, this plaza is death.
Fortunately, the zombies are fucking with the special forces guys.
Sword's not...I'll drop that.
Obviously.
Go back and get uncooked pizza.
Use that last oven.
See if we can get a special bonus for that.
Thord almost dead.
Fuck you.
Live dangerously.
Fuck.
Pizza and, uh, yogurt.
Zombait?
No, I don't want Zombait.
What time we got?
All right.
All right.
Gonna hit up that last oven, and then that's it.
This is fun.
Get 'em, zombies!
Get 'em!
All right.
Not bad at all.
Sword keeps on rocking.
Love me some big chainsaw.
I think, I think I'm guaranteed 40 at this point.
I'm pretty sure I get points after the story is over, which should be enough.
Level Max!
We did it!
Fuck you!
This is the most amazing Dead Rising run that has ever happened in the history of ever.
I'll toot my own fucking horn.
This is fucking awesome.
Yeah, now I just have to not die.
Special forces?
I knew I'd run into you guys.
Die!
Oh, fun's over
Chainsaw died.
Sword's still kicking.
Almost there.
Oh, I didn't make it.
Noble effort, though.
Fuck you, zombie.
Yeah!
Something I'm missing over here.
Something I wanna grab.
There it is.
Never got to show you guys this thing.
All right.
Doesn't work on special forces guys, which I guess is not a shock.
But...watch this, watch this!
Almost there.
We're almost there.
Bam!
I'm gonna save.I'm gonna save.
Like, even if I don't get to the helicopter, I'll get an ending, and, and technically, it will have been a no-death run.
So, phlbttth.
Uh, yeah, for people asking, I made a, a new profile.
Which was a good thing I did because we did have another Xbox freeze issue, cuz the Xbox is a decrepit piece of shit.
Yes, SWAT killed all of the zombies.
So now I have nothing to do but get to the helicopter.
Tried to take Isabela with me.
She wouldn't come.
Izzy would have nothing to do with this.
Her loss.
With, uh, more than a little time to spare.
Oh, my god.
Think I'm gonna take another bathroom run.
Oh, wow.
All right.
Did the Xbox melt down?
Almost there.
Less than an in-game hour.
Zombie walk?
Yeah, I think I can manage Zombie walk.
This is what you get for, uh, top, the, the highest level.
Don't, don't spoil things, chat.
Don't spoil things.
I've never played around with the zombie walk, much.
It's kind of amusing.
I, I, I love the look on his face.
Yes, it makes the zombies think you're one of them.
I, it's mostly an easter egg.
Cuz really, it's kind of completely useless.
Cuz if you're rescuing people, you can't walk this slow.
Plus the zombies would attack me, survivors who aren't you, anyway.
But it's fun.
This game is all about having fun.
Am I going to watch the Hawks tomorrow?
I'm probably gonna be here streaming.
If they, if they get to the Stanley Cup Finals, I'll make sure I watch those games.
But we'll see.
Yeah, there we go.
Enjoy it, people.
Oh, the game's out at two?
That's werird.
Now, I'm sure everyone has figured out what overtime mode is by now.
But if there were an overtime mode, would not that have been the fucking perfect ending to a zombie movie?
I mean, just absolutely perfect?
And I'm totally doing overtime mode.
I'm, I'm happy enough with the way this game went tonight, even if I'm not successful at overtime.
I got, I did get an ending, and I didn't die.
So, good!
You don't, don't agree that's a perfect zombie movie ending?
I, I think, the classic Romero zombie movies are horribly depressing.
I mean, first one ends with, uh, what's-his-face getting shot by the people, by the human beings.
The second one ends with him taking off in a helicopter that's almost out of fuel, and they have no idea what the fuck they're going to do.
Classically, zombie movies have dark endings.
Anybody who wants to leave now, we can, we can officially say I've done a no-death run.
So, no, no shame in leaving now.
But I'm, I'm gonna keep playing until I get to the end-end, or die.
Possibly die.
Yeah, Kosper, the original ending to Dawn of the Dead, they fucking killed themselves.
OnBrunch says it's a good ending, but not a good ending.
There's more.
There's more.
How long is overtime mode?
Overtime mode can bare-, uh, can vary.
There, there's still a timer, but you can finish overtime mode before the timer.
Actually, you need to.
If you don't finish overtime mode before the time runs, you die.
So, overtime mode is a, is as long as it takes me to finish overtime mode.
Look at that.
Look at that.
This is great.
Fucking great.
Uh, HellCopter, there are over 50 survivors, but by completing story mode, some characters die.
Good night, JohnKilo.
Or if you're saying good night to somebody else, good night to that person.
I, I have my reason for not saving there.
I will be safe.
For everyone who is wondering why Frank didn't get infected, he is.
All right.
Here we go.
All right.
You guys want a picture?
All right.
What do all I need to get, and where is it?
OzMike, I think, I think it would be relatively safe to get food.
Unless you're going out to get food.
All right.
There's stuff over here I need?
Development fluid, or something.
Might be in the other photo place.
Oh, well.
Oh, well.
It's fine.
First-aid kit.
You guys are gonna get fucking chainsawed.
Know what, you know what, fuck the machine gun.
Chainsaw, better than machine gun.
Milk or orange juice?
Why isn't the arrow active?
There we go.
There we go.
Problem solved.
Apparently, it's under me.
No big deal.
All right.
What else?
Yay, I got an achievement.
Shut up.
Wait.
Probably smart to sec-, set my next objective first.
There we go.
Got to it before the beeps.
Of course I'm fighting back.
It's getting late.
Those queens are the bee, in the little jar, that destroy whole groups of zombies.
The zombies in this game are the result of parasitic wasps.
What do you know, I can stealth them.
Oh.
He's right in front of me.
Gotta be careful of that chainsaw.
It's not gonna last forever.
Shit.
Can't open in overtime mode.
Okay.
All right.
So we gotta get there the hard way.
Gotta go around.
No big deal.
For what it's worth, I'm getting tired, too.
I'm gonna see this through, though.
Shit.
Shut up.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Whoo, boy!
I want blood now.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
It's okay.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.
Oh, it's okay.
Everyone's fine.
We're fine.
Oh, I accidentally got rid of my quickstep.
Eh, that's okay.
I don't need quickstep anymore.
Jesus fuck.
I, I just about shat myself.
Damn near shat myself.
I don't wanna do that again.
Fucking die.
In groups, they're dangerous.
All right.
Think all I need now are the queens.
Yep.
Fuck.
Fucking hell.
I'm saving.
I'm saving.
Oh.
One health.
Well, that's something.
It's something.
Die, die, die, die!
Which route to Izzy?
Need some more juice.
I fucking hate you guys.
Oh, not enough room for it.
And I'm not giving up any of that other stuff, so off we go.
Find the stairs.
I am really getting fatigued.
Oh, fuck.
Good night, everybody who needs to go to sleep.
Let's grab 'em all.
Let's juice.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Special forces guys are officialy scaring me now.
We're getting close.
There's gonna be some queen boobery.
Oh, god.
Is my Xbox gonna freak out?
We may actually red ring before this is over.
All right.
Oh, that's right.
I gotta get the generator.
All right.
Home stretch, home stretch.
I just know at the worst possible moment my chainsaw is gonna give out.
I just knows it.
In my blood.
Good night, Krieger.
Good night, anybody.
Nobody is obligated to stay.
I know this is a long-ass stream.
So a no-, no-death run is, is longer than I even thought it would be.
Here's the...helicopter crash.
Oh, anybody can stay.
I'm just saying, you don't have to feel obligated.
No, I, I will not be in the Half in the Bag, uh, Mad Max review.
My view, though: go see it.
Mad Max is fucking awesome.
Oh.
Don't forget the generator.
Went through all this for it, and forget the generator.
That would suck.
I hate that helicopter.
The zombie walk won't help me with the helicopter coming.
Plus, I've gotta get a bunch of queens and get all this shit back to Isabela.
Before time is up.
I am stockpiling queens because Isabela's gonna need them to make the cure, or the, not the cure, but the, what do you call it?
I's not even a vaccination, either.
The delay.
She's gonna need it to make the delay.
The suppressant.
All right.
Halfway there with the queens.
Oop.
Not the zombies I'm looking for.
Here you are.
One.
This isn't worth my wait.
Let's see...Wonderland Plaza.
I might grab another chainsaw.
Oh, fuckers.
Four more.
Nope.
That's not a queen.
Where are the fucking queens when you need one?
Nope, nope, nope.
There we go.
Three more.
Fuckers.
Zombait now, that's not useful.
Two more.
The Zombait, the reason I'm throwing that away is that attracts zombies to you.
It's useful when you're escorting survivors, less so any other time.
Looking for the queens.
Fuck off.
Goodbye, flashlight.
Ooh, milk.
Goodbye, milk.
There's still one more.
Aw, yeah!
Damn near there.
Just in case this triggers a cutscene, I'm gonna go grab some weapons.
In case this triggers something I can't come back from
I don't think it will, but...
I'm Frank West, I don't need any damn weapons.
Uh, yeah.
We're good.
We're good.
We're, we're almost there.
Almost there.
Yeah, I'm, I'm at the studio.
My, my home internet sucks.
As far as the, the last boss, I have a strategy I'm going to try.
I don't know that it's going to work.
Quickstep and mini chainsaw.
Yeah, that won't work.
You have to fight the last boss barehanded.
They take away your inventory.
No weapons.
No chainsaw.
No food items.
It's gonna be fun!
Yeah, we're, we're on the last, we're on, this is the stretch.
This is the home fucking stretch here.
Yeah, it's a cool fistfight, if you don't lose.
Isabela, come on.
You fucking, fucking piece of shit Xbox.
All right.
All right.
Almost.
Almost.
It wasn't a red ring.
It just froze.
All right.
Where did I fucking save?
All right.
I just gotta grab some weapons.
I do have that last queen, though.
We don't have to run around for queens.
Yeah, if it freezes just after I beat the final fight, I will call it.
Fucking piece of shit.
Take a knife.
I hate you fuckers.
Probably wine in here.
I'll take coffee creamer.
I'll, I'll accept merch.
Ooh.
I need health.
Health good, health good.
Yeah, we won't need you anymore.
I'll take your knife.
If I die before I get back, does it count?
Uh, yes, because I'm anal.
I'm anal enough that I would say that counts.
All right.
Fortunately, we basically are back to where I was.
How do I like Dead Rising in comparison to the second?
I like the first one more.
I like the tighter time limits.
I, I like the tension because it's more difficult.
I like the fact that it's more difficult to escort survivors.
I feel the, the second one's a little bit watered down in the difficulty department.
Still fun.
There's still some fun stuff.
Certainly the combo weapons are fun.
But, um, yeah, I, I, I like the difficulty in the first one, and I like the protagonist a lot more.
I think Chuck Greene, he's the protagonist in Dead Rising 2, is kind of, kind of boring.
His personality is, he, he has a daughter.
He cares about his daughter.
They took the cheap and easy route, rather than making him a fun person that you want to root for.
I mean, you still root for him because he's got a daughter, but he's not a fun character himself.
Stonewall89 says, yeah, but honestly, Rich, is it really watered-down difficulty if just they fixed the stupid AI and made the AI half-competent?
That is what makes the difficulty watered down.
There, you might not even bother escorting survivors.
They, they just run back to the, they run right back through all the zombies.
They, they, you never really have to tend to them.
They can handle themselves.
They just run back to the safe house.
They follow you perfectly, and you don't have to worry about it.
For the most part.
There's no challenge to rescuing people in, in Dead Rising 2.
Not skipping the cutscenes.
We've been over this with me.
Captain Illogical.
Goodnight, JimmyJam5.
Okay.
SteampunkGirl, and BlickSputtedZebra, black spotted zebra, I'm assuming...thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
I have not played Dead Rising 3 yet.
Somebody gifted it to me recently.
It was very generous.
Looking forward to getting to it, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
Isabela, don't let go of my hand.
Why are you so difficult?
Fuck it.
These tunnels don't make any kind of fucking sense, do they?
And it's under a mall.
What the fuck is...they built the mall on ancient Greek ruins?
They built the mall on top of the aquaducts?
This is insane.
Always be holding hands.
Aughh!
All right.
Yes!
I'll give Dead Rising 2 this much.
I think Dead Rising 2 has a, a better overtime mode.
Not by much.
I mean, it's the same basic thing where you have to do a fetch quest, and then things happen.
But the things that happen are more interesting.
Yes, I have played the Dead Rising 2, uh, Xbox arcade sequel, or prequel to Dead Rising 2, whatever you wanna call it.
Uh, it's neat.
I don't have much more to say about it, but, ehh, it's neat.
Izzy get over here.
All right.
It all ends here.
One way, or the other.
Oh, I hate controller aiming.
Who said this was the last boss?
Hate controller aiming so much.
My controller is like, like those nightmares where you're trying to run, but you're just, like, stuck in quicksand.
And, here we go.
See how long this spitfire holds up.
I know I'm cheesing it.
I don't care.
I'm almost there.
Almost there!
I spit him to death!
Yes!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Sorry for your ears.
Cover your ears.
Whoo!
Fuck yeah!
I fucking spit the last boss of Dead Rising to death.
Wrecked.
Fuck yeah.
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Fucking perfect Dead Rising run.
Fucking perfect.
Everyone saved.
Every fucking side quest accomplished.
The best ending.
No death.
Fuck yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
KrinkleCrunch, thank you for subscribing. I really appreciate it.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
All right.
I'm gonna sit through the credits, because I wanna see the little end scene with all my stats.
But I'm in a good mood about that.
That was fucking great.
Fucking great.
Thank you, everybody, for coming out to watch me spit a man to death.
Um, I hope you enjoyed it.
I hope you enjoyed the game, because I wasn't talking that much for a large part of the stream, because I really wanted to pull this off, and I did it, and I feel great about that.
Fucking great.
Fucking awesome.
Fuck yeah.
All right.
Yes.
Yes.
And let alone no death, I've never even had, I've never even had a save everybody run.
I've always had either the coward or someone else on day two.
Fucking awesome.
Fucking awesome.
If you stuck around for eleven hours, thank you, thank you very much, uh, is it Gagao?
I, I, I hope you got something out of it.
Yes.
Yes.
I am happy.
I'm in a good mood.
This is worth it.
I'm about to lose my voice.
Gonna lose my fucking voice.
I don't care.
I'm gonna, one more time.
Cover your ears.
All right.
It's a warning.
Cover your ears.
Whoo-hoo!
Yeeeeha!
Whoo.
I am tired.
But also wired.
I don't know what I am.
I'm giddy.
I think I'm giddy.
That is great.
Fucking great.
God, they gotta release this on PC.
Cuz this Xbox, fuck this Xbox.
SharkyKrunk, thank you for subscribing. I really appreciate it.
We really appreciate it.
But Jack's not here.
So right now, it's I'm appreciating it.
But I'm sure Jack would if he were here, so I feel safe saying we really appreciate it.
We really do.
Whoo.
And look.
Achievement unlocked: Saint.
I did pull off Saint, because when you leave at the end of, uh, overtime mode, uh, Frank and Isabela count.
Yes, SpookyDooky.
Literally a perfect Dead Rising run.
No death.
Live.
One sitting.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Hooo.
All right.
I'm gonna wait till the final stats come up, and then I'm gonna end this stream.
But once again, thank you all for showing up.
I appreciate it.
I really do.
I'm glad, I'm glad you wanted to see this.
It's great.
Everything, everything is great right now.
Fucking everything is great.
Everything.
Literally everything.
Oh, it didn't show me the...okay, well, that's fine.
That's fine.
Good night, everybody.
It's been fun.
It's been a lot of fun.
We'll do it again sometime.
Um, I know at some point, I'll stream the entirety of Dead Rising 2.
I don't, I don't think that's gonna be a no-death run, though.
I, I may do a, maybe I'll do it as a perfect run, but I'll, uh, load saves after I die.
But, uh, thank you again for showing up.
It's been fun.
