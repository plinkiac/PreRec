[Part I]
okay fits great
alright come on come on
that is not fit to screen that is
totally not fit to the screen reset
properly if I reset the cropping maybe
then nothing works on you Windows 10 go
home
we're gonna play there of fate
properties properties
let me try stretch image to screen let
me see if it'll actually shrink it to
the screen there we go there we go
you want to try it you owe me to try
wreckage here again I'll try record here
again real quick and hopefully that
won't fuck this all up or it'll just
make this worse I'm not I'm not sure
nope nope black screen
black screen
now
all right back to hand to fade I tried I
tried we're going back the hand of fate
interests no no there it is okay okay
one more for the game
you've passed 13 gates and you come to
my table to play the game of life Sam
I'm not using stream esteem both hand of
fate and Rekha tier I bought off of GOG
I mean second I'll tab over the
appropriate window is that good or is it
too much
how's that
Emily was now perfect all right
I'm saying a mix of a bit too much and
it's perfect now
too loud too loud
alright I'll turn it down a little bit
more
how is
Audio was good don't mess with it it's
good all right all right I'm running
with this I'm gonna get all dual that
how's everyone doing tonight
the game begins one lives and one dies
let us see what you're made of
here's the first member of my court the
jack of dust the lighting hair must fall
before you make challenge me
oh there we go
okay let's Jack in the chat what what's
going on oh the Jag of dust that's what
you're talking about
let the cards fall where they may we
begin yes I want to climb down and
retrieve the weapon I always want to
retrieve the weapon choose from these
options I'll take the sword place oh ok
I've had better nights but I'm not
having a terrible one so a moment to
savor that will make you much more
effective
I was never a fan of illusion or
pretense here I'll make an exception
you can now reflect your opponents
ranged attacks using your shield make
good use of this skill if you wish to
survive fair Mareth I'm not surprised to
find that this encounter remains I did
not see the witch and I have not seen
civil war yet yet I guess doesn't really
matter at this point
I'll take gold
I'm sure you are grateful for that
that's ton of gold or I'll need for this
basically tutorial stage where's Jack
Jack has kids that's where Jack is you
are on the final floor did you know
you're not you're not supposed to leave
young children at home alone unattended
find him did you know that if you defeat
me that's having kids you sounds
horribly early to be absolutely horrible
the angeles's let us see what you're
made of
you can now counter your opponents
attacks hit the counter button when you
see the flashing indicator
easy easy
your eye on the cards that's a safe one
good
Axew a peasant's weapon but effective
nonetheless source finer so it's like a
card game and instead of like some kind
of card kind of bad you have like Batman
combat it's fun I'm explaining things as
you can clearly clearly see you just by
listening to me you can hear I'm just
horrible at explaining what is going on
in this game and what do you do in this
game
but every every card is like an
inventing why you've been killed and I'm
sure most of you have seen must play
this for talk about this game before
push stop I didn't remember did we do a
review on this we may have done a
reaction prereq on this yeah we did we
did
sure the power of a prophet choose your
fate
yeah I'm gonna leave the shop I'm good
on everything you can always review your
cards here that's what correctly an
ambush Rd fair is it
guys get your puzzle easy
fine yet everybody needs to rewatch
blind fury because blind fury is an
amazing film I cannot expect you to get
by without some protection
you have reached my first champion a
good man driven to madness by a wall
that took all from him wife and child
kith and kin from such dark and brittle
iron I forged my tools now we see your
mettle
all right let's get on to the some enemy
attacks do not be blocked so County
actually another context puns much of a
challenging stage is pretty easy
actually I'm kind of pissed offensive
damage
matter breaks it's fine
job
not a very responsive dodgeball are you
Barriss minute is
Jesus that was embarrassing
somebody sent me Zed oeg ever washing
you that's the movie that's apparently
blind fury is ripping off I think I paid
for it so it's not illegal yet we are at
the start of our road you will face
eleven more opponents who will test your
strength your memories are you right too
much turkey that was pathetic you fall
at the first hurdle none reached the
last we have wagered and you have won
you may claim your rewards yet I will
also claim mine as you improve so do I
shall we deal again ah good now you
understand the basics we can begin in
earnest your hero is returned to his
beginning items our decks are reset
welcome to the cabinet home of the
members of my court
time for you to face my undead army meet
the Jack of skulls
yeah so I think there's an event were
basically guaranteed to get a mace
interesting this first time I've
actually played this with the DLC
chance cards are even easier I like that
combo multipliers I reduced s fine
I carry extra equipment
sounds miserable I heard about this one
all-you-can-eat us like your your items
or something like that oh my god
mmm
start with maximum and I start with low
maximum health but increases with each
defeated enemy up to a max of 200
can't wear heavy armor yeah
sorry I'm like completely unfamiliar
with all of these
what do you think what does everyone
think
obviously I don't think I'm up to
hardmode right now based on what
happened with the jack of does there
lion all right I'm gonna playing endless
mode though all right I want to unlock
them dark coins
what am I get rid of
new content awaits you it will be
awarded when you complete your run I
will add my own cards to the deck
how boring life would be without a
little spice
well ambush winding trail and the other
one I forgot what's called they're all
basically the same thing right they're
just kind of an encounter with with
enemies I don't think there's a
significance significant difference with
the rewards I always thought it was best
to avoid the problems of others I see
you have no such concerns
yes let's go
it's a lump of iron on a stick not
terribly subtle
yes I would like that equipped is that
what you're going to do it's the best
weapon I can have right now
oh I see can I not can I not put helmets
on then am I kind of stuck with the lion
mask you know I hate the Thundercats
right you all made me you all made me
pick this so cuz because you know I hate
Thundercats
you trolling me that's what you're doing
you guys you guys well done
running water protects against me lion-o
is like the lamest character in all of
fiction there's a problem there's a
problem when you're rooting for the
villains this token will unlock more
cards if you can defeat this encounter
coin
it's not the coin no it's not
oh dear now we're doing that again
because I want I want my token I want
that token shake consumes food but you
will also heal as you proceed there's a
token in it for you if you win
not the token
damnit
dimmer how much food we're at six given
how rarely one encounters the folk you
are fortunate indeed to meet Mareth
again or perhaps we are merely cycling
around the wheel and dipping into the
same memories time and time again
right that puppy some more attempts at
this river which I'm going to try until
I get that fucking token
how will you cross this time oh well I
don't even have the option now that
sucks fuck me
at downwards if you dare
go down the stairs many have reached
this far further in fact I do not know
if you have what it takes to do better
than they did
there you go
did I have a shield I don't remember
I do hope she'll
I'm sure you're grateful for that
that first moment that glinting weapons
the call-to-action to adventure I don't
really don't really need it but I guess
it's not gonna hurt to have more stuff
hurry up
I'm starting to wonder if you're simply
leaving this card in as a quick way to
get your hands on a shield
we've only bad things can happen I
already have a shield
yeah I forgot to change the name of the
stream oh well fuck it I'll change it
later already did not take my shield so
I'm happy with that
greed if it was not for greed then who
would play at this game a choice select
your desire
alright alright need to kill more dudes
oh yay wrong left arm is got that shield
I didn't write on after all one of my
cars a small benefit not 5x are each
take they have a long deeper towards our
foe good now all you need to do is find
and kill the Jack of skulls and we can
progress win this and claim my token
anything would have the card called
ambush ambush no skeletons for you to
deal with
all right so you guys have me take the
lion path hairs because you're hoping I
would get my ass kicked with a low
health those apples going on
Hey Amer
distinctly average what do you expect me
to say congratulations armor protects
you from damage the best armor of course
there's so much more I think is anything
I need to buy
there's will be the one thing you want
people to remember you by
no no I don't care I don't care what
people remember me but when I'm dead I'm
dead at that point nothing matters
literally nothing matters
a classes company to burn CDs so I may
as well take this shirt artifacts
provide powerful special abilities to
use in combat but it takes time to ready
them
then you know doesn't event were the
priest you need to give him money or you
need to give them food I might have just
enough either way I don't even know if I
have that card unlocked yet Chet likes
the the jungle book I don't turn all the
lies I don't know I the story never did
anything for me it's kind of like Tarzan
but not Tarzan he fights Tiger all right
whatever I don't care but I don't care
about anything I don't like anything I
hate everything cause I'm rich Evans
why are you showing this I don't need to
see a picture of it
have a skeleton's easier just made and
they used to block every now and then or
am I remembering that
I don't need any more crap whoo chains
afraid I'll take excellent way to turn
an injury into an asset ah one of my
food cards well done and good luck to
you so much gold I can use the undead of
all the plays in the game these are the
most dangerous in the world yet in no
natural form a wrongness an error
cheating
surprised I'm not playing XCOM - I
played a ton of XCOM 2 jumps from rifles
actually it wasn't screening those is
streaming right I was gonna play an X
commlite game tonight
well we ever play rocket League again
probably at some point I don't think it
makes for my best streams cuz I am
completely talking about nothing except
for rocket League guys a good shot just
that's all you get you can stream it
coming it now our wager becomes more
interesting will the tools you've earned
suffice to address the challenges I pose
I think and then we all know when I
stream that I'm not good at talking
about things and in general
ooh this is new
what are these coins from
this is all brand new to me is that all
just from using the the lion mantle
thing thingamabob
all right now I have the helpful first
shall we deal again
another round and out game truly begins
a bold woman this one she did not
collapse when the Empire did no she took
up arms organized her people and vowed
that in a country where death had
gathered she would be the one feeling
that's like a cycle in the new cards
oh my god all the stuff all the stuff
all right what do I want here what's
good I have no idea what's good
is there all new cards me I don't know
what the what the gains are what the
benefits are they're really difficult
this game is seriously lacking in
third-person shooting I would I want to
clarify something I know so I've ridden
you know reading some of the comments
and people have been taking it the wrong
way I am NOT saying that every
third-person shooter is a bad game in
that quantum break review because like
vanquish third person shooter what about
one of my favorite games of all time
vanquish what I am saying is that when
you want to make a story focused game or
when when when they make these story
focused games these linear dialogue
heavily scripted story games they just
make a lazy third-person shooter because
they don't give a shit about gameplay
I'm not complaining about third-person
shooters in general I'm complaining
about lazy ass bad third-person shooters
that they build talky-talk picnic story
cry a game around you that's what I'm
talking about I'm sure you know you can
add and remove cards from your deck but
feel free to familiarize yourself first
all right um we're good no no we're good
go back to the go back to the screen
where I do the things
now we play for the car first of my
symbols
I've added some cards to spice up the
game in addition to the pain and gain
tax there are now blessings and curses
choose your steps carefully subject play
the DLC once and he had these dice
things I don't know what they do though
I don't recall priests gods and
generally not gold I have none Dona Eve
I thought no drop with any of it you
fucker
you owe half the food don't do nothing
that huge success come on huge huge
success a success I'll take a success
blessings will remain always active and
are never removed unless and I of course
then you're back where you began as
always
the river a challenge for you and a
token if you succeed
great
yes got my River token
oh the dice share which encounters have
moments of chance ah how is that from
the the whatchamacallit card I took the
whatchamacallit card were you hoping
this was the end another floor awaits
gotta explore everything that's just the
way I roll ooh the land walk lover we
play for a token now
what is it Greg
all right well I got the token for doing
nothing for doing nothing I got a token
but that's fine I got the token I want
all tokens one more step down and we may
see the end of this or another set of
stairs
this game is still only beginning new
rules new tools new abilities we have
far to go as yet
all right goodbye some food this voice
acting Rin forever I like your name
because I think I know that's a
reference to but you say the voice
acting and this is terrible
no no you're wrong the dealer's amazing
I'm sure you a grateful for that
it's better than trudging along a muddy
road certainly it was not great for
getting more encounters shadow agent I
have no idea what happens here again a
token is at stake
take the token it is you're right Lois
that was an easy one
now
a horse is a fine companion
I'm sure you'll leave this one in time
you do not seem to have the temperament
for friends even in the animal kingdom
am i starting with a shield now because
if I am I need to get all of those out
of my fucking deck what happened to the
Japanese lair game is that Jack could
not make it in the night I know you and
for one he has the street he s but the
capture card I do not
and we're gonna do we're going to that
Friday I believe the plan is Friday
we're gonna have a make up stream it
lives in every game and the canyon has
been there from the outset
it's Friday that's when we're free I'm
not free tomorrow I've got something big
going on tomorrow so stream will happen
Friday Oh normal sort skip through so
much good equipment just for the normal
sword oh well fine
you might think the world tomorrow I'm
gonna be busy all night yeah it's even
in the darkness there is light to be
found so no stream or hanging out
tomorrow
well tomorrow was a civil war a Civil
War Reenactment I have to go to
as you plunder happy playing grant for
some reason I don't know why some you
wish you'd left untouched
sure I'll offer to help why not
it was fairly basic card all set done
all right
now we begin to raise the stakes the
arena itself will fight against you
yes maybe I should have taken the card
they gave me the better combat
multipliers
descend ever deeper into the
subterranean pit what term ins if I'm
part of a review for a half of the bang
whether or not Mike thinks I'm a comic
book expert when I haven't been into a
comic book store in 10 years you are
close on her trail and more confident
than I had imagined perhaps you will
play beyond this mark and we will see
your true metal crucible let us take a
token on their foolishness
oh well which one which one do I choose
did they make this game easier overall
with the DLC none of these monster
encounters have been very large I know
and I'm gonna be eating my hat later
just seems weird
yes this is hand of fate
come on bring it bring it
easy
a little gold to give you a taste Howard
that's a fuckload of gold only has
something to spend it on a terrifying
walk to get to the Queen so many
potential places for an assailant to get
the upper hand
it's fine ouch
it's fine
Wow very small arena
that's what he dudes
all right
to equip the current whoo are you
woodsman turned warrior now
whoa armor are you sure that's the right
of both of these things yeah rich so
little stream tonight that's why it
sucks so much this Saturday's free
chemical day that sounds great when I
get me hooks why I have to spend $50 a
month for four comic books I know this
one's not gonna be the worst one so I'll
just take it
yeah whatever
now I don't read the digital comic books
I haven't read comic books in a decade I
know that's hard for some people to
understand because Mike keeps billing me
as the comic book guy
by saying I'm not a comic-book guy I'm
saying I used to be a comic book guy but
I really don't know that you can call me
that now when I'm 10 years out of touch
with the comic book world
to frost Fang like me some frost Fang
of course defense but a valuable one
nonetheless
now what happens if I equip this I guess
I'll find out how does it deal with my
occupation does everything flip out or
is it separate I guess it's separate
which is good
yeah Civil War led directly to one more
day civil war was one of the last things
I read oddly enough
I need anything we're just good if I
gotta buy some food I don't need it I
think I'm near the end
they've got a depressing way to go out
rich probably had something doing why I
went out a treasure chest
what more iconic emblem of success could
we imagine
choose from these options
whoo I will happily wager on the outcome
I do not think you have what it takes
you're on the skull I am NOT a skull Wow
move quickly from here there is little
material gain to be made as pleases you
more gold for you and with it more
problems
oh that's right I get slowed down with
the gold middle of the road in every way
well done well we can take care of that
problem real easy
was I were that Ric Flair was part of
the WWE again now I was not I haven't
haven't paid much attention to wrestling
in a while either he's still willing but
his old age my woo was actually better
than his oh he's an old man what do you
expect Christ he's crazy enough I'm
shocked he's still not is he actually
he's not actually getting in the ring is
he it is he I doubt it but a part of me
wouldn't be too surprised
now I am buying all this food when I'm
right near the end because this
particular stage has a curse where the
more gold I have the slower I move
all right hours
Richard challenge ric flair for the
title of nature boy you know what
Ric Flair still probably kicked my ass
roses turn to Rotten enterprise you may
win this battle and send the Queen to
her rightful end yet what have you
gained in the process this token will
unlock more cards if you can defeat this
encounter in level one fictional
character King Vidya loves it when
fictional characters come on the WWF WWE
and they pretend that they're real I
think the worst offender was when the
WCW had Robocop Robocop showed up to
save sting and everyone was afraid of
Robocop even though it's clearly clearly
a man in a clunky plastic costume
know that towards her use your fucking
fries move and and miss room just miss
her completely when you do that too
we ever hit the target
all right that one much better than the
last boss fight actually the first boss
fight
inevitable I suppose and so often those
who beat ploughshare to sword I'm just
going to die their industry truer it did
he become close she for no one near
dying bravely which is all I expect from
my pawns and players
you've earned the first of the symbols
of my power and passed the first gate
there is no turning back now previously
I was merciful but now I cannot be it is
begun
I crafted each of these cards over the
course of years you have taken them from
me moments
so many tokens now so many tokens it's a
little bit insane
come play again good do you have what it
takes to defeat the rat what'd I say
this is the the best none arkham wait I
can't be part of that cuz I've got like
a little window thing could you ever the
the best game to feature an Arkham like
fighting system that isn't an Arkham
game says I eat donuts um
the fighting system itself no but the
cards and the equipment make it very
interesting
probably the best none arkham Arkham
combat shadow of mordor maybe realms of
humanity and now SWAT amongst your
cities and freakin now everyone hates
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of
the shadows game I'm the only one who
likes that game I thought that was a
pretty neat hybrid between an Arkham
like fighter and a regular combo fighter
cuz a little bit of both there's some
Arkham countering mixed with some
regulation combos Mad Max is far more
satisfying oh I'd have to think about
that
I think I think for the most part all of
these are combat games Phil Phil pretty
much to say for the most part
it probably seems so much easier because
you've played Dark Souls 3 and
blood-borne now but no because they're
entirely different types of combat it's
like comparing cheese to oranges doesn't
work oh no I didn't want to do the
recommended no no no get out of here
with that ship she'll die I start with a
shield now I don't need a shield think
I'm getting armor from now on out here
on out
their weapon in there
because I might accidentally get it yeah
watch her watch I'm gonna put the shield
back in this deck and I'm gonna get the
shield it's gonna happen
you what did you do for one I want all
these tokens that's what I want
damn it
anything here with Anna token I've
already unlocked something that's not a
new car
you married you
don't need you I don't need you don't
need you
you're just a father at this point good
decent equipment from that
I haven't noticed much of a difference
with the chance card event easier but
I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with it I'm
gonna stay with it
I can't read that light blue font but I
think the name is was a pretender rich
Evans voice helps me sleep at night
thank you for the backhanded compliment
rich what do you think was a better show
at its peak it's The Simpsons or
Futurama
The Simpsons The Simpsons at its peak
was fuckin awesome
our Lord both fine shows those
yeah this is obnoxious now god damn it
so much for exploring
where I get I'll take frosting I don't
need a ton of food felides are worth it
Ussuri the root of all troubles well
that's just peachy I should not do this
but I'm going to add stupid you cannot
come to this table with debts
outstanding I've wasted the so much food
on this this opening here Oh God so much
food I'm gonna regret it I know I'm
gonna regret it
useful I've got a decent amount of gold
hopefully hopefully I can find a shop
once more seeking the heart of it all
each of these cards is crafted from your
memories and built from your experience
I created them but only in the abstract
it is the importance you place on them
that makes them real there's a token in
it for you if you win
hey food game card three you'll take it
from what is my cursor what is what am i
working against
okay that's not bad
I like this demon he lies as often as he
tells the truth
do it
are you free
draw three blow again
sometimes form follows function and vice
versa in this case it's called a huge
hammer if you take a guess
win this and claim my token
hey yeah spend all of the way
I'm sure you a grateful for that well I
think of the thief movie announcement I
don't think it'll ever get made is what
I think
roaming so the video game movies have
such a great track record though
honestly what's one of those kind of
things it's hard to judge to actually
see what they're doing some kind of
trailer or screen shot or concept art or
something a leaked script
casting we're making a movie about such
and such it's not much to go on
what brings you to play the game I know
you will not tell me like all the rest
you are silent by saying I didn't like
the Prince of Persia movie it was ok but
I'm not sure if it being sarcastic but
honestly it was ok
well now rabbit trespass upon the rat
men's hunting grounds
plagued by name and delay by Nietzsche
who the rats leave behind a deadly toxic
oh I hate these motors so much
very open the chest see what it contains
I gotta get a coin from but I could get
some good loot here what goes on top
skull was on top so I don't want to pick
this right everything's good just keep
your eye on the skull keep your eye on
the skull was on top anything else other
than that what is good we're good
what are you doing an increasing effect
on taking that sort of magic with
another all you need is a channel for
power and it's simple enough artifacts
to give you powerful abilities to use in
combat
so quick to anger that's what makes them
a mob
really
yeah take half my food I got tongue
I made that a little too powerful I will
have to rebalance that next time
once the rat men begin to creep towards
the edge of the town anger follows
shortly behind
what's going on - what's going on - ha
sword is on top everything's good it's
better than trudging along a muddy road
give us more food yes right they're
greedy bastards fucking mob fucking
greedy mob fuck them
they're bullshit now and exit with a
monster encounter this early in the game
that's why it's weird as what that is
all right
dad admitted him
a little extra help but it is only a
momentary respite hush can you hear the
way his claws scratch the tiles a
challenge for you and a token if you
succeed
fine
your prize got the token that's the
matters nature is the greatest threat
even with the Queen now dispatched be
swift I forgot what the way to get the
token here is a choice select your
desire
yay I got the token yeah they will not
let you pass so easily prepare yourself
what all the tokens three little fuckers
lousy rat men hungry mouths war leaves
nothing else
yes
I got two food
doing some
thinking here yeah I could deal with
that I think
hopefully one of these get me at all but
I think at the very least I can make it
to one of those shops before I die where
I can buy some emergency food

[Part II]
I can buy some emergency food
here is your token right
well done forgive me
again a token is at stake
you know I approached you to paid some
attention
yeah food is crucial for healing
if you travel without food your strength
will not be restored between encounters
you'll also begin to starve it seems
you'll learn that soon enough though
this plague and pestilence and blocks
the bigger penalty for not having food
that I remembered there was only five
yes I am sorry I cannot read tips
tonight Friday I believe they should all
be saved Friday I'll just do a massive
tip reading we're gonna make upstream
well not really make up because I am
streaming tonight but we're doing a
stream on Friday and it will probably be
Phoenix right
you son-of-a-bitch
I hate the Jaco rats
it's an irritating fight not a fun one
the queens and kings of the rat kind
have lost the child here today for
slaughter your reward
all these fucking tokens
new maiden that's interesting
come play I do not want to just sit here
now we play you can now access endless
mode if you wish to test your skills
against chance itself so where do you
think I'm gonna die once
when's my death gonna happen some men
thrive in anarchy and chaos the king of
dust is one such his tools are cruelty
and terror and I suspect he will Harbor
a great Patriot
I need an extra I don't need any of this
shit hey Sadie Nate
yeah
and about five to six years for you rich
huh I get it
you fuckers can be so cruel so
unimaginably cruel
Oh
treasures always good
I need money loan isn't bad
in these lands the king of dust takes
his tithe
don't worry rich you'll always live
forever in my memories no I will not
because you will not live forever and
neither will your memories it's the
second we're all gonna die my kings I
can't live forever then no one can
that's what I say that forces with the
strength of their will they will turn
that power to your destruction all right
what is the curse for this go around
here what do you do okay gold will be a
problem oh you can't a good day to be in
steagle
ooh yes yes double yes I need fifty
spare coins for the Rat Man event which
is why I'm gonna do this to waste some
more food
very nice indeed
ooh the new maiden let us take a token
on their foolishness
the token is yours her let us see what
you do with your newfound abilities a
horse is a fine companion
I'm sure you'll leave this one in time
you do not seem to have the temperament
for friends the Rat Man event there's a
baron who if you give him $50
he will eliminate the rat man he will
call their numbers and that gets the
unlocks the rat men cards he could take
them out of your deck they're useless
cards that waste waste card slots with
just stupid rat men encounters that get
you nothing I want to get rid of them so
I need $50 to pay a baron do you
comprehend the stakes
I will happily wager on the outcome I do
not think you have what it takes
yeah
Hey
don't pretty good doing pretty good
rich have you ever been involved in a
road rage incident I ran an 80 year old
woman off the road once bitch deserved
it
your provisions are running low can you
press on
these places are rife with power it is
not chance that you should meet a wall
up here
Oh a trap I hid a trap
all right I still have enough to pay the
Baron and I'm getting food which is very
good I'm sure you a grateful for that I
better run across the Baron if I don't
I'll be upset
what brings you to play the game I know
you will not tell me like all the rest
you are silent
my bandits are solely loyal to their
king they will not let you reach him
easily
right
I'm actually talking you just can't hear
me that's true look this enriched having
solo stream and when I play a game where
I need to concentrate I'm almost gonna
be saying nothing maybe this game was a
mistake I don't know but I'm here I care
about you guys enough that I'm here like
they were looking forward to a stream
but I want to cancel the last minute I'm
doing a stream denied and you can't stop
me Jack he didn't try to stop me from
streaming then he thought wasn't gonna
do but just forgotten just for dramatic
purposes you can't stop me from
screaming straining screaming either
really I could scream if I wanted to I'm
not going to because I've been probably
injured most of your eardrums I know how
my voice works
I'm impressed
if you select these sorts of weapons
because nobody ever anticipates being in
peril
such misplaced confidence is usually
their downfall 10 food yes this time I
don't think I had to do anything too
well this wasn't so an average Nelson
counter
damnit
damnit
damnit
you may have to contend with every
bandit in the kingdom before you read I
didn't have the iron price I would have
paid the iron price but it didn't hit
I better get something good for that
card so now I don't have enough money to
afford getting rid of the Rat Man if I'm
at my ten even run across that guy so I
guess it's alright CEO Knox just the
rattmann are and why I want to get rid
of them get away from me
wait some cheese
whether I like it sell equipment really
is that what you're going to do I can't
solve that
will I be streaming for 12 hours no
actually I'm probably not gonna go that
late tonight cuz I've got a huge day
ahead of me tomorrow I'm gonna be from
busy from morning till night
so probably done when I die in this
are there any ill effects from selling
this shit
but on the next combat encounter
all right bare minimum
I've got the bare metal
an expedition press on did you expect me
to tell your fortune no a fortune teller
is at their most base and despicable
when they begin to believe their own
lies
now of course I am different this was
the hardest there's a token in it for
you if you win
yes
all right everybody in the chat all
right everybody
please pay attention all right please
pay attention
oh my god it was on top both times it
was on top both times I I just by
amazing luck I got a very hard token to
get because the important card appeared
on the top of the deck both shuffles and
I was able to easily track it many of
these blessings are too good for the
likes of you
yeah take it
Wow I'm sorry about yours I actually
believe it or not I moved the mic away
from my face I actually I moved the mic
over here I'm not sure how well you're
hearing me now but that's how far the
mic was away and I looked up so I
apologize I thought that would be enough
to lessen the impact of the whoo it was
it was not and I am sorry I was happy
about that though our bandits are
displeased with your challenges
golde golde now come on baron all right
I don't know what happens here win this
and claim my token minding my own
business at a local tavern when suddenly
three masked men burst through the doors
grab a young a young man from the bar
and manhandle him outside one page and
burst out in protest but is quickly
silenced but some stairs of all those
around him they even be garrote it is
time that must be done I follow the
master Tigers outside yeah sure why not
Oh God fire rats
and I no longer have enough money for
the Baron I won't but I got the token
for this
now you have reached a point from which
the path ahead is unclear what will be
your solution
what's everybody thinking what is
everybody thinking
two or three oh three yes Thank You Chad
thank you yes you guys earned that token
Goomer scenario contract at downwards if
you dare
at their heart all games are about power
are they not the acquiring of power the
retaining of power and most importantly
the use of power a challenge for you and
a token if you succeed
easy
yes yes fine fine I'm sure you're
grateful for that
we play for a token now
see what just happened there was that
that encounter with the devil it started
me off with low health and the weapon
I'm using gets stronger to lower your
health is plus undead our week two maces
and it's a mace so it just devastated
them
yeah again the surprise attack the
novelty must wear thin on subsequent
travels six bandits to keep you on your
toes
nice
what am i fighting what do you do
there's no strength like I've got medium
armor I think no I sold the medium armor
what's your deal fire in its
multitudinous forms we still hold it in
esteem and Wonder
we'll go offense
one food work your way through the woods
and see what lies beyond yes our lives
are often lived that's are they not
pushed back and forth by the whims of
nobility or power
rats have so few friends amongst mankind
yet the two have lived in close
proximity throughout the ages and are
more similar than either would care to
admit actually you know what I know one
of these two is gonna be a Rat Man
encounter so I'm just gonna equip that
shit anyway for now but honestly these
are what unlock more tokens every game
must include an element of surprise
wouldn't you say sometimes it is the
human on the other side of the table
sometimes the drawer of a card or the
roll of the dice without it the game is
nothing but a computing machine
kick their ass
yes James for Amma as you will yeah so
we're gonna be anything I want here
probably not
but doesn't hurt a check right all right
we got what do we got heal wounds remove
curses yeah
fuck it
where is Luke remember he can only ask
why that was so different
roaming ever forward hunting for the
truth on this floor the king of dust
waits for you he is prepared are you
knew I was gonna start running into the
rat men our old friend the Jack of
plague returns to fight another day
when a rich will change his mind about
the review now that he's got the master
hand of fate I don't think I hated it to
begin with though I like to hand to fame
oops wrong button
charity ah the wandering mendicant will
humanity ever move beyond poverty
religion and charity
yeah I got playing
the gods look upon you favourably so
much good shit this run and then
proceeds relentlessly with each step you
will discover a new card and a deeper
mystery we meet the jack again did you
think him done before Oh shuffle back
into the deck to rise again to the top
as are we know King falls without a
challenge
I'm surprised to see you turning your
back on gold alright that's a pretty
good runner
a choice select your desire
oh god I've got so much shit it's
ridiculous
all right and I expect to run across the
king soon and what do you do you damage
Weiss yeah
desperate measures measures slightly
better for that the the cleaver is good
against rats and does extra damage but I
switched in time but it's shame I
couldn't explore everything oh well I've
done okay
come on
oh she did already
not quite
dodge my dad you fucker
are you dead yet keep getting aggressive
miss I keep thinking he's near death and
one hits gonna do it and it never does
there are many who will be pleased that
you have defeated the likes of my lesser
game that's for me I don't take a
bathroom break you have but let me look
at my booty first I mean the spoils of
war have my ass
you're not gonna grab me or look at my
ass and beard decay people take like a
mirror look at their own ass and admire
it does that ever happen
lesbians ever look at their own boobs I
would
rich do I believe in the healing power
of therapeutic crystals no I can only
assume that's a joke asking me that
did I not see chasing amy i saw it but i
saw that like in the theaters when it
first came out i don't i don't remember
much about chasing amy the mall I wonder
all right now I'm thinking about it
right
take your time if you like I've waited
long enough
right
okay you know because I have an early
and long day tomorrow I think I'm gonna
call it quits after this round here but
it should be a longer one the suit of
scales are represented by these lizard
men I going back to like Windows 10 and
now what not I noticed something
interesting earlier today cuz I have
incarnated assumed I was looking at the
system requirements for the new doom II
laughter after everything that like you
know what I'm gonna go back even further
to quantum break right quantum break
which ran like garbage on my system I
met all of the recommended specs
except for RAM which I was still at the
minimum for I wasn't over in the limit I
was an overpowered with Ram as far as
quantum break was concerned but it was
at the limit and that fucker ranted two
frames per second so I'm like what what
are the requirements for Doom I better
I'm gonna find out just just in case I
do wants me to have 16 gigabytes of RAM
and I looked
turns out I meet dooms like ultra specs
across the board but operating system
for the new doom it specifically says in
the new dooms requirements windows 7
it doesn't say windows 10 it says
windows 7 and I find that greatly
amusing
which since all third person shooters
are bad did you ever play max payne 3 I
haven't played max payne 3 but yes it's
exactly what I said
said all third-person shooters are bad
in fact all third person games are bad
this game right now I hate it because
it's the third person
no I don't want the recommended deck I
want my own deck
that's not bad
you do again
that's not terrible either
your stupid pants let's get rid of ones
I've done
hmm what do I want
I know mr. Lionel ends up big bad after
a while he starts taking things from you
so I don't want him I think that comes
with treasurer think that goes a
treasurer right
but I can't like a doom for just do I'm
calling it doom is you know what I'm
talking about you have taken one of my
symbols suppose I should call a doom for
my scepter
scales ah this layout again listen fuck
Arvixe have been raised there is no
weapon I will not use against you
dry the skull keep your eye on the skull
skulls on top don't want that frost Fang
all right
I like frost fit a chance to discover
what your heart probably nothing I can
afford
ah let us see how you progress with that
millstone around your neck of course you
can remove your curses at shops if you
can find them still I'm keen to see how
you handle your disadvantages
again a token is at stake
how's it easy token
what do you do
what do you think I've already got a
decent weapon frost Fang
ah freezing enemies in place could be
good another token brings you closer to
your goals oh that's true ice is
effective against lizards and I am
fighting the lizard men I gotta fight
the jack of lizards so yeah yeah
or people leaving the C Civil War I
don't blame you it's fine I'm not gonna
be streaming too much longer this is the
last section of the game I'm playing
through I'm getting to them I mean
they're getting to the jack of scales or
I'm dying and then I'm done either way
easy easy
it doesn't hasn't heard that I got a
decent weapon early max hold food always
good always good I appreciate especially
with that wasteful fucking starting
layout that was crap it is a pleasure to
see you play a ship at dock is worth
nothing until it sails
as you plunder the secrets of your
memories you'll gain new cards some you
wish is left untouched
I've got decent amount of health
chat offer blood or refuse
I want the token I don't care how
dangerous it is
do I bleed yeah well who well easy come
easy go oh damn that hurt that's the
best blessing in the game though well
and health a recipe for a happy life
I doubt things will end that way mind
you
let us take a token on their foolishness
you know what I'll be fine everything's
gonna be just fine we're good
shet you're talking about doom 64 I I
know a lot of people like doom 64 but oh
god I can't stand the the new sprites I
just don't think they look as good and
then technically sure higher resolution
but just I love the design and the
classic doom sprites so much
Oh die
let's knew I never seen one of you guys
do an unblockable attack before
it's better than trudging along a muddy
road certainly
what brings you to play the game I know
you will not tell me like all the rest
you are silent
every game I have what do you want that
I don't have and losers without them it
degenerates into nothingness
I made that a little too powerful I will
have to rebalance that next time hmm I
have an accent a very good song
see what I can sell made food probably
nothing
fuck my nutsack
I have to do
because our foe under the circumstances
I got to take stairs did you expect me
to tell your fortune no a fortune teller
is at their most base and despicable
when they begin to believe their own
lies
I am different
my powers are genuine
sure sure why not
very nice indeed
choose from these options
food give me food food food damn it
I'm sure you agree fool for that no I'm
not
supplies yes rely victory from the jaws
of defeat with that shit is I will
happily wager on the outcome I do not
think you have what it takes
I'll have a lot of text for this one in
there geez
these hoes alright another free token
what do you got what do you got
armored that gives you the proportional
strength and power of a barbarian which
you are on closer examination
can I lose that's the question out can
Richelieu's know the answer is no I
cannot I'm sure I have now ultra win for
all timing to have the temperament for
friends even in the animal kingdom
when I dreamed long ago my dreams were a
flight
I figured what the right move is here
I'll be free
yeah kind of Rumson for me
so often this is how the story ends is
it not the hero tries the hero dies
their memory is celebrated but they are
lost
are you sure that's the right approach
I appreciate your ingenuity I look
forward to seeing how you approach this
particular challenge
haha the count enters the picture
oh my - I'm too blessed for this to work
apparently that's what I'm assuming
normally you'd you let him suck some of
your blood and you get a thing so what
should I do attack or flee
I guess attack right how do those people
leaving with chat and leaving the stream
have a nice night I'm going for attack
but I don't get the token is what it is
oh yeah
it's not enough that you kill them
you'll cuss them too
gloves are good that's why I took them
look look deeply this is the fate of
heroes
many of these blessings are too good for
the likes of you so many blessings it's
a miracle
if you if you tipped it should be saved
we're streaming on Friday I will browse
read them all on Friday Street this is
kind of somewhat of an impromptu thing
here I don't have Jack's laptop which
has all the other than the tip software
on it and I don't have my Windows seven
Drive I got the windows seven one eye
ten one that I had to install for
chronobreak yada yada but I don't have
the tip software on my PC so uh Jack
could make it tonight and I don't have
any way to read tips Friday Friday that
will happen Friday Friday will probably
be probably be Phoenix right on Jack's
3ds it's enough to put you off crossing
at bridges like this surely there's an
alternative that would leave you less
exposed and vulnerable
did we hate this game I don't recall
ever hating this game I like hand of
fate
Wow that cold glass is really freakin
finicky now I don't remember being that
hard to freeze people before
I'm sure you agree fool oh the map
that's a really important card right out
I always forget what do you do being
tougher than you look is a very
considerable advantage every dying man
would trade wealth for health
the ring the ring the problem with the
ring here's here's what the ring does
the ring when this ring is sold all of
the players gold is lost but the player
receives +1 max health for every 5 gold
lost as a result of the sale so I only
get one extra health for every 5 coins I
only have 2 coins right now I don't want
to bet on gaining a bunch of gold that I
probably won't gain meanwhile the armor
I'm wearing the Berserker armor I think
that counts as light this will knock it
up to medium I'm ill with a helmet
I know next I'll get a ton of gold but
shit happens
shit happens were you hoping this was
the end no another floor of waits and
I've run into so many shops there might
not even be many more shops ahead of me
as fine Lizard Men are nothing if not
patient he waits for you
take it so I got next to nothing for
that all right
this token will unlock more cards if you
can defeat this encounter
I gotta figure out this guild masters
ring thing exact card to show up there's
a token in it for you if you win
colonel rich mustard the things that
watch time and time again usually our
movies over watch TV shows over it over
an adventure brothers always happen for
a venture brothers on my pcs playlist
now I've not seen the new season yet I
don't have basic cable I'm waiting for
it to come out in DVD are you afraid of
the grave what irony C sharp I could
have sold that ring but I got no gold so
I made the right choice ha
oh it's an Adult Swim's website well I
might I might catch up out of them are
they all there
what sort of scoundrel would go through
a sleeping man's belongings oh I need
cable to log in to watch it okay yes
that's not happening win this and claim
my token
Oh 30% of my gold oh no that's bad
though
one more piece of the puzzle for you
alright just in time I'm Netflix but I
don't like Netflix has the current
season of Venture Brothers
does venture brothers I mean does
netflix have season 6 of The Venture
Brothers
oh this is too easy
ice weaknesses for the win
easy
hmm well played well played indeed you
have defeated something that I never
expected to die
guy looks look at all my unlocks the
wand represents my will in the purest
sense it is not too late for you to give
up now go peacefully to your fate and
you begin to assemble a credible deck
let us see what happens next
rich say some stuff that Jack would say
it's true we really do
not a bad little run
my soft way done all right let's see if
I can figure out whose sub tonight
favorite color blue or possibly red

Friday that's that's the current plan I
believe it's going to be Phoenix right
on Jack's 3ds so y'all get to watch us

believe for both me and Jack the only
thing I know about Phoenix right is he
says objection

there will probably not be a stream on
Sunday because Mother's Day so there's
that but I will see everybody on Friday

nice night
