[Part I]
I'll say different things I really don't
give a shit my clock says it is 559 that
is the time I'm going by so so second
second I'm here at all we normally we
started these things at 8:30 I'm
starting at 6:00 and everybody is
complaining that is so sad
so absolutely sad okay I'm game I am
playing today would be works must die
why thought I had that up already on the
screen I did not start the game game is
starting this game is happy start rated
t blood gore and violence that's good
that's good
knows everybody's digging
and when doing fine there's everything
sound fine I assume everything sounds
fine this is a game volume like relative
to mine is that good
oh I'm not I'm not I'm not sad chat I'm
just I'm just cold
I just walked to the local gas station
to get something to drink and it is cold
out and this godforsaken city there's
God forsaken part of the world all right
we're gonna all right most people are
saying good so good good all right we're
gonna we're gonna slay some fucking orcs
this is the game and here is game I have
played to this game before but I am
starting on a new profile we're gonna go
through the game from scratch okay and
I'm not sick I'm just sniffling because
it's fucking cold outside okay here are
my goals for the game I'm going to play
on the the normal difficulty the warm
aged difficulty because you know easy
normal and hard they can't just do that
that's to starting from scratch my goal
is to get through the game not gonna
guarantee it at all but the attempt I
want to do five skulls on every map
which is kind of a perfect perfect score
I'm not gonna happen probably not gonna
happen not near the end but that's my
goal
barring that and I want to not die once
and not let any works past me I might I
might I might do bad on time but at the
very least I don't want to let any of
them damn orcs through I'm gonna click
on the Go button to start the game
oh my god I didn't press the key to
continue
I've spent 300 years fighting for the
order
I've killed thousands of orcs and
defended dozens of rifts and this is how
it ends one slip and a kobolds blood and
my skull cracks open on the gatehouse
steps so now the task of defending this
fortress falls to my apprentice that's
it then the world is doomed it's all up
to me now
rest well crazy old man first things
first let's see what he left me in this
spell book okay chap I am disappointed
it you know and not everyone in the chat
of course but some of you you damn well
know I do not skip cutscenes when when
it comes to games
I am the anti Jack uh here's how the
game works
you hold on I gotta I gotta invert my
why is the game to lob the game sounds
fine
assuming the game sounds fun
I didn't hit except girly
yes invert the fucking why I didn't
click on it three times because I didn't
want to do that oh my god alright so
here's this you're in this little this
little fantasy fortress area right and
this is a big glowing thing that is a a
dimensional rift that that leads to the
human world which I'm not sure whether
or not that's supposed to be earth in
this fantasy setting but that that leads
to human world this door outside of the
rift
what's pounding on that door are
thousands of angry orcs and they're
gonna break this door down and they're
gonna try and run all the way down here
into the human world where they will
wreak havoc and you see these little
blue lines going across that shows the
path that the orcs are generally going
to take and so then you have all these
different spells and traps you can only
pick so many of them at a time and you
put these traps down and these traps
kill orcs or slow them down or they do
something to assist with the orking the
fortress
yes I said we working because way around
we're gonna deep work the shit out of
this place there we go come the orcs
so I step on these little traps in the
spikes c'mon
in addition to my crossbow my infinite
ammo crossbow obviously bees first
levels are to be really bad easy
oh yeah
first wave is done in between waves you
get like a you seen I count down to
seven and six you get a little little
breather to set up more traps and I'm
sitting down like a car trap so they get
by my spikes the spikes skewer them then
they get the tar and the tar slows down
they get that far I can I can cut them
down with my sword its sward right
because it's got a W
we cut them down by cutter there
absolutely no threat at all see what
that I mean I'm in a reference to pain
there please
like
things are progressing well I don't even
need more crashing oh sit sit down or
just it'll hurt a lot
yeah just just me for now jackal will
show up later but now until exactly get
me around 8:30 till then it's gonna be a
quiet rich solo stream
talk and play game
how many of you are actually please
actually the first one doesn't have
co-op when Jack when Jack shows up we've
got a different plan actually after
after I string through this I might
stream Orcs Must Die to does have kalam
I guess I guess some other time I'd be
willing to play that and people can join
in but right now right now I'm just
doing the solo
all right as first few aren't that
excited I mean they're pretty pretty
basic level sir but the old man dead and
my apprenticeship finally over I can
draw on the full power of the rift I'll
get a new toy to play with every time I
defend a rift so for beating that last
level we got a new trap or a new item
every I guess you call them levels and
not missions whatever you want to call
them every stage you get a new weapon or
item respect the role all so we're gonna
use the arrow law these down here okay
so I guess I'll use them these are the
the DLC items yeah maybe a bit okay
but this fine actually happen
I just want to show you one facing the
ceiling zapper it's like a club zapper
for orcs
this is the best tower defense game on
stream i and steam I think so I haven't
played many tower defense games say the
honest truth I know
3d Dot Heroes has like a minigame tower
defense that I really like I probably
should play more because I kind of like
really liked this game I will know what
I will endeavor to seek out more tower
defense
wire hangers
why are you saying why understand you
want me to keep my children no more wire
hangers nobody nobody gets that than
they do you or whoever said that
Oshin
almost almost had a father
I forgot this entertaining and should
endeavor to fuck up walk
think of us a Futurama joke but it was a
mother robot like a child robot and the
child robot had hanging wires out of you
know out of its robot body and the
mother said no more hanging wires this
joke
mommy dearest Joe robots can't tell
jokes
there's the organiz hammer you'll see
what that does I guess it's kind of
obvious
other
$800 item akiles
Oh
flex and items have a secondary fire to
it crossbow like you saw I was doing the
studies people buy you some time
the sword specialist knock back don't
get much you said about
they'll like this
try this on for size put down some more
force bikes
yeah he's pretty much on the rails and
basically I've basically already wood
this needs Conan the Barbarian music
this needs heavy metal
guilty hug skinny pants get to go
fishing what's up
why can't its austerity
there we go on the rails on the rails
it's fine everything's fine I'm gonna
sail through this game no problems no
problems at all
by upgrades you can upgrade so you get
you get a number of skulls this you were
like reward for beating level if you do
really good you get five some orcs get
through you get four and so on and so
forth and then you can use those skulls
later to upgrade things tar is something
you end up using constantly it cost a to
upgrade its goals to upgrade I have ten
skulls yeah I'm gonna upgrade them all
right there we go
another day another fortress another
riff to defend they always seem to break
through the doors we should do something
about that this level usually gives me a
problem with the the par time there's
the time you have to beat it in to get
an extra skull and I had issues with
that and I'm gonna use the scorcher
stick-up thing that pops out of the
ground and shoots fire fire good
Frankenstein was wrong fire
good Frankenstein's monster
Frankenstein's monster who wasn't
hitting it I'm gonna get that wrong that
fucker jumping down my throat
not knowing that Frankenstein was the
name of doctor one for you yeah I know
alright here we go
skull some orcs
I smell
they love their skeletons isn't that
just the coolest thing
that one floor thing more will be at it
oh we have our first new enemy here
these are the crossbow works they shoot
at you I think that's obvious stuff
oh he didn't turn into fire oh there
I just don't stir bother you that bother
your sensibilities
this is a straight line headshots on the
wall
easy-easy of getting cocky things are on
the rails
I just gotta worry about beating you
time
it always seems to trip me up on this
you think that's better you see that
suppose Assam pops up there my old
strategy on this used to be too
guitar traps in there that I just
shooted the acid possible
I guess it takes you too long to walk up
there so tell him as many of them as I
can as early as I can occur
headshots
also you get a combo score based on the
number of traps that are affecting the
works
Sophie was watching through a car trap
while more things are sending fire his
way and like an arrow trap on the wall
with shooting arrows a time that that
that booster scored I'm not worrying so
much about combos going straight up
going none of the traps damage you
because this would be Terry a like I
couldn't even walk through here if the
traps damaged me so I'm fine I can walk
through swinging Mason it's kind of
necessary
it's game to be unfolded
wildly inaccurate machine gun fire
oh sure
I survived rub the Dancy does victory
dance
music great
right
I continued on you get the window for
beating that last state mushroom to work
with he think it's kind of an underrated
item for the orcs from the gate this
pits around to see this come in handy
sword cut a twin belt go with arrows tar
spikes
rocks come out of here they like to go
on either side this one say the blue
lines show where they go
typically
guitar right in front of the arrows so
by the time they get to it slows him
down some more cluster behind them
before the arrows go off wait chat
saying you can barely join me do you
want me to turn the music copper you
want me to turn me up what what is wrong
with the sound jet let me know let me
know what is wrong with the sound music
no wait am i doing my music turning
music up returning music down sound is
all good sounds good to me sounds fine
alright everything's staying as it is
one one spike traps not going to be much
golden edges I will add to it later
sunshine enriches troublesome times rich
mothers all the time
that's what I do
what was had by all
just keep adding spikes they're working
up great I assume they will keep working
out great
that's great everything's great
headshots will be
standard orcs like instantly
hang back pick offs money as I can from
a distance left traps do the rest
they get close switch to the belt
and dodge the fire one
how about some of this oh yeah
so first-person mode on this game help
it's not that I'm aware of
mom I know somebody's monitored
oh shit thank you
the back of the eye
a little present for you one for you and
one for you that's gonna leave a mark
rich do you like any realtime strategy
games I've talked about before I really
don't like real-time okay too stressful
trying to juggle two different things
that are going on once and two different
sides of the map with with strategy
games I prefer to have plenty of time to
just think about what my next move is I
don't care if it's not realistic is my
preferred style of play which is why I
love XCOM don't typically care much for
something like Starcraft
just going according to
he's fun
do this
that's down here we're not gonna get
that far but put those traps down anyway
say Chad I don't like the tension of
real time it's it's it's kind of
horrible that that horrible juggling
okay what's going on over here and all
guy did you try to manage things you
can't yes I'm sure there are people who
are godlike in those things but I can't
manage strategy with that because you
got to keep it simple because you're
juggling it's like I was playing a home
world I mean I like everything else
about a whole world other than the fact
that it's a real-time strategy game home
world I was like trying to juggle my
fighters at the same time I was juggling
my capital ships and it wasn't fun just
a headache
Jack talks about story and gameplay
homeworld is great I don't know if you
think that's up his alley or what image
action click the world just the manual
for that game the way they manage to
tell a story without having a direct
narrative with characters it's pretty
good it's like I remember the right the
manuals kind of written like a history
book for the race
ah we're done already
that one faster
yeah I saw that homeworld is being
released it's just I like everything
about homeworld other than the game I
like the idea of playing around with
large plates of ships I just don't like
the turn and though the real-time combat
this is like who's not much reason for
me to buy it I I had a copy of home
rolled back in the day I really wanted
to get into it I really did it's just
yeah I couldn't I couldn't all these all
these great ships and they're just
disposable units to build as many as you
can you send them out and things blow up
and you don't have time to coordinate
things ah it's not it's not for me
upgrade so I have I don't have the next
thing I have more upgrades not upgrading
anything we're gonna continue on rich is
too good at this game
not enough fuck-ups these are the early
levels trust me things are gonna get a
lot more difficult these attacks see
more
works for me I like it when all the
enemies bunch up for mass slaughter I I
predict
I am just going to coast through the
first nine stages that's my prediction
I could be horribly wrong and this could
end in some kind of humorous disaster
but my prediction is the first nine
stages coasted through no problems
things get hairy after that
we do my best though much to your
disappointment I'm gonna try my best
those little guys are kobolds they are
really quick and they run straight from
the ex they don't stop the Crichton
we got to watch out for that
when does the steam going till I read me
a while I mean Jack's gonna show up in
830 ish and we'll be streaming more
after that so I think you get a while
with streaming I mean until Jack shows
up it's just gonna be me
battling a little bit here and there if
you want you know I wouldn't even blame
you if you wanted to go away come back
home maybe enjoy time together people
you chat and that's reason to stick but
we know we know how great a conversation
I am when I'm just
especially when I'm playing a game now I
know not this next way but sooner or
later people are going to start pouring
out of this door so I'm just it sparing
a little bit early for that setting some
traps down in anticipation oh that is
this way
can't go back
I said those down when I did I could
have gotten ugly step right this way
stork
don't with some more
defenseless here
both the store and that other door
they're all coming around this corner so
I'm moving my archers over here
all right open the door
this exploding peril don't forget it yes
I think that would be a handy thing
really
a combo or a four on some of those
that's not bad oh by the refs see my
hubble's letting up a little bit low
just head by the rift in the rift
take these guys all out this on fence
set up over here
really overpowered
it's one of the DLC items I guess that's
that's the thing with deal secret isn't
it sometimes you get something that's
just overpowered
everybody bunches up around the barrel
and I blow the boards
we pour it and now there we go there we
go
not bad at all you'll see it's just a
way for a game's creator to realize
their little mission Oh bullshit blow
that out your ass teal'c's a cheap
fucking money-making scheme it's a way
to cut out content and charge you more
for it fuck you shove your DLC up your
ass
I'm creating those archers instantly
yes I got a little bit mad but we're
still friends we're still friends
another attack where our defenses are
thin if I didn't know better I think the
orcs were learning
so you get the entire before each level
I mean I already kind of know especially
there's at least really levels so I
don't need to survey around but you know
you have as much time as you want on the
normal difficulty to walk around before
the door gets knocked down and just to
plan out your attack like this one
the orcs come out of here and they split
up some good on that path and then some
go all the way up here and around so
then the new item I got for beating that
last mission was barricade and you can
use this to block out paths because you
it's it's to your advantage if you can
kind of funnel everybody into one area
so you can you can concentrate your
defenses out that one spot so rather
than letting the orcs go in two entirely
different directions I'm gonna block off
one of them and then gonna stack my
defenses in the other area take my sword
you know it's taking like the word
and I got a barricade which you're
actually you know what let's take a
wooden belt
it's like barricade and take an archer
its tar that's really all I need the
next one would just be padding and
fucking think yeah I think a barrel case
I want to blow something up I might use
that but I'm gonna block off this upper
path here right there so you see the
blue arrows now that you put the
barricades down the little blue lines
they come here and they stop they turn
around they go the other way I mean your
barricades gonna work if you completely
block off their access to the the
glowing blue rift they will break
barricades down they won't let you block
access to a barricade but if you just
block a path to one and there's another
path they'll take the other path and I
got this nice little overlook here and
we're gonna can afford mini right now
but we're gonna load this up with
archers and then we're gonna put the the
bottom bridge area down here we're gonna
slap some tar down there and we're gonna
win we're gonna win
unleash the hordes
many as you can of wants over home
quick though right
easy start throwing down some talk alert
archers will come next
great
best Star Trek captain anyone are you
saying Hart trap tower Trek as a joke
because I'm using the taro down there
was that a clever pun or was that just a
typo I'm going to assume typo I could be
wrong archers and it's just all gonna
get easier from here on out
launched up
he's easy
good times quick I go back into the
frame
a chance ass-kicking right there I don't
need trips just gonna kick everyone's
ass
these guys will just pull mom down like
the really kind of music
ever
more archers
so sorry for them
I guess I did use that barrel
we'll see if I need it
last wave
look at that look at that look at that
all into the acid
and you put down traps between ways
during the very food
you can't sell them during the way we
put more down
oh yeah like I said these these early
ones are gonna be pretty easy especially
if you know what you're doing there's
some stages down the road though they
just they basically just scare me
spring-trap this these are fun they're
not necessarily the most efficient
weapon but I personally get a lot of use
out of them this map there's a top right
- there's also a little mini-map
everything that's going on with an arrow
that's human it's really useful
sometimes we got two big doors and they
both go down these two hallways now
I can't barricade things off up here
because you're chill just break through
because there's no other way through but
I can put a barricade up on this side
because then they'll just go through
that middle hallway and I can funnel
them somewhere probably gonna have
archers focus on one side while I
personally take out the rest and acid
pits so I'm using a window
Archer barricade arrow spring
that's a fine loadout
they're all gonna come through on this
side which is where I won't put arrows
one little barricade here just to make
sure they don't like you know sneak
through here without catching any arrows
that's all my money that's all I can do
they are all dead healed up back into
the fray leave they come out on the
other side next we're in theory they
won't run into my arrows but they're
gonna die well before
get some archers up here cuz eventually
they're gonna start coming out of both
doors at once but he's first now notice
that there's one other stage
mr. spring traps
this will be good
spring-trap Birchers myself now they're
coming out of a forest a little bit
harder our first older
is he enough to do West it's harder when
they're bunched up with a whole bunch of
other words you're gonna get set off my
arrow traps you're already dead
possessed
holger on the other side oh shit hurry
up hurry up hurry up run run run run run
run
shit choo-choo choo-choo choo-choo
oh that got close that got real fuckin
close whoo
it's fun to watch it never look at that
look at that flying
okay
brutal
she's alive no deaths no orcs have
gotten through it so far every stage
five schools not doing bad put down some
more archers and if I can make this side
basically completely self-sufficient
that's good
yep there you go thanks Kong
ultra-smooth yes they are elf archers oh
I think names gonna call an elder in the
description tonight I'm not sure they
have the plate
I'll die
in the
if it ain't elven it ain't archers so so
they've never been real archers in
history every every every Archer has
been an elf I think you're wrong
come down
ostermueller
there we go
grace no I don't wish probably upgrade
the barricades but I think I think I'm
gonna throw my muse
except upgrade and let us move on my fan
of Lord of the Rings not not really as a
general rule I don't like generic
fantasy and Lord of the Rings is kind of
the originator of generic fantasy so
this map is actually pretty hard no acid
pits and a reason to bring the air belt
it feels cheap but I'm going I'm going
with the acid sorry a little bit cheap
and I'm gonna use archers and I'm gonna
use tar Scorchers and then we just got
this wall trap I'm gonna pick up one of
these
what do I consider on generic fantasy a
Star Wars
I'll think you know what I'll think of
more on that later but right now my game
is taking up too much of a percentage of
brain to think of other fantasy worlds
that have been less generic than your
standard fantasy with elves and orcs and
and and and with a little guys called
the dwarves
two-for-one are sure
so I kind of know this math I know the
first couple waves they're only out of
this door and then things get really
difficult on that door down there when
they break down that door and they're
coming out of both at once not good not
good
yes yes Dark Crystal would be
non-generic fantasy you don't see
Skeksis often or those weird four-legged
stilt things
I suppose he man can even kind of
counted
make it up with the Scorchers
that down below
and you know every in a few waves
sometimes to give you a break or you can
have as much time as you want to reach
your traps where you want them to be
don't let them all slow down and cluster
up before the flames pop up and in
theory I believe I can kill more that
way
important archers and then I'm just
gonna take out everybody that comes
through on the bottom on my own
take off
these guys
damn you
long sigh closely
or just be dumb
more archers will traps by the door
get get get thank you go mom the
Gauloise the guard okay
kill kill death right word die
we get smaller the other other white
meat
yeah
by
whoo
absolutely we'll run them down
who wants more traps I know between me
and the straps it should be enough
everything else archers
and he said like only two words yes
it's enough
keep an eye out constantly keep one eye
on that Minnie Mouse picture sometimes
sweetie by past those stairs
easy
what
yes
I'm not talking because you're getting
intense
yes archers archers archers more archers
that's already
as doing well hopeless top I like it
these jerks
they handled everything look great
run-run
oh shit
where are you
yes
ah split a ssin this game looks a
dynasty Warriors easy because I'm making
it look that way plus I'm still in the
early stages six upgrade points
I think barricades will be next Oh
woo
is anyone gun here we go ah the steam
trap which is completely useless
this is a trap New York walks over they
they just float up into the air for a
bit that's the trap that's what it does
it float mean they come back down then
they come back down what's what's going
on
smartness
acid pits some bring in a window and
archers archers archers all traps not
use it's our this time we're gonna get
some use out of the springs and then
that bad need anything else I don't need
anything else I'm gonna use some vampire
gloves what's the use of the steam trap
the steam trap I know it's it supposedly
it's good for building up combos if
you're going for a score like if the
stream leads up into an arrow that's
placed above the wall and you can you
can do combo II kind of things with them
but right now I'm not interested in that
I'm interested in death I'm interested
in orc murderer
like catnip for orcs
right
defense is set up
all of them
another door
this would be good
it sucks their health into you which I
suppose should be obvious based on the
name
it should look at thing tumble around
I got full minute without talking
members and main Shakman
right
but you guys can't wait till I have
somebody to talk to
I kept talking play games at the same
time not alone in that
this you made the name or
so that just happened don't okay we're
doing okay some new decorations traps
over here make this area self-sufficient
I can put in some more walled shoppers
over here something through your face
and stay the course things going well
things are going just swell how could
you love a gem in Seoul those dreams
they're terrible I've been quiet for the
last 25 minutes
just kill them just killing orgs it's
all I'm going and that's entertainment
huh easier than I thought
that's which cheap way
that VLC stuff is just overpowered
cement I did that mostly for speed
last wave just gonna load up purchase
nothing to do
it's already over
or should just give up
the dynamic
oh no that's oh shit
yup
oh I guess if you're tuning in late I
explained it when the when the game
started the orcs are trying to get to
the rift it's like a tower defense game
the rift is this blue glowing
dimensional portal portal that leads to
the human world and the orcs want to get
in there and just kill everything and
you have to stop them from getting into
the dimensional portal the rift I'll
I'll show everybody who didn't tone in
at the start of the stream that they
started the next to Matt and I can't
afford to upgrade my barricades yet one
more skull you get a lesser score if
work one or gets through I mean you
could let quite a few through uh I don't
I don't I don't know I think I think
they all have to get in for you to lose
but I mean it's kind of you know just
feels bad
if you feel like one skull on a level at
the end of each level you get like a
score based on souls one one two five
skulls if you do a perfect job if you do
it in in the allotted amount of time and
nobody gets through you get five skulls
if you either take too long or one work
goes through the rift you lose the skull
and it was like such a percentage of
orcs get through then you lose another
two skull and so on dogs they just kind
of they kind of rate the performance and
all right you can see my my this this
number here on this particular stage I
can only 2020s the number that I have to
avoid that's the number every time it or
cuts through the rift that goes down one
so that counts down I can what twenty
through it's different in some of them
looks like a lot more someone's thrown
five some it's fifteen and let me let me
select my my load out here it's kinda
like a tower defense game so taking
taking my sward doesn't like the tarp
trap that slows orcs down this is acid
bombs that melt orcs arrow traps they
they go on the side of walls and work
orcs go by the arrow traps the arrows
fly out new to this level is the push
trap what you put on the side of a wall
and it's like a little spring that comes
out and it will knock works over it will
knock them off the side of cliffs if the
trap is putting your a cliff barricades
kind of lock off areas you'll see the
stuff in action so what happens is the
orcs first out of these doors doors or
my canadian and you see these little
little blue lines coming out that shows
you what path the orcs are gonna take so
they're gonna they're gonna split up and
go down either side of this thing and
they're gonna run down here and they're
gonna try and get in the rift here your
goal is to stop the orcs from getting
here so there's that door there and then
on this map there's an other door over
here so you're going to have to split
your attention between the two doors
and put barricades up so I have to worry
about less pathways I'm gonna keep the
orcs from getting through on your side
so all the orcs that come out of that
one door door I'm Canadian today why am
i Canadian all the orcs come out of that
door they're gonna they're gonna come
down through here so I know that I can
line this area with a lot of craps to
kill those particular orcs work sink
work a lot work work
I'm gonna push trap here so that'll
shove them into this acid bath it'll
hurt a lot
this will be good
yeah that's a good spot for that
first few waves I'm good and have to
worry about that other door down there
so my goal is to build up build up this
side so this side is pretty much
self-sufficient and then when the orcs
are coming through the other door I'll
be able to and
right there that's the spot oh he's a
good one
spring-trap
site is pretty good at handling its own
affairs though this area off because I
know the next wave they're gonna start
coming out of that back area so I have
to hope that these traps these traps
take care of all of them the orcs from
that door
and everything over here I'm gonna have
to handle on my own
why are the orcs trying to kill you it's
their works
they want to get into the game or to
rape and recovery soon
he'll up you up
I know these things I'm looking at
this'll hurt
remember
Grossman now they're coming out of both
doors
can you ever have too many traps
thinking no two more waves
I'm pretty good the pretty
self-sufficient
all right the last wave
work over whatever
whoo
eyes
there we go that's not really wool woody
it didn't get that close I mean I got a
little bit hectic in that last one but I
wasn't that that was not all worthy I'll
be one later on hopefully hopefully
gotta have a drink a loved one have your
drink
what upgrade my barricades Tim you wan
you want a semi whoo whoo how's that
said semi enough all right this is my
new item for meeting that level hot
chicks but you know that's just that's
just great I get hot chicks for beating
that level here's what I'll show you
what the hot chicks do after the
cut-scene adolescence I was a lousy
teacher but he was the worst kind of
student dim-witted foolish and too
stubborn to focus on the fundamentals
that's why the order paired us up they
sent their best and brightest to learn
from other more patient warm ages I got
the bottom of the
the joke's on them those brilliant young
minds are dead along with most of their
masters slaughtered trying to defend the
rifts the world is still doomed of
course there aren't enough war majors
left now there are laughs if the last
one left standing is him I've made
contact with the orders Weaver's on the
far side of the rift the weavers have
read all the old books they should be
able to hook me up with magic goodies
okay for the record my drink was Diet
Pepsi so I'm sorry I'm sorry it was Diet
Pepsi I just acted drunk because comedy
all right
pick up my weapon loadout first and
foremost
built in the polar gloves archers
arrows yes tar and push traps
hey I hate the later partner of the
stage I do
alright enough time for the chicks
they're called the weavers
I guess they weave spells I guess that's
their thinking there's the elemental
Weaver and the steel Weaver steel Weaver
augments like your your traps and your
your archers on other your Guardians I
have gotten the Paladin chapter like a
big guys with swords but they they she
enhances your the people you summon and
your traps the elemental Weaver she and
enhances like your weapons the spells
you use like the wind belt and you can
you can see like it has a little
description of like little upgrade paths
she has you can choose one of them you
don't you're not stuck with the whole
game every every level you get to choose
one of the two actually there's a third
one that pops up later but right now I
just have the two right now I'm going to
go with the elemental Weaver for 12,000
points upgrade your sword and put my
crossbow and my thwart death word I'm
gonna upgrade that
you see all right so enchanted weapons
game the flame crossbow and holy sword
I'm not gonna spend money on it just yet
but then you can further upgrade you
know Trent on the brush playerhealth
doubled melee kills make you faster then
the final upgrade you know crossbow and
blade staff kills grant 5% of the mana
bar which helps out with your spells
spells spells are okay they're not as
cool swords
it's right now where no beccamike I'm
gonna even need them so we're sticking
with we're sticking with the holy
weapons Cantona so you see my crossbow
was flaming and my swords got like a
blue glow that flies down my arm
she's pretty deep pretty neat alright
this particular stage is an upper level
and a lower level
the orcs come out from this door and
then up above me there's a pathway above
me when they come out in the door so I
have to split my attention between two
different portals it's kind of a bitch
so fish traps
knock the orcs down when they come
through this way oh I didn't take that I
didn't say alright I'm dead I didn't
take the forest or trees but I'm gonna
have some arrow traps up here
so you now know that that elemental
Weaver I'm much better at decimating
works about tribes
easy easy
coming up the top
by
right outside of they come out next I
don't remember where they come out next
it's okay I'll be fine
it's all good oh these are the Knowles
come truce these guys they don't care
about getting in the rift they just
tracked you down murdered he or any
archers
if they hit you you get like poisoned
and you slow down so it's kind of a pain
in the ass you're not careful these guys
can kill you pretty quick especially
when there's more than one
speed and health do i watch don't waste
what I've given or the more shit dark
it'll hurt a lot
that's gonna leave a mark
faster
that's gonna leave a mark right there
that's a spot
okay it's probably not enough secure of
problems on their own but
kill them all
kill them all great words of advice
down below
constantly look at the math - just to
make sure numbers sleeping up on that
I got the top again
anyone good for what in my arms just
take care of it it's 20 okay I'm
assuming nobody got through oh boy
how do I want to defend this area
got a little present for you one for you
and one for a few I want this bottom
area not require my attention at all
in fact I want to go now keep those
should I've got no
maybe I will do further Weaver upgrades
after this next wave something things
don't go horrible burn an arc for me
we've got to our archers just nice
frost affects 33% duration I don't have
the the ice spell yet though when belt
33% increased force I don't know if that
pushes them further which actually could
be bad I might blow them into the the
rift so I'm just gonna go with the
everyone use it's done that much but I'm
mites
chatez saying I don't love you what what
is what brings that on
here again
the exact same damn path
was it your okay you know that oh this
is it there's the grand finale
quick
go back up top traps can handle the
crossbow guys
oh my our skill good good good good
this is going well
I have no losses
none of these guys gonna make it to the
rim I don't wave of these guys all right
hurry up hurry up hurry up
am I gonna look easy oh wait they're up
top the red tongue
whoo that was a whoo
they want to upgrade
afford to upgrade anything useful
language when does this game get
challenging I am kind of a veteran at
this game it is challenging the we're
getting into the stages where things are
challenging I'm sorry for your ears see
now I say this is gonna get challenging
and I'm right now I'm about to make this
look very easy though that that last one
you don't realize how difficult that
last wave yes I made it I made it look
easy goddamn it try it yourself and see
God yeah whatever whatever
you people fire I have I have fire now I
can shoot fire from my fingertips
because I am a god
do I even need anything else
not really
never use one of these before
they like this one
that's
oh no with elements of again that work
small for me
typically we'll make a good team burning
oil
don't waste what I've given all right
here we go
like I said I'm gonna make this one look
very easy cuz there's just a blatant
choke point here they all run into
making it look too easy I have to dumb
myself down a bit this won't hurt a bit
this is this whole stage it's just kind
of a gimme
if you know the strategy this is a gimme
I'm just gonna lay out some archers and
we're just we're gonna coast we're gonna
coast this one's a breather this one's
like you need a break through the last
level or two so I take a pick a nap I
guess the name is a cute this is called
choke point and you're supposed to
barricade this up I think I think that
was the intent
yes sir fire safety jokes I get it I get
it
I understand breakfast
yeah on the rails
I don't even need to build more I don't
even summon more archers I'm pretty good
to go this is just overkill at this
point come on wake up
and yeah why the fuck not
excellent
it's not rumors that booth marchers
I'm behind the barricades
and away we go
they're not even getting to the llama
anymore I've got so many archers kind of
guitar you know what it is
this is overkill
they're not even getting to my my choke
point disaster area trap of doom of doom
I'm ready to get her bruised from
crowding myself on the back that heart
you're you're probably right
you won't be sorry
yep there we go I can't move that I
can't do that you won't be sorry rich I
won't be sorry for what what mister a to
mr. a to 12
um oh I didn't even use the dead man uh
thing whatever I don't need it alright
continuing on pounder I'm not gonna use
that a highly situational weapon that
doesn't come into use all that often
yeah I'm gonna use that see this is just
one large open area to rifts they can
run towards this one will be difficult
this might be where the first orchids
through
I'm gonna need archers no longer eat are
gonna use the wall choppers might use
arrows
though I use anything else
berrak it was so expensive to barricade
all this shit off
it's now
I could barricade but I wouldn't have
any money left for traps
that's the Scorchers
and we're going with steel Weaver
increases money from traps I have so
many things to shoot does that hole
right there that spot just for you
for you one for you and one for you
look at three four now
oh boy
there we go
looking good
kill up me heal up quick heal up Chris
you look quick
yes
whoo
straight with the fire arrow guardians
alright here's what she does
orcs killed by traps and Guardians are
in 66% 66% more coins Guardian armor
Guardians have increased health I took
that swagging at this burning pitch
elves gain flame arrows and generate
more combos actually if I do that I
won't have any money left to buy more
archers so maybe what I'm going to do
instead is I'm gonna buy a ton of
archers first and then the next chance I
get then I will start upgrading the
archers in the hopefully they can hold
that one dorm
decisive I like that
perhaps tutelage
burning arrows very well then
whoo all right now look at all that
money I got
I have money in fire archers turn into a
duck shoot
oh hello here what's up
let me try and turn your sound up on my
end here okay talk to me you're on the
air
we're we're in the thick of it we're
fighting off some orcs I've got I've got
flaming archers um which let me I'll tab
here how is how is Jack sound chat how
is Jack sound is he - cool he's
somebody's - quiet incredibly quiet all
right let me can I get to a menu in this
game without shutting it down well I'm
gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna mess of the
game sound and then I'm gonna turn you
up on open broadcaster okay as far as
Jack being echoey as they say as not
much I can do about that if that's the
case I'm gonna talk I could see where my
levels are Jack can you talk in my radio
friendly voice nice even
well-articulated
words okay chat how do I need to adjust
Jack because they need to be louder an
hour or C good what do you guys
she's still quiet all right I can fix
that I can fix that
Jack talk some more I'm talking some
more this is me talking at my normal
talking miss levelness way loader way
louder we we are at full volume which do
you need me to be louder like I can turn
up my mic on my end well let's see what
that day want me to try that okay your
town is next rich can't make me not dumb
I'm born dumb and I'm gonna die down
that's just the way life is okay now
you're gonna have to do it on your end
okay now I just said it on my end
and I was significantly louder to me you
just saw more echoey anymore well that
echo is not the right word form you
sound digitally ish like a digital fuzzy
kind of off buffle does that sound much
better does it sound much better if I go
like this no no okay
they're saying I sound distorted hold on
I'm gonna unmute this dream
oh is that I wonder if I was too
okay now am i you sound better I don't
know about volume but now now I don't
the distortion is gone okay I think I
might have been thinking as far as
making me louder that's all you this is
yeah yeah well we've had the issue when
I call him when you're doing the solo
streams and I'm quiet we might need this
to start and stop the stream oh sure
sure I could try that
yeah let's sort it still quiet I'm gonna
start and stop the stream everybody will
be back in one second

[Part II]
Govan Barca you know like it takes a
while to I love that better I hope you
saw our assumption yeah I'm looking at
the bars are my bar isn't incredibly
very okay okay well then I will do my
very best to way better know what sounds
much better
great jacket perfect Jack is loud stop
yelling at us never our limb reference
never never never I've made someone
tweeted at us that lovely technical
issues photo yeah did you see that oh
yeah I saw that I love the photo but why
do I have one differently colored eye
other than that it's kind of funny I
have no idea all I know is like I just
wanted that to be our default background
wallpaper because we have so many
technical twos yeah and a big thank you
let me thank the man I i retweeted it i
retweeted it so everyone could enjoy it
and now I need to find out who who sent
is that lovely that lovely uh image why
is it Enrique Esquiva I mean probably
messing up your name am i quiet compared
to Jack somebody's saying that I sound
quiet compared to you you sound good but
that I am quiet compared to you I don't
you could turn down for one but
basically should I turn myself up
you are rich I just talks people come
here to judge keep talking for a little
bit you know 44 viewers research bribe
while you were away
whoa 34 viewers thank you for
subscribing really appreciated H Christ
is that true
I don't know while we were away well we
like in that two seconds
that's impossible that's impossible
that's fun possible
um yeah you weren't you or I I just rich
audio was fine so I don't know you were
slightly quieter than me last time I
checked but uh let's let's just check
again yeah just you know what just like
a little bit like a pinch turn yourself
a paint job just do it a pinch but yeah
well here's what you do if you will rich
this is this is broadcasting 101 if you
think you're gonna make over a loud
noise turn away from your microphone I
you this you from my microphone is
strapped to my head oh is it yeah oh
well then well then that's I'm sorry so
what are we talking about before I make
it back to the game
what it'll we get let's talk about Orcs
Must Die this game looks fun oh it's
fucking awesome this game looks very
give it a shot I will I will give it a
shot a bit is this you know what my one
question was yeah is this the first
tower defense game to give you that
first-person perspective I don't I don't
know about that yeah but it did those
put you into the game I think it's I
think it's brilliant I think it's great
it looks like a lot ah it looks like a
lot of fun I'm making it look easy yeah
I'm doing people say this is something
that's a challenge but I'm I'm honestly
making it look easy because you're so
good at third yes rlm reference
third-person perspective I I meant is
this the first tower defense game that
actually lets you get into it it's
you get into the action I assume that
was what you meant and everybody else
who was reasonable she'd have assumed
the same thing you know it's fine go
everything's fine everything's fine all
the time rich you know that no that's if
that's a that's all we want to talk
about for now if you want to keep
playing I say keep playing later I'm
gonna play a game that I've been playing
for a little bit today know what it is
yeah they probably know what it is is it
good so far yes okay
the the lovely people over at strafe the
game sent out of tweets asking you
because they they have not yet hit their
Kickstarter goal but they're close how
close are they this as of this morning
they were at a hundred and twenty some
thousand and their goal is 180 yeah and
so they sent a tweet out saying hey if
any of y'all are streamers and you want
an early peek at strafe let us know and
you know like you can stream a level and
if you talk about strafe the game you
know will let you stream a level and I
was like I'm on that so I emailed them
right away yeah and and yeah they're
gonna let us they're gonna let us do it
okay so I've been playing it a little
bit and here's something you should know
rich yeah
I've been playing with a mouse shocking
I know
do you know why not have bad sport it
does not have enjoy bad sport and I do
have joy Tookie yeah and so I was
messing around joytokey but because it's
this this kind of like old-school hard
as balls first-person shooter you really
need that pinpoint accuracy
I can't wait to try so I I have been
playing strafe I am gonna stream strafe
tonight rich also has the download code
so I think we're gonna swap back and
forth like after he plays a little more
or exposed I will stop streaming I'll
start streaming and play a little bit
and then I'll stop and rich can play for
a little bit it'll be great did you
email me the download code I did email
you the download yeah when you're
playing I can install yeah so anyway
let's get back to it works must die yeah
oh wait wait one more thing one more
thing first I know one was I was Mike in
the stream tonight that's my house Mike
I don't know I I need to thank Osman Oh
No oh yay he may have saved theif three
for me did Oh always as my girl I
installed it it's it's it's working
right I I haven't been to through the
looking-glass in a while I probably
never would have found that on my own
through the looking glasses a a Looking
Glass Studios fansite and they did thief
okay
years like like a decade after the
studio closed that fansite is still
still active and the thief's fans are
still tinkering with theif and it's kind
of amazing congrates
that's great yeah but I
I guess wait til he's here but I do need
to thank Oz Mike one more time
sure oz Mike sent you all the stuff if
you're wrong right been here if you're
wrong then you just kind of a dickhead
you you would be a dickhead because then
you're thinking someone like you know Oh
a by the way it totally was I was Mike I
just checked you know I was pretty sure
was I was willing to risk thanking him
without double-checking yeah okay and
they say he's not here today but Oz Mike
we really appreciate it all right back
to orcs mm-hm
the or get up call the Orkin Man rich
Chad I gotta I gotta turn the sound down
on this game okay
yes you do
oh no everything got effed up am I still
playing Arkham Asylum I played a little
bit more most free time lately has been
spent editing not only the next prereq
but some some other some work came up
and so I haven't had a ton of time I
haven't had a ton of time to to play
more Arkham but I really did enjoy what
I did his play I was really enjoying
yeah we've seen the straight commercial
we watch it we watch it before last
Wednesday we're a physician it's great
it's exactly the commercial that
straight needed it's it's by the way
seeing that commercial convinced me to
back because I mean is great if they
knew enough to make that commercial they
know enough to make me back again just a
good commercial but that style of game
or something missing kind of with us a
classic quake quit down quick to a
better game yes
Oh it'll be around here knows that close
the fucking door
you know someone asked me on Twitter the
other day like whether or not I needed a
playable demo in order to back a game on
Kickstarter and I and I said you know no
usually for me all I need is a good
premise and some art assets you know
like tell me what the game's gonna look
like and tell me that the games in a
play line and that should be enough to
intrigue me to buy the game voice you
ogre it up oh thank you master Kenobi
Master gonna be just linked to the
straight Kickstarter and you can watch
the awesome old school 90s commercial
for straight it's great in any case I
know I know you're playing average but
yeah when when you get the mental power
what do you what do you think about like
in order for you to back a game are like
what do you need in order to back a game
premise I'm interested in a type of game
I want play
sure like I haven't actually I didn't
actually end up backing it but I would
have backed was star citizen okay
because you know I haven't played a
Space Flight cinnamon in many years
okay I would have back that just because
I want to play a space flight sim sure
like kind of game I like they won't make
any more that would probably make me
back
all right cool so that's something I've
given that much thought to it
oh no no it's just you know like someone
was was asking me specifically like do
you need a playable demo no importer
bags man
I mean it's a risk you buy you buy
anything it's a risk you buy you back a
Kickstarter there's a risk okay if
there's not a playable demo and I might
depend upon the or at least at least not
like footage of a game running in alpha
if it's like all concept I might be
reluctant unless I really trusted the
names behind it
sure sure yeah and I think that's I know
he knows how to make space flight sim so
I will I will I will I would back star
citizen sight unseen right but just just
because the person involved is saundra
yeah last wave job alright do it last
wave do it to it oh I see in that small
and fast
I've seen the jet yeah we talked about
every 90s commercial ever
and that's very funny yes
the the strafe commercial is right up
there with everything
yeah you know what for some reason Jess
inator I think is the person who sent me
that tweet about like whether I need a
demo to back a game and they're
comparing it I I think something like
Kickstarter and something like early
access even though they're similar I
feel like they're very different you
know I do not I did not I don't know why
I did not know I did throw my arms up in
the air
congratulation thank you so far i-55
start everything 5/5 skull whatever
whatever whatever your your item is your
thing you've most everything to ever I
have most everything yes I've not had
one failure of any kind okay so
everything's gonna go straight to help
know that I'm here how far are you cuz
you been streaming since like 6:00 okay
this is twenty five stages
man say doesn't say the Phoenix there
I'm sure there are spikes in this game
absolutely Jess inator you know the
difference between Kickstarter and and
early access I think more in lies in in
the what he called in the ecosystem
where it's like Kickstarter they seem to
have a bigger and this is only with
things that I've had early access to and
things that I have kick-started is I get
more regular updates with my
kick-started things then with my early
access to things where it's like even if
nothing is happening with something I've
kick-started the developers or the
creators or the whoever's are just like
here's what we've been working on here's
what we've been spending your money on
and I don't feel like there is the same
level of reporting in for early access
and so for me early access just seems
like a like a pre-sale like a like a
pre-order whereas Kickstarter does seem
like more of an investment and your
investment can fail but and these are
not scientific at all these are just my
feelings on it due to personal
experiences so if you disagree I
wholeheartedly accept that
take care of the jack oh no problem I'm
just gibbering uh someone's asking a
very important question beef ribs or
pork ribs and I you know I eat
everything
I am II and II eats everything I mean
I've had good both I've had bad both
does that count I've had both and I've
had I've had good both and bad both you
know so it's fine yeah III just yes oh
yeah I can't go I don't even know I
don't think I've ever had just beef ribs
honestly dinosaur ribs is what they're
called I've had I've had I've had I've
had baby back ribs mmm I don't think
I've had beef ribs you should you should
get your hands and some beef ribs I mean
obviously it's just one of those things
I don't think I've even had ribeye with
the bone in it what that's that would be
the part of rib yeah I've had rib eye
steak I just haven't had with a bone
like like you get on like a prime rib
roast you I mean you should do that I
enjoy meat of all kinds and flavors so
you know but you know what I don't like
barbecue sauce I do not enjoy most
barbecue sauces of course there are
exceptions but in general I don't go out
for barbecue because I dislike the sauce
yeah yeah there we go
you know what they're rich Evans and I
never agree on food mostly because of
his very real allergies but but there
you go we've got a nice spice rub
there's something like
now no spice Robert like you know just a
nice hose you just some just some grease
put some grease and some fat you know
sweet baby Ray's
right yes jack is here to shock the
stream with my with my divisive barbecue
sauce and you know you're the food
equivalent of a shock jock exactly it
could be by the way that I've only
experienced terrible barbecue sauce you
know I think I've talked about this
before and this is a very good story I
know that ahead of time for years I
convinced myself cuz I know it's not for
years I convinced myself that I didn't
like cake I went I went maybe five to
seven years without eating cake because
I had convinced myself that I just
didn't like it and as it turns out I
found out that I was just eating shit
cake all the time like in a store-bought
pancake right I have a similar story
okay I go ahead you Fischer oh well the
moral stories eventually you know like I
moved into a nice neighborhood and we
have you know bakeries and people make
stuff from scratch and and I had some
good cake and it was one of those like
this is what it's supposed to be moments
look you know you you just that you have
so much shit all the time you forget how
good you can have it you know it turns
out I just hate Boston really you hate
frosting to sickeningly sweet
nomination I don't like it so bad you
don't like to sweet mmm overly sweet
gunk someone who's a canary texture yeah
something where you get shit cake from
the the grocery store sheet cake that's
that's the kind of like shit cake I'm
talking about never had a taste for it
it doesn't taste like anything it was
like spongy you know what's my stance on
LSD try not to do it too often and make
sure to do it early in the day that's
that's something really important with
LSD yeah it's a very nice drive very
nice drive yeah I was very much
it's the most beautiful Road in the city
I'm Lakeshore Drive I'm not signed cause
LSD oh there there playing with the
double entendre drugs oh sure I'm sure
I'm sure my Oh someone's dick neutral no
significant loss no am I the the very
first time that I tried LSD tried the
very first time I did LSD we mean a
couple friends had decided we were gonna
do it and we decided pretty late in the
day and we called all of our usual drug
sources and none of them are coming
through and so then it just became one
of those things like we said we were
gonna do this we're gonna do this in
spent the entire night just trying to
find a couple hits for us all and
eventually we got ourselves the drug and
it was far too late and we had been
getting high all day and so we didn't
no worries no wait well so by the time
we had it it was like 11 o'clock at
night like 10 maybe 10 11 o'clock at
night and we've been getting high all
day and so it didn't really kick in
until like 1:00 2:00 in the morning and
it was uh I think in my limited
experience I I've done it a couple times
and had that pretty good time both times
but it was it was one of those terrible
things where it takes a while to kick in
and so like at 1:00 or 2:00 in the
morning me and my friends are sitting
around watching movies and all of a
sudden the TV screen starts moving
further away from me while the wall
stays in the same position so it's
almost like the wall is sucking in the
TV TV screen and I look over to my
friends and I'm like it's happening I
was until later I was really excited
about that fact and then and then it was
just an entire night of staying awake
all night and we would like we took
several trips out to my car we didn't
drive anywhere but yeah oh god I died
oh no I'm sorry
oh so it wasn't even like someone bested
you oh I just I just saw it I'm so sorry
oh that's a that's things extra yeah so
you know like it was just a lot of back
and forth like we go from my friends
apartment out to our car just because
like we never felt quite right we were
just on edge all night it was it was a
really fun night you know you got you
get to see amazing things and of course
you know listen if you watch movies and
every everything is is very different
brainy's is seeing things that it
shouldn't see it's all I'm gonna
describe it as wonderful just because
I've had good times I've heard stories
people who have had terrible times but I
had really good times the only problem
was so we didn't sleep all night and all
of a sudden the next day it's like 8 in
the morning and we're still away it's
like 8 in the morning and a buddy and my
a buddy of mine and I are watching
cartoons because of course and all of a
sudden we are feeling pretty good and we
say oh man I I really think if we're
coming down now it's wearing off and you
know of course we'd spent all night just
worrying about when it's gonna wear off
and so he took their little notebook and
he started writing things in the
notebook and just saying like you know
just like my name is whatever right and
I'd read it I'd say oh I understand this
perfectly we must be getting better and
we'd continue watching TV in like 20
minutes later we'd look at the notebook
and it was gobbledygook and it's just
like oh we're not getting
better and and you know then we started
to freak ourselves out like oh we're
never gonna be normal again
the first time no no overall I still
think it was good but definitely like
through the next couple of days I was
off the next couple of days my for that
for months even years afterwards I
couldn't drive too late at night because
I would see things in the shadows and it
would freak me out ya know and I did I
did years huh yes yeah the the big
culprit for me was driving at night when
I was tired and I would just see things
jump into the road and I hundred percent
contribute attribute that to to the late
nights of LSD usage I did it again after
that and we had a very good experience
just cartoons and the the second time I
did it we were a little more prepared
you know obviously had it we had it well
before him did it early enough in the
day and then we were surprised at my
house my apartment with with people
wanted to come over and hang out at my
apartment and one of my roommates said
ok without consulting me and it's like
no we were gonna stay inside and do
drugs and we've already done drugs and
then all of a sudden all these people
came over including my very recent
ex-girlfriend yeah and so I was high on
drugs and people were over which it was
a very fun experience in hindsight
but you know like it was actually a fun
game throughout the night just like do
you think anybody knows and I'm sure
they only laugh but me and my friends
who had dropped acid were just we're
just like I don't think anyone knows
what's going on even though we had like
jugs of orange juice and we're watching
The Lion King yeah apparently orange
juice intensifies though so anyway
yeah Jack's getting real tonight no you
asked a question I answered the question
I'm always real night visuals were
probably from getting a fake knot
al-aziz yeah but I got baked well before
I saw the visions the the visuals only
happened after I dropped acid and I I
was getting baked for a while like a
loop like a year year and a half before
I did that so so no the night visuals
were 100% attributed to acid and at the
time I lived far away from my friends
and so I I drove home after I was ok
even though like but I was like deathly
tired you know and that drive home is
what I think triggered it all art crime
is like Jack all I asked about was pork
ribs or beef ribs no someone else asked
about Alan's do you and I know couple
times at fun 5 times obviously it's just
like be safe you know just make sure
you're doing it with people you enjoy
and and don't plan on going anywhere
that's the real thing question for the
chat yeah if we had any subscribers I
have not heard one what the fuck is
there is there something wrong with my
sound setup or it's just been a no
subscriber night which feels fun but I
don't want to miss somebody so I I
haven't been seeing anybody okay so so
there was there was one like power
before the stream started I thanked them
in text the chat okay sherry sure thank
you so do you want my strength uh yeah
sure for sure
first I would do want to answer one
question yeah someone asked a very
important question which is what brand
of cigarette I smoked I smoked when I
smoked and it was lucky strike lucky
strike filtered it means fine tobacco
it's toasted oh and apparently Oz Mike
is here Oh
oz Mike thank you for your
information on that thief 3 mod you you
probably saved thief 3 for me I've
stalled everything and looks like it's
working and I haven't been to the the
thief forums that through the
looking-glass in a while now I I quite
possibly never would have seen this so
thank you very much putting that out ok
ok oh and I I see a future future J says
that he subscribed and nothing happened
so just in case future future J I'm
sorry but we do really appreciate it
o city and citizen cannon said yeah that
they just subbed and it's not working no
we don't we're we're not seeing any subs
right now and and we really apologize so
if you sub let us know let us know it is
ticked and it is at the top of the
priority list on the broadcaster yeah oh
and I'll like just make sure like I
don't know if anyone notices if you if
you type in the @ symbol and then
previously recorded underscore live it
shows up to us with like a highlighted
black bar and so we can see that a
little easier so I'm saying I'm sorry
about talking about tobacco it is hard
to quit I
I recommend quitting you'll feel much
better
oh it's which place Pokemon says
subscription notification is messed up
on their channel too ok it's a it's a
toy sitting tonight we really apologize
just make sure to add us and and well
thank you but so now we're gonna cut the
stream and give me like five minutes to
set up the stream on my computer
yeah and we'll be back and I'm gonna
play some motherfucking strafe it's
gonna be awesome awesome times are about
to happen

[Part IV]
dreams together to like you know Romney
from Plan B recommended we make this we
build for speedrunning and I was like
that's a great idea so Stephen jumped to
it he lost like three nights of sleep
and I'm and Valentine's Day to get it up
so we've been putting it out there you
can get out there as a game show and the
only thing I wasn't also don't care you
know what that means because a lot of
triple-a developers and releasing betas
just as demos nowadays so you know when
we say hey you know it's pre-alpha like
nothing is in yet nothing's locked like
we're not even
this isn't even a finished vertical
slice like our systems work our
procedural generation works to a point
our Gib system is mostly implemented but
we have still a lot more plans for it
you know to just give that to someone
who might not get a document that
explains that and then say oh this game
sucks you know why are they trying to
raise money for this it's terrifying I
don't know how the sound is going to be
but well and rich remember if you if you
right click on your little beat because
you can't adjust the the sound in-game
yet yeah so you might have to
right-click on your speaker icon in the
lower right hand corner of your computer
and open up your open up your mixer it's
not a thing it's it's a thing or so I
like regular click on that little
speaker very interesting I did not know
you could okay
whoa you learned some new every day and
by the way i I run a Mac computer
turning you back up and I know I know
more about the Windows operating system
I've never
to have two audios going at different
levels before that's so that so that's
how you mix the audio right there
alright see if I can get used to doing
this upside down bizarre world where
down is up and up is down
I like it I'm handling that okay so far
I mean it looks like you are I'm going
it was what is this guy with this head
ripped open and his guts hanging out I
love him oh that's one of the cosmonauts
like one of the okay we have three other
enemies that aren't implemented in this
right now we have one it's him gain he's
just not fun yet and so I'm the hives
that are on the wall those are gonna
spawn one of two enemies that's what you
seem a little bright that came out in
those fly around and then we have blood
bags which are kind of like kind of the
head fatty type enemies that come out
now you know when you blow them up it's
just like big pools of blood and um so
then we have the people from Icarus the
crew the ship they're kind of like these
infected people that kind of cling to
walls and ceilings gonna try to get the
drop at you and you know kind of leap at
you and the last ones are these lies
that are probably about four to five
feet tall there's about as big as a
glutton and they'll just kind of be like
a stalker or turret will sit in the back
and we'll just shoot acid from the
difference so we think that whoa
oh man I love it though the more you
talk about this the more I get excited
about a game like this just be and and I
don't know what if it's if it's 100
percent nostalgia but it's like the
amount of pixelated gore just makes me
an amount of happy that I can't properly
express in the stream just want I see I
see all of the neon blood all over the
floor and if we accidentally blew myself
up trying to grab smells
yay yes so with the other enemy is
dumping into the mix will most likely
have it so that it's not just gonna be a
full room of all that was great just got
to the bar you blew yourself up all
right what are we getting rid of those
start your own enter hell
l2 restart ok I told you the wrong thing
I was just going off of the email you
guys think I'm making this game side by
the way we would have no idea if this is
really the best scam ever yeah the
stupidest game ever all this stuff
alright I can't look up or down properly
yet I picked the sniper rifle I wasn't
tell you what does that tell you about
my intelligence and so rich when you get
to like the health station or if you
want to pick up barrels it's e
quick heads up now we all wait to see
how much you got the weird thing for
Taemin eyes we'll hear it first before
we see oh I don't even know it's gonna
shoot a barrel behind him
oh that makes sense I like program to
shoot at the barrels no it's just a
sense you know they have the projectile
if you're standing in front of it at any
point when you strafe around a different
direction that thing is going to hit the
barrel at some point okay okay great
shotguns probably a better choice for me
right now we're going shotgun here's the
thing I think you might want to go
machine gun yeah
machine guns good accessible first
weapon all right try trying everything
okay
I did I did machine gun than I did the
sniper now I'm doing check
yeah I think the secondary definitely is
changed on the shotgun but good enough
time to implement it for these flavors
and so like right now the secondary is
more of a spread shot it's it's pretty
much a straight horizontal line okay so
and it has I forget what it's called but
basically it penetrates the enemy and
can go through to another oh you can
actually kill lines of enemies with it
oh look yeah I think Aflac like grenade
will just feel a lot better it's I mean
definitely because the other two weapons
you know the machine gun you get the
grenade and with the railgun you get
like a railgun grenade you know not
having a grenade with a shotgun was the
first thing that threw me so you think
so yeah I think you are correct just
having kind of more similarly styled
secondary weapons yeah and like once you
get this the kind of rare powerup before
these guns those secondaries change even
your primary changes they become more
wild
oh god oh god oh god you making that
noise bridge what was that was me I
think my comment went oh no I think
there's so much adrenaline pumping
through my like my head right now after
watching someone play our game it's like
oh god how's it gonna break now how's it
gonna break
I only you know what I but I got out I
got stuck in that I got stuck above the
lift for a little bit but I got out I
guess I should start reading the stream
- you're right Lloyd beets
it is so tight it's so bad audience
questions right now I'm dying horribly
that's another good thing to know is
like the gun spinning around all stuff
that's just stuff we haven't worked on
yet like right now it's the gun movement
like when you run is on Springs that
that doesn't affect where it's shooting
it's just an aesthetic choice but yeah I
don't like that we step on acid it like
rolls around and stuff yeah all
perfectly acceptable for pre-alpha man
this behind-the-scenes footage sure
doesn't look like the movie basically
what it roll
remember that was a big leap but add
like really bad effect in when I got
lead vacantly don't even remember never
big x-men fan Wolverines not something I
paid much attention to industry because
you don't know if the box office sucked
because the movie or because it was
leaked in its rough form hey I got to
imagine if it was a good movie fans
would want to see it on the big screen
anyway sure but but for like the people
who produce to that movie they can spin
that it performed before it messes up
the analytics it performed poorly
because it fully even though it was
going poorly because they would be self
doing a bit better this time thank you
the kiss that was the kiss of death
that's what that was so I had a hive of
Lucky hot and that smoke plume to the
right and it was like a real dirty trick
I was looking forward to it but
apparently it was was too annoying so we
cut it yeah that would be a little that
would be a bit much
now that you say it I want that's what
that's one of those things where I would
love to see another player come across
something like that and laugh at them
but if it happened to me I'd be really
pissed if you hear Romero talk about
like when he was making doom quake and
his decisions going into the levels I
mean that's something I hunt down a lot
because you know hearing people that are
big influences talk about their process
it helps me design when you're working
on yeah he doesn't really like to fuck
with players it sounded like and it's
pretty fun I think you find we find some
interesting like emergent gameplay
through things like that with the
procedural element of the beautiful
things when you get when you get trapped
in spelunky or when you get a shit item
in Isaac and you can say well this is a
shit run I know I'm probably not going
to I know I'm probably not gonna win
let's just see what fun I can have what
the items are with the room layout in it
and then it just helps you understand
the game overall what I find interesting
is spelunky and Binding of Isaac are
very different in the way they approach
procedural content from a gameplay
stance so spelunky kind of has misses a
binary upgrade system where you have
your raw spelunker and then you have you
know your spring boots that now just you
jump a fixed type where as binding of
issac you know there is no jumping but
everything is kind of upping points and
stats so kind of
combinations now I think that's would
make some binding of issac runs suck
it's just the idea that oh shit I got
like five power-ups I don't like in a
row and then you just kind of throw it
away
Marius was spunky I mean unless you're
going for the shotgun jetpack combo and
you're just like won't take anything
else you can always enjoy your time with
it and I think that's the offensive
brilliance that like Derrick you brought
to it and I want to try our hardest to
make sure that you don't have a bad run
you're not like ten minutes fifteen
twenty minutes in and go this let's
restart you know and dark levels do that
for me it's full-on heat I just ducked
so it's like I'll do a hell run like
probably every other day because I've
just been playing it for two years that
now when I just reach a dark level if
I'm like below a certain point of health
or not
fuck this and I just respawn oh cool
what's just about procedural elements
I'm gonna link to a post on our dev blog
just to explain some of it so we we have
some stuff explaining the music from 43
we have some stuff I put up a post about
level generation just kind of quickly
explaining how approaching it and then
even there's the jib system it's called
uber Gore Tech that's something that
right now we're gonna add a lot more
superfluous elements to it that are just
stupid fun I think that's that's that's
hearing that from a developer you know
as as a consumer it's hard like I don't
understand these things like like the
actual math behind making a game so
hearing from a developer these kind of
things I think is one fascinating and
really helpful to a consumer standpoint
like knowing that you are thinking about
making your game as accessible as
possible while still making it
challenging that has to be the hardest
balancing act yeah like it's it's
something that Steve and I we have
similar tastes with the game and you
know what we like and also our
influences and they've set a very good
foundation for you know what feels good
and what is accessible and what is just
ridiculous but at the same time I do
love the way the community bands
together to just talk about secrets and
reveal things that's one of the reasons
I'm not a fan of early access for this
is because it doesn't lend itself to
that it's it's very much a when it comes
out it's gonna be dense with things to
discover if we're slowly putting those
things in throughout development it's
gonna take the piss out of a live
discovery so under pen you know I'm
gonna be cool we have a lot of cool
things planned what do you do I don't
know I got caught in the lift what do
you lose five minutes ago
basically the way the blood mapping
works right now which is really
interesting it's I died hey I got I got
that spot faster than you did Jack
alright and I'm playing I'm playing with
my controls upside down I'm I'm playing
this game on my head Jack you are much
better game you're gonna get it rich is
gonna do it I'm so eager to see you guys
here we go
here we go you can do this I believe in
you oh but I can and I won't right now
you probably won't be able to see
because of where we're at and
development I don't care anything that's
not just a community texture it will not
map properly at this point so that's why
you're probably on the lift
I'm standing right in front that
exploding barrel the probably was not
smart no I did shoot a jellyfish there
was screaming right at me though don't
get too close jelly yeah well okay
the poncho or the the rain-slicked or
something where when you shoot a jelly
and it's coming right at you it won't
hurt you but you still stepping on it
will mess you up
I think I'm fucked I'm fucked I'm good
I'm good night again I died it happened
I got it over with we're done we're down
to my dead yeah grenades don't forget
about your grenades yes I suppose that's
right I have not been using the
secondary fire March not as much as I
should have
that was my go-to strategy with that
hive it's just grenaded before it
becomes a problem I think if you um if
your realness if you really want to be
in the speed zone you kind of just spam
the secondary for most of this is it in
for an ammo um up I mean yeah we set
everything to be ludicrously high okay
I'm gonna spam me a lot of grenades then
you'll have to read I think it takes 15
bullets out of your 75 so you maybe get
four clip
that's fine you only get four grenades
this just turned into a whole new game
for
and but I own this on our sure
I can't imagine playing any games on LSB
that sounds dangerous
right especially this the colors
fast-moving it's so realistic you like
lose yourself and what is real life and
works great
absolutely well the graphics are so
realistic I'm at that point already I
got I got a frantic text from rich
earlier said you know wondering if I was
okay or if I was caught on an alien
spaceship I just had to dumb no no the
game is that is that hyper realistic I
thought we were watching James Cameron's
aliens I didn't know this was my game I
thought I was watching James Cameron's
the abyss the abyss sanic the abyss
Anacapa theory wouldn't really puff to
touch what doom exists without James
Cameron's aliens it would have just have
taken a different form huh
I think it would've taken a different
form I mean you see Carmack pushing the
envelope with engines at the time yeah
you know even with like wolf3d
I think the progression after that would
have been
what does make them bow game or
something like that you know they're
popular at the time yeah but you know
cuz a quake is you know has the six
degrees of freedom like you actually
have mouse controls it's a much more
modern game but as far as the setting
goes dude is just by far just so much
cooler than plays in my opinion yeah
it's all cyber tech sci-fi
demons portals it's fucking awesome so
I'm kind of okay with the the quake to
those settings the the the strogg
they're kind of like the heavy metal
board I mean I'm just saying like as far
as setting those they nailed it yeah
those you mix you miss you mix pace with
with demons and it was pretty unique at
the time I think that's I think that's
great in any sitting just because I'm I
like sci-fi space anything space
vampires play human stage space truckers
space dicks like disregard that last one
my health is low my health is low we'll
see
or you can either way I don't know like
a kilt I had killed by enemy fire I'm
sorry I don't know if that was like
confusing oh my god you should have
explained that earlier why wasn't that
in the release notes wait I don't even
hit the enemy with power-ups I'm gonna
do this it's gonna happen it's gonna
happen you gotta use the leech strats
alright so the percentage that's enemies
killed I'm assuming your name sweet Jim
how did the game know new record Jim
wait someone is quoting something from
us is the making of doom began after the
release of spear of destiny in mid
September 1992 the initial idea was to
make a movie license based on aliens I
just started reading that and got very
far into it I I would recommend it if
you like biography if you like like me
they're the rockstars of gaming you know
that in 95 there are more copies than
doom installed on PCs in Windows 95 like
that's an awesome statistic hmm so I
remember greatly anticipating doom I was
a fan of Wolfenstein well that's great
I'm watching a turret shoot a glutton in
the face as its eating your core yeah I
didn't do so hot that last run that's
good that's gonna happen I mean the
speed zone toughen you man just too fast
I just every time I see that like that
melts dissolve into the game it makes my
heart sing for finals I mean one
question for you
how many star wipes will be in this game
premiere we're gonna have venetian
blinds pop apply 3d cube spin I didn't
know I didn't know and I'm sorry
look at that yeah I'm just one scene
that has it has baked me religious
themes I'm gonna do a cross wipe but not
nice not a hand you win an Oscar for
anything for a video because if you can
do
fade to black and gunshot I want to make
the respawn animation like when you
press it just undo this face okay that
would be the most amazing thing ever I I
have no control over it but I fully
support the idea I think they do that in
GTA 4 on her 5 on the online I believe I
think I was watching some videos cuz I
have only played a single-player for
that but yeah if you decide kill your
stuff I think he doesn't look gun on
himself
great this this is the run and then the
end of the game you beat the end of the
game and it turns out it was all a dream
and then the phone rings find out you
were actually fighting yourself and your
inner demons oh my god and it's a 12
year snake
but this this is the run you've heard of
this this brilliant piece of filming
oh shit I'm out of bullets okay
but it's called spoiler it took 12 years
to get over here that means it's
automatically good time equals great
which is why do puke and forever is the
best game I've ever seen
haha hundred percent one hundred and ten
percent
like how fucking daring is that to be
like you know what I choose this kid and
regardless how good imagine how hard it
is to find a kid that can act there's no
guarantee he'll be able to act in 12
years this is why most filmmakers might
you know just cast kids of different
ages that look kind of similar you know
and use the magic of filmmaking how do
you make a puppet aged 12 years glue
glue some facial hair on it movie magic
movie better answer I'm sorry about that
I've got it now I have mastered your
game alright good
I like fully mastered the game okay how
have you fully mastered the game what
have you done I'm gonna beat your ass
that's what I've done well it's gonna
it's gonna happen
give me give me your stress it's gonna
hit my stratts is to not die and to do
better than you did that's that's my
stratts no doesn't help you I'm trying
to beat you I'm trying to unhook you
apparently you're stuck in an elevator
yeah you have to look at the ground and
press e on these okay so we might do it
so you just look at the wall and press
it or just do it doom timer where they
just go up automatically but I mean
punching other people play it it's it's
it's good to see this because now I
understand that everyone doesn't think
yeah honestly I would not have thought
of that hippie on the ground
oh shit
I figured out that you look at the floor
and press the e button though to be fair
I didn't figure out that it wasn't a
ladder in the first place
yes about it too much stress about in
half way look I gotta tell you don't
worry about the Alpha because even
looking at the game paper play footage
before I played it it looks great this
looked like a fun game I I wish I had
the inverted look but otherwise very fun
very fun I figured you know you know
what I really hate
finding keys playing what finding keys I
want somebody to tell me what keys I'm
supposed to use old-school shooter with
a controller can't die now go to it I
think like you know the obvious question
is you know how many cutscenes and
you're basically playing a cutscene
right now this is probably all of the
game around all the FMV we're shooting
we're gonna have real scenes and I think
I'm out of ideas now also the real game
is just a series of FMV sequences oh I
was hoping a lot of different keys it's
too confusing let's just keep this one
key you press it any time you know and
it'll just pull off the next video
die motherfucker die die motherfucker
die and hurt for you guys in the chat
yes I use a controller but we're not
bringing that up right now you might
want to have something you can hold so
you don't have to keep like meatball in
your keyboard looking for WASD no and
and before you know I we I got this this
afternoon and and well before the stream
hey I did my joy to keybinding because I
am a controller player and it wasn't
working
it wasn't precise and up which I know
about controllers but in most modern
games I the way the game plays a block
system or something like that which is
you know I don't want to change the
gameplay experience or controller so
that's something we're gonna deal with
last fuck yeah but cuz you know how many
for me at least as a fan of old school
shooters like when I would hear the
developer say you know coming to
consoles and they want to make it
accessible like for the controllers it
just pretty much means you're no longer
making an old school shooter so I really
want to be sure we knock that out first
and then make it a good experience for
people who may not be able to play with
the mouse and keyboard I'm just glad you
have your priorities straight know and
by the way this playing this demo has
forced me for the first time in a long
time to play with a mouse and a keyboard
and I loved it
and for most modern games I don't have
to worry about that tip it's just easier
than me to pick up a controller and map
the controls oh my god are you doing it
boom headshot yeah I'm doing it yeah I
agree I think you know sometimes just a
matter of convenience but I think if
we're gonna pay Amash to something we're
willing to do right yeah with the
exception of making everything
technically 1996 it's an O Maj it's not
a it's not a fire roll everything
steppin I've never been so excited I am
the winner Jack did you do it
wait I gotta figure out where to go oh
no the door you come into you're
basically facing oh I think I see no
yeah yeah
but you're only at 89% another guy I
can't tell how I did it I did it through
I could kill the other guy there you go
I'm making my own sound effects now oh
shit oh shit oh shit oh shit I got hit
in the head by something concentration
must happen um okay
Ritchie's not gonna talk to them
independence regardless of how long it
takes yeah my heart my heart's pumping
my heart's pumping yeah I could no sure
tops door the door is opening it's gonna
happen and I'm the spark actually shoots
out the second you can fit through the
door Oh
if you kite the enemies to the end and
you're just like fuck it I'm just
running to the end you have to fight
them off at this point and then if you
can the spark fly over your back you're
like you know you're able to cut through
I've done it and it blocks your time
sweep 11 minutes and 54 seconds I mean
terrible oh yeah what's the wait what
you said to do what I did it great stir
is no longer stir stir even in could
blazer right on them
just a little bit after them you're fine
right if I were using a shotgun that
would have been respectable yeah stirs a
professional we can we can't match
we can't Magister so now that you beat
at once you think you can get that time
oh god no once you get inverter controls
Rich's on topic yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I'll be a lot better once up is up again
this this is the pneumatic tube it'll
shoot down and yeah that's will transfer
to the next level yes assume that would
be no what do we do with a shotgun
shotgun okay do it play shotgun now play
it play it what time is it 11:00 I might
get another beer while you go from get a
shotgun
I hear that makes you play better a
hundred well I'm not playing anymore so
I don't have to worry about it those
times
did you enter the the prereq name
properly the same light or are you I
might be playing as Jimmy sweet pants
little Detroit if you get tab weight
shooting things now there goes man there
goes my speedrun think I just killed my
speedrun act like we have an on kind of
untested smack build I was just playing
and any time I pick up a barrel of my
gun wouldn't come back
yeah for those who are asking to be very
important question of what view I'm
drinking tonight I'm drinking a skull
pan IPA San Diego brewed sculpin it has
a fish on it it's delicious
you know now that I've dinner was I
actually I'm doing a lot better him here
I'm linking to his beer there you go oh
yeah you can click that to donate yep
donate to the beer that I'm drinking the
beer it's you know she's kicked out of
the doctor don't want just it or if you
google strafe and Kickstarter that'll
take you right to the beer that I'm
drinking and they'll ship it right
through your house don't tell your mom
if you if you pay fifteen twenty dollars
or more you'll get that beer guarantee
I'm actually kind of liking the shotgun
secondary yeah alright it feel that you
know sound effect wise why not it feels
too much like a regular shot yeah we
were between a few different ideas
I definitely needs to be really eventful
it I could see where it might be a
little bit too similar but I've I've
been having luck with it so far I've
used it a lot have visual things we can
do you know but I find that when you
have like a very simple idea coded and
even if it doesn't have a flourish is
that the sound effect and the graphics
and if it feels good it only gets better
so this is like yeah but I'm wondering
if the I'm kind of the cluster for the
laughs grenade will feel really good and
then we can add things to it like steam
or you know flame coming out of the
barrel stuff like that will feel really
cool yep
any particular films influencing future
levels of the game hmm fifty fifty
Shades of Grey Chariots of Fire yeah I'm
drumline I think and then you might want
to stay away from Schindler's List does
that one take 12 years to complete yeah
this game the actual the graphics page
so so in 12 years
we'll see what what a game looks like
nowadays but twelve years from now and
it'll still be retro we just end up with
Unreal 3 and it doesn't change because
of how long the last console cycle ran
so I guess it wouldn't be that
interesting but it would be it would be
automatically appropriate so oh yeah and
because of that it'll win a ton of
awards oh everyone I love it
I'm liking it
I'm liking it you can say that you just
like because the star wipes whoa
yeah no rich those are fake doors don't
get it don't big prick you reckon your
speed run times textures
you have to you have to at least beat 7
minutes and then you get on the board
you gotta get you in the room someone
asked it I'm releasing the game in in
style chapters we are going to release a
shareware version first really well once
again being first-time devs we want to
make sure that people have means to
trust the game will be good and you know
that's kind of like our commitment to
the old style game so we don't know how
big that's gonna be yet but it's
definitely gonna be a decent demo where
you can experience it and get your
building amazing
it's it's almost as if you understand
what people are looking for apparently
not our fans are the worst people they
they're they're just awful just you know
this is this whole campaign every every
direction it's just it's been very
entertaining very interesting very
terrifying
you found the secret glutton yep we put
them there as a secret that's not what
Jack what throws the barrel or I guess
the Devon Tom what throws the barrel
what key yeah he picks it up and then
just click the fire remember remember
I'm a speedrun her answer that question
quicker oh no oh no it didn't working
out at all
oh no I I think I hit the glutton that
was in front of me with it when I was
aiming for the the jelly-fish maker yeah
I did there's like a piece of ham there
that he's eaten that's pretty cool I
could beat that seven minute time I'm
gonna do it it's good I saw someone in
the chat to give an appropriate comment
which is the someone who has actually
you know what with the game someone who
has a problem with the game yeah is more
likely to give feedback than the person
who enjoys it we like feedback we don't
like dicks like this like there's
there's people who you know brought up
issues with the HUD and the gun being
too large like because if this was a
traditional FPS you know it's I
understand that and that's why we're
gonna have sliders for you to control it
but you see people saying hey that takes
up a lot of space maybe you should
consider you know putting in some demos
sorry some options and then other people
are just like that's taking up 80% of
the screen what the fuck are you
thinking so
sure so if you have feedback find a way
to find a way to give that
constructively or at least politely
yeah I mean we're totally down to listen
Google people you know we like to listen
to people who are talking up like people
not just attacking us or trying to make
something we love first of all how dare
you try to bring joy to my life
you goddamn monster every time
yeah we'll get a good graphic slider and
turn it up
actually um you can turn it all the way
up to 1994 we'll have a gender slider
gender slider I'm not even joking like
lana wachowski it'll just the boys like
it I do think that should be in every
game where it's like that's simple
enough it's like you do know like
especially for like a lot of 2d games
again like spelunky you know it's just a
sprite different sprite model where you
could be you could be a chubby asian kid
you could be a lady I do love that kid
it's never a bad idea
it's any any time you feel like it's a
bad idea you're wrong
playing funky as always the right I just
haven't gotten it yet been like years
right oh absolutely
no and then you know then you get all
the achievements and I love all the
achievements because that
ah you get the bigger challenge that's
something we would that's something we
wanted to look into it because like once
again like multiplayer trying to create
an arena shooter or anything like that
with a small team like ours like their
quake live is free why aren't people
playing that if they're looking for a
good arena shooter you know like we
would just be emulating that to some
degree so co-op makes more sense if we
were to go down that road because it's
still our game little Detroit okay and
then but at the same time something like
a daily challenge where we can walk the
seed in the different assets and have
people compete for leaderboards kind of
like you guys are doing right now for
those hot times that's that's something
I can see being within range of our team
and you know giving people something to
do beyond the game so I really got a lot
out of things below me so I'm hoping so
yeah that secondary is pretty fun to
watch
great Robert Bazaar John probably whose
eyes are saying he just got spelunky
because of how much I talk about it and
he's enjoying it but it's hard as fuck
absolutely that's what makes it fun
have you noticed how I don't say it like
unapproachable on face for most people
because it doesn't reveal itself to you
it's an acquired taste like coffee or
something like that because you start
with it you don't really see what it's
all about until you get into the new
walks or find the secret sir really dig
into it and they're just this like fine
craft and you can appreciate today they
like the variety the love and the
balanced look to put into that hand no
you know what it was for me was sparking
my initial hesitation was 100% art style
I I looking at that art style I was
expecting kitty-kitty yep but it's like
smiling and holding your hand that's a
really good way to put it
absolutely and so once you realize it's
hard as balls then it's a
yeah but yeah I completely agree like
its I knew spelunky from the freeware
version before it can't but I have
completed so I heard you know like a lot
of fanfare for a lot of people loved it
but I didn't know why so I just kind of
got it got cred in my book I was like
okay yeah I'll definitely get it and
once it came out for XBLA was when I
decided just to grab it because a few
friends recommended it and I'm yeah I
wasn't I wasn't expecting that
yeah it exceeded my expectation and you
know it's it's something I like after
your your 40th death and then you start
to understand that that every single
death is your fault and that's a hard
thing for I think a lot of modern gamers
to understand even bear or it's like no
no no the game didn't fuck up the game
isn't too hard I'm just not doing this
level chloric correctly it's like I
fucked up I need to get better and then
you get your first and olmec win and it
might be a cheap one and that kind of
victory is so hard to come by
it's still hard to do normally I mean
it's like if you don't Rob the black
market and just blow out that hole for
him to fall right into it's I still
can't beat him without bombs Oh out like
once in a while but most the time I'll
end up getting stuck between a wall and
just squash when he's up when we're like
almost toward the lava and I can't fight
the shopkeepers I for some reason can
make it through the crocodile brain to
fight the shopkeepers and so I always
have to beat Olmec naturally you know
with just dodging mute the music it
helps a lot because that music is so
terrifying once they get out though
maybe that's it like it puts you in a
state of panic
like soon maybe that's it but like oh
these are just robot old men they're
cool I can feel them free open and feel
free to do you feel good evening
it's truly terrifying and for those of
you who don't know yeah I know everyone
I got about three minutes to go
I think the chat that's mad again I
don't know why they're always mad yeah
that's always something we didn't do
this right we didn't do that right it's
fine it's fine
no I see someone's saying how do you
give constructive criticism if you think
something has fundamental problems well
and it's like it doesn't need to be
constructive why would you want to get
constructive criticism if you already
don't like liked about three or it's
just like there's other things to worry
about in life one very true you could
just turn it off and leave it alone
or you could give criticism but be
polite about it yeah you know these are
the things I don't like and these are
why I don't like them thank you for your
time and listening as an example I mean
and then you could always wait for the
game to be released and then just you
know make an incredible dissection of
why it's so shit those are always fun to
run absolutely I'm not so but but you
know waiting until it's released and say
not basing your opinions on a pre-alpha
bill would be helpful right there
and I say I keep looking at chat every
once in a while it's really hard to keep
up with present moves so quickly but and
I say the game is more post-death than
the enemy animations yes that's
something we really want to we're gonna
tie a lot of things to percentages so
that you'll get maybe like custom
animations every once in a while they'll
get Billa Easter eggs here and there
actually I think yeah I think the game
just recently did that which is um the
hardline battlefield hardline they put
into financier animations stuff like
that
so definitely enjoy that kind of stuff
if this demo or broke like no this is
this is a lock see so no this is pretty
much to stay a level that you can
memorize you won't be able to do that in
a pro game guys turn this into a Q&A;
I'll stop no no no I was glad you are
here this is interesting we don't get to
do a Q&A; with Deb's yeah that might have
been a joke because there and and this
is something you can weigh in on as as
you are making a roguelike is there is a
grand internet debate as what can be
called a roguelike lights will let all
those annoying terms but everyone loves
to make fun of and it's you know I can
understand the hate because it's popular
but as someone who has sunk so much time
into spelunky Binding of Isaac there's
an extra day into like these you know
some of those games aren't perfect but I
really enjoy them and they take what I
think is kind of a
I compared them to multiplayer in regard
that you can jump in and enjoy them for
small bursts so for long periods of time
and it's not based on memorization you
know there's there's freshness to it
every time so I think there's there's a
reason that popular right now and
especially something like this where if
you love the fast offensive gameplay
offensive not offensive can it be both I
guess yeah it does kind of work you know
it's a waiting for us to give it to you
and you can play it on the plane you can
play it without an internet connection
you know and not have to even jump into
some type of a multiplayer game just get
owned if you don't have people who look
at your skill level agreed I have a lot
of opinions about this first of all how
dare you have opinions even though you
made something how dare you give your
opinions on the food you make and why
you made it
I'm showing this game for the developers
and pixel Titans yes I mean all that
blood spray is so magic though right
big bathing in it big rectangles of
blood blood orgy but you're by yourself
so I don't think that works but that's
what Phillip sport will figure
nds Robert was our job the next episode
of previously reported is being edited
now our big episode on button prompts
and why they're ruining games button
prompts and cutscenes and why they're
terrible and retro shooters are big
episode on retro shooters you can see
our new episode at kickstarter.com slash
strafe
tom is our guest he may shell as much as
he likes
don't worry guys they're not having me
back
your life will be back to normal soon
it's no if you know it's normally just
talk about cramp I mean at this point in
this room usually we're talking about
like Howard the Duck or Star Wars which
we could talk about if you're interested
yeah what a rare opportunity we get to
talk to someone who is making a game and
you know as critics we never get this
opportunity and so it's like fuck it you
know I don't understand if people are so
I don't think they are upset they might
be trying to be funny I am so fucked
right now so fun say buddy oh fuck hey
yeah I know
oh no we have shock m'as he was going to
die in the trash it's as a metaphor for
his life this is artistic I love it that
burner hurts I'll do like a director's
commentary on our game if it were a
metaphor for my life I'd be living in
that garbage for another 50 years
guys now I need to hide behind I would I
would like a minute and just and then
mysteriously disconnected from the
internet
Oh internet connection got bad don't
know what happened and I'm still skyping
with you guys so I don't know that's
really really weird okay hold on I said
I was gonna get in a new beer like five
minutes ago
I'll be right
the bonus level like that can stay in
touch I don't know if he's saying you
should have one or he knows we do have
one but we have one it's due to
references it's fine
pork ribs or beef ribs inside like
pulled pork
I really can't tell the difference right
now I have to pretend they're moving
something they're asking you about rim
son dua plans perfect Kickstarter
unfortunately fails it will not fail
because people are parlor and they're
gonna come through in the last minute
nonetheless theater mone really fucked
it up drill you're a lot closer than you
were when I first heard about the game
like few days ago I was at 83,000 right
I heard your ad what he had on 120 130
oh okay
okay yeah let me pull up this leg boom
that's weird I just clicked on that link
you posted it and it took me through
this really awesome looking game I did I
did yeah how much string it's 130 mm
pretty baller but today has been a
struggle we're hoping that we have some
youtubers that are releasing their play
through the game tomorrow we're hoping
more people will stream tomorrow and I'm
I'm in the middle of a another editing
job just because even though we have a
Kickstarter with a lot of money attached
to it I'm really broke until like that
either comes through or I you know go
back to doing this part-time and start
picking up more video work so what so
what happens if you don't make the
Kickstarter we're gonna make the kids
there but if we so deep if we don't I
think we've had a lot of people
approached us with
instead of investor opportunity yeah you
know different different publishers you
know the the attention we got in the
first few days the campaign have brought
a lot of legitimacy to to the product
but I don't like those options I've kind
of been open about that because
Kickstarter allows us to make a game
then we want to make without having to
take input from a publisher you know at
that point it's not building a game for
us in the fans
I'd rather then the people who are like
you know look at this look at this and
and give us great feedback then saying
oh hey this needs to be done by this
point and I'm like Baiju we need to have
these levels done and if they just
aren't feeling right yet I don't want to
be determined by the bottom line I want
to be like this should give you my motor
broke that's a good game that's delay
it'll be good eventually but a bad game
will throw it bad forever something like
that I'm careful so yeah you know once
again you know we don't have the trust
of everyone then we're trying our best
to be right by people you know like
really hooking them up with some some
you know showing this off and giving
away some of the music and giving a free
build out once you know polished and
playable so hopefully people stick
around and support that
rich someone's giving their score they
say someone one of our one of our
Watchers just beat shotgun at five
minutes 20 seconds oh you motherfucker
and so now that's the that's the time
you need to be just to get on the
leaderboard oh yes all with big the
pinnacle of shooters that's pretty much
what we targeted when it comes do
Cleveland forever that is we do expect
to take 7 to 13 years to make this
because once again time is what makes
things good as we've discussed ad
nauseam McCoy her i've actually
programmed every enemy in the games of
age in real time so you can sit for 12
years and watch the button gray and
wrinkled you can watch them develop
relationships some of them will get
married you can attend their weddings
they are self-conscious physically so
you'll notice something eating disorders
you know some develop crushes what what
kind of like intense dialogue trees will
you implement so like we could try to
befriend them in order to get invited to
these weddings well right now that's
only implemented for the sexual
relationships oh so we're trying to make
a dating sim along with the shooter so
but it takes like real time to develop
so if you press PI will bring up your
smartphone and there's like an in-game
tinder
where you can rate the different enemies
and you know if you're lucky enough if
you put your stats into charisma and
your your swole what we call it is a
slider for school
yeah yeah so you get maximum gains yeah
that's when you um then hook up with a
glut and a stalker
love bad I think the reason I'm enjoying
the absurdity of this so much is you
know this conversation has taken place
at a triple-a developer so someone
talking about how can we incorporate
hinder into our first-person shooter
that was really a thing like immigrated
into that yeah I mean I don't know just
think of awesome experiences steroid
boom it keeps going through the floor
right picking those up know the pickups
keep disappearing
yeah you just kind of have to walk near
the box and yeah you'll get it
eventually
yeah
you know you know what you have right so
far you point your gun at a thing you
want to die and it dies yeah the food
comes out the tip and you're overfeeding
all the enemies it's that's why it's
rated on everyone oh so it's like a
nature like a nature documentary in real
time I am this depends on getting funded
or not but we've already problem solved
one of my favorite I'm just gonna tease
a secret here Oh No
which is if you decide there's gonna be
an option to turn you off it won't
really turn it off but but awesome stuff
will happen that gives me very excited
where they'll be rocket jumping that
that area right there is very tough with
the shotgun oh the high yeah I can't get
close to it before it spawns don't
believe in yourself ton of jellyfish I
think I just got a sprint for next time
that's a better plan
that's a better plan than believing in
yourself I don't believe myself I fell
too often in life to believe in myself
well that's why you have to put your
experience points into your confidence
meter I'm bugged I don't have that I'd
like to go on a blend Oh 75 thank you
for subscribing we very much appreciated
been with us the past four months map
window what I do like is when I was
playing the game just in case I did
phenomenally well I was putting in
prereq as the names
the name of the show would be on the
leaderboard rich he just put rich and
that's fine you know it's not a big deal
jack next time I'll be prereq okay will
that make you happy I just I thought it
was funny not saying that I was gonna do
well or anything if I walked about
if you watch this in full-screen I start
pressing R for you I like to reload when
you're down right now hey I reload a lot
yeah you can see on the side of the gun
there's um there's four that's something
you have to adjust my positioning and
such but there's a screen on the side
that actually has four bars that
disappear as we shoot oh that's great
let's see when he stops yeah the blue
the blue glow is oh yeah yeah railgun it
has the loading bar and um you know
we're still locking down all the exact
behaviors or everything oh sure
you know I really like the it was a very
subtle very simple loading animation for
the railgun so I was looking for that
with the shotgun earlier I just figured
I might have been too dumb to see it so
now it's just our positioning like when
we when we started the game we were
still I was determined to make the HUD
just the bar on the bottom doing style
but here the about wouldn't let me do
that so we're probably gonna have to
hide put the new face in the menu like
if you look down into the right I'll
have you up to have your face down there
I got barreled yeah I'm here to see this
one but because the HUD is an issue for
some people
I think that's an excuse for me to make
him make the the doom bar at the bottom
for as an option I love this helmet hug
though I really do love it oh it's
beautiful
people hate heads-up displays these days
and I don't get it there's valuable
information on our heads up display
mm-hmm
no we just played Metroid Prime last
week and so like this is very
reminiscent you know like having having
those helmet details in there it's
beautiful I agree yeah like if you see
the doc okay so what you're seeing is on
the left is of course health and and
ammo armor on the right is you're gonna
this with your scrap and your credits
but to the left of that will actually be
a you'll be able to see where your ammo
is at on your heads-up display so that
will animate it won't just be static
like that oh did you change your name or
you speed Rick right now um free Rick
oh shit not for long though not for very
long
yeah I mean strength is too dangerous
the game to place without a helmet on so
it's a good excuse to have his done in a
perfect world you would have a USB
peripheral where we could put on our own
helmets
there are helmet laws in California so
you know we have to build that into the
game sure sure sure and so you have to
it has to be a helmet and it also has to
be somewhat re renewable energy powered
in order to get that tax credit I'm
gonna give it a certification yeah so
it'll be a helmet and you'll also
include bicycle pedals that you will
have to pedal while playing the game to
power the helmet it's it's very future
technology it's great healthy lifestyles
yeah I'm actually getting used to the
controls now baby non-inverting all
you're never gonna go back I'm gonna
give it three more runs yeah I like it I
think that's a solid number
I mean if you go back and watch the
first run you guys will see substantial
growth in these first few rooms
sometimes most of the time you guys look
I've been with the machine gun this high
this goes out quick if you let this
thing linger it just really yeah I have
learned that and that's that's something
we like really want to balance as the
prioritization of okay deal with like
these enemies first and then get to
these guys so that you can kind of boil
it down to a science that's exactly what
I like about learning a roguelike he's
not just you know because the mechanics
are easy point your gun at the thing you
want to die this guy's eventually but
the strategy what enemy needs to be
taken out first where do I need to go in
this room or are they like overlook the
room where the barrels working at their
grenades I've learned to hate jellyfish
and that's what makes the game like it's
Mikey there are some you know old school
shooters some some Limoges that boil
down to nothing more than running
backwards and just shooting in front of
yourselves all the time and it's like I
enjoy those four but I can't play them
longer than 15 to 20 minutes before I
get in good I think valve battle for me
so by having movies like I don't know
almost like a puzzle when you're playing
you know having the ground P assets
having enemies with fire at the FT dodge
you know the risk/reward with the
barrels the hope is just to create a
rule set in which round you try to
manipulate it you're finding this room
may have more acid on the ground and
after everyone's dead it might be a
hopping puzzle you know others you might
just have a bunch of gluttons stranded
bash your face and it's a lot easier to
kill them so I like the variety to comes
with them I agree I agree and I'm not
only do I agree I like hearing you talk
about it you're selling me more kind of
thing I already bought it's just because
you drank too many of those pills I'm
honestly that's going to tell me I'm
like really beautiful
I really think you may got a real thing
going
Oh in those moments I just caught it in
the stream it may be far back but you
shot a glutton and it like fell forward
and like it does the fountain of blood
just came right at you it's so stupid
but in VR that is so fun are like
sitting underneath the ceiling is
dripping blood it's like those old
horror movies you know where they have
like really gimmicky 3dp
oh yeah jaws 3d yeah naturally it's just
nothing beats nothing beats fine into 13
3d yep the pitchfork where they went
just far enough where it was kind of
worth it like Peter Jackson did the
grape cheesy slasher films you know I
love like brain-dead and Dead Alive
gotta live was beautiful I don't know if
I actually I think that's bad taste was
his first brain that was the original
name for New Zealand in the round in the
world and they called it dead alive when
they brought it here oh okay so they
really didn't meet the Feebles which
look that Muppet movie to have like sex
scene yeah like of course I haven't seen
it but I'm sure Jay loves it yeah just
hearing that I know Jay loves
it's like I almost crave the alternate
universe where he never left making
those types of movies so that we have
more like interesting sloth to watch
movie you know anybody uses the word
schlock is okay in my book
what's sexy maybe that's another word
can't they go hand in hand
yeah a little bit a little bit of peanut
butter a little bit of chocolate mixed
together
5:21 you come on you got a tight time if
you can rise to the end Oh getting used
to the delay is the hardest part did you
do it rich no I did yes I guess I was
that was just my my cheering groans
that's a rough one yeah like especially
since you're making it like that's the
scrap yard well we felt internally scrap
yard a hard layout right here because
you have the stalker in the back that's
shooting at you you know and then that
hi I'm Murray started yeah you already
did it once with the machine guns thing
so I wanted shrim
try the shotgun before I had a better
chance make the leaderboard just keep
going to shock you know what I'm already
giving up I've already given up I I
showed you that I showed you the problem
what do you thought yeah yeah but you
have to be careful with that secondary
yeah
oh I'm not as dumb as Jack I think I'll
be fine
it's driving you're not I agree but you
don't need to say it I say that out loud
no I don't mean it just talking about
corncob 3d oh oh yeah no that's fine I'm
not joking I still have that tab ready
for me to play if corn comes through the
influences of development astray at all
I'm going to be 3d as in like
stereoscopic right like it's the mother
first oculus games yeah well you need to
download the glasses it's the old 3d
glasses download print of my own okay
he's got the secondary down yeah you say
that you say that yeah yeah great time
we start so I can put in different game
alright but yeah guys I'm gonna have to
go in like five minutes so anything else
I can clear up for you think that
thought no no I appreciate you coming on
that was great that was great this is
the classiest this show has ever been I
real I'm known to bring the class mm-hmm
know you've done it we we appreciate the
time it gave us we hope we can make more
people aware of what seems to be an
incredibly fun oh let me just send this
link to your beer again here's good boom
oh wait this room is in subscriber mode
only oh here I'll help you hey
subscribers you know it's really cool
that Kickstarter what would be really
cool I know someone posting the link to
the straight
Kickstarter and if you guys don't then
I'm going through so I only assume one
of you will post the link to it no we
really appreciate you coming out this is
our first time having
I've been you know I've been checking in
to all the people stream and I'll stop
in for a minute because I'm like I'm
busy running things so like okay I need
to get back to it but um I'll check in
and see how hard it is for me to watch
other people play the game and then um
yeah once I think I came in right when
you guys didn't figure out how to get up
the lift you can say so by the way I
failed so much that you had to come and
help me and so you're welcome everyone
for my failure once I'm reading the
comment it's making me confused now well
what does don't read the comments yeah
it helps a lot if you don't worry oh
they're being nice now that I'm leaving
thanks for checking out the game I'm
psyched you guys got a chance to check
it out which is pretty much the best you
can get something that it's not a bag of
shit yeah I give this to knock bags I
give this to bags a urinal
this is dumb this is a bag of shit you
give it eight out of ten stuff
there's no killstreaks no kills free all
right now after after playing with that
shotgun this this machine gun just feels
great right yeah yeah you should be able
to like this should be the levels where
the stock is more forward or get in the
face of gluttons miss pop them off the
rail gonna be great for the next level I
think the machine gun is good for the
person first coming to the game and you
know just trying to get their bearings
so she got the machine gun I think it's
not as far as what I'm liking yes both
really I mean the secondary is a blast
it's so fast I am assuming ammo will be
more scarce in the final room yeah it's
gonna be Resident Evil by any means but
um we do want your scrap to do there's
an economy there we want are you gonna
be incredibly offensive bullet holes
even more defensive
down go through levels more methodically
because be very easy just to spam this
grenade will that's slowing that we
other talked about that today when we
are watching another screen people to do
yes yeah so you could use that to
totally game assistant right now you get
high on the leaderboard
if it doesn't run on my booty - I'm very
disapoint well you're in luck
well that's pretty sweet
he just like hold the lift down great
yes that's always the answer yes yes I
can never master John be a twenty I will
always be an apprentice to riches
masterful hunkering down skills it's
been taking a lot of my time is I think
someone mentioned in here nuclear throne
oh yeah I still that's you know watching
me play that is like watching you guys
play this right now I don't know make it
be fun that's not a really insulting
sorry about that you can insult me all
you want it's fine everybody does but uh
first of all add to boron thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it nothing
thrown is very akin to this just the
heart is fun but still very fun and I
think that's fir for people who are used
to a different kind of game that's a
hard thing for them to wrap their brain
around like something being difficult
also being fun but the fun is beating
the incredible challenge yeah
diamonds that float like I yeah I can't
play the chicken character cuz he slow
down time still can't beat that yeah
anyway I have a new angle but anyway yes
Tom thank you so much for joining us
yeah thanks for checking it out guys
great goodbye everyone
adios thank you for joining us just hung
up on him okay fixes in the zone I'm
loving this machine gun noise now that
I'm kind of used to the inverted
controls
I'm loving machine gun yeah no machine
can we just talk about how crazy was
that we talk to a game developer hey you
know that's gonna it was gonna happen
sooner or later the game review show of
mild popularity who's there doubt about
like math and shit and I was like I
don't know what you're saying but I love
it math is a fine thing is a fine thing
but like I don't understand how to make
a game I just know what it is to play a
game you know and so
hearing him talk about all of the things
that things to make a game it it made me
spoon Tom made me sooner I hope I hope
he was awesome and it was great what are
you winning us the attempts do it make
it happen
I know something blew up and Abu Liam Oh
Cooperman or cop alright I'm gonna give
this one more damn run and then do you
want to play more are you done Jack
Cooper copper man thank you for
subscribing we've really much very
appreciate it I mean I'm gonna play this
I think I'm actually going to play this
throughout the week so I might just we
might have a special stream yeah I can't
play it anymore tonight cuz I had too
much to drink I was fine that's fine
subscribe I can't do anything else
prayers
here's range 2k thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
apparently I did not destroy that I say
one more run I meant to take as many
runs as you need
I want to get on one of these
leaderboards check and succeed yes
dig neutral I'm having a ballast point
sculpin IPA and it's my favourite thing
that's the moment really slightly fruity
IPA so it's it doesn't it takes off a
lot of the things of I bet I don't
has the stream been going through six
hours I would I start at 6:00 I'm like
Jesus then I would believe it so
throughout the week I might just start
playing this on stream because it's a
game that I'm enjoying at the moment and
I'll be honest with you I kind of want
to get on that leaderboard kind I want
to get on that leaderboard not many
people have this version of the game I
feel like I can I don't want to get
number one I can't get everyone knowing
but I could get on really talk like that
you certainly never will know I just
know I know my own limits
I know my own limit but if I can get
like that fifth place
I'll be out just put a little bit I'll
see you in a cab you're too late Jack
I'm gonna do it right now odd wasn't
three minutes no hey if you get down
there with the prelector name then we
got ourself from it I'm just prereq
right now so there we go
then then do it all power to you and
then I'll have one by association
I'm catching up on the chat now
apparently there was one control and the
dad who kept on saying bad things that's
okay if it why don't this driver only
mode that just makes it easier
you can't are a sage to Kay you can't
just run past the enemies in this game
because you have to hit a certain
percentage of enemies killed in order to
win the game
and so how the hell do you get 90
percent in two minutes
it's insane people have done it grenades
I switched to a grenade heavy strategy
that last run and stole that was my
halfway with at the two-minute mark okay
be the evil per chair future the evil
few chairs saying try running avoiding
all the enemies then using grenades on
bunch two enemies as the door is opening
in the end
hmm as apparently build a seat except I
you frozen up
I have frost you froze alright I think
I'm done
I like music the music's great when when
I stopped playing it I can't hear the
music now cuz I'm just listening to you
when I stops playing it I missed the
music we had an actual stream we did two
thing we had a guest it's kind of
amazing I'm I'm still reeling from that
I think that was great
yep I think it was great cuz for like I
want to say that wasn't there a dev when
we were playing necrodancer the first
time yes and we similarly threw it out
there like yeah you want to call in and
you know they didn't oh god no yeah and
this time was like yeah that's great I
think it's great
Robert Bazaar JA says is it me or has
Jack been drinking I have been I
probably had one too many and I'm okay
with that because we're ending the
stream now and I had a really good time
playing this game I will stream I'm
planning on streaming this one other day
this week I'm looking at my calendar now
you know it'll be a surprise if you're
subscribed to the channel you'll get an
email and I'll tweet it I'm just gonna
play to see if I can get that
leaderboard Oh what you're talking about
