[Part I]
laughs what what what what not all right
shit what
don't anybody's in the room some people
are probably not watching those ever
house house nobody doing big as uh uh
yeah thanks pair to be pretty empty it's
not a streaming night the FARC and the
fuck is I'm here that's what the fuck oh
hello
I mean I'm playing dishonored to anyway
and I'm at the studio and my only real
plan for the night was I need to play
Dishonored 2 and Karen is likely busy
playing rollercoaster tycoon
so I can't really play this at home
right now I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do
this why not all right give me a quiet
stream because I need to play this game
I need to pay attention to what's what's
going on in the game so I am that's
gonna be mostly quiet stream you can
stick around and leave okay you know I
don't give no fucks and here we go
actually I want you to back up let's do
this tutorial my heart I'm at hard
yeah
someday
and so uh we're what's-her-face
I Garrett it's nice to have you back
yard
oh oh great not quite set up for that I
guess I could do that
what am I missing something do I have to
do that again but I made it under the
thing oh okay great I did not I did not
set my bindings with parkour in mind
I could switch my nose I'm yeah it's
fine
that's the
graphic settings like in here that's
right
full screen
pre-set slow
yeah ply those settings
won't need to do the reactive park or if
I'm sneaking that's good
but what
yeah it's more like it
no I've I've never done the space cop
voice during naughty time whatever that
means
sneaking up on Garrard something I never
thought I'd be doing
oh I guess that makes sense
that's right
oh there's a thing there's ooh how do i
zoom
click save shortcuts
she leaned sprint stray spyglass nope
that so the red thing it's annoying
how the little targeting icon is kind of
above what you're shooting at I got I
got spyglass bound to my little keep
head period key here and didn't seem to
work
where's it adding a spyglass yeah it
doesn't look like this it's just a
period but it's bound to something and
it's not zooming there's no zoom that's
not a big deal
spyglass is not working it's not zooming
I'm getting the button
it says infinite arrows but now I'm out
I guess that's the tutorial thing I hope
that's the tutorial thing I don't have a
spyglass okay
Oh
that's a nice option choked out during
combat
the smile was nice
if there's an echo it's probably the
speaker from the TV picking up on my
microphone I need to hear the game I'm
not doing anything about it I'm sorry
I'm sorry
PC no doubt yes
now this response to what am i playing
this on
can't I wear headphones catch you can't
you watch another goddamn stream this is
fucking bonus material
imma do it I'm okay I said I was gonna
be playing this anyway I'm like amazed
well stream it at may is most R and a
lot of people wanted to see more just
hunter too so side no I didn't finish
dishonored one because Jack had a
hard-on for doing a review on this and
he wasn't wrong because this is brand
new
I'm not really worried about spoilers I
I played two missions of Dishonored one
I can already tell you how it ends stop
the plague either provide me the elixir
cheaply or freely or a permanent cure
that they're holding back on because
people in charge of profiting off of it
save the girl killed the bad guys
slightly darker ending if you killed
more people I get it I get it
I knew how I knew how Dishonored was
gonna end after to the tutorial and
still rather play them an order but oh
well
I'm so proud of my sister yes
the screws gone on far more easily than
it should have my people be like yeah
you're gonna yep the Brutes think of the
system wouldn't anyone who can just
claim they're the Empress's lost sister
I don't think that would be so easy yeah
playing as Garrett
Corvo my ass we all know he's really
Garrett
what video cars is um so 960 or 980
inand video or 970 or the 980 I forgot
which I I forgot which I don't think I
got the top of the line at the time I'm
probably God don't like minute yeah it's
decent video card is the same video card
from when I built the PC on stream that
this is running on right now
and they say say this is much more juice
here
why don't we God
yeah read this shit later this is get
saved if you click on it yeah it's fine
set alarm
these investors aquarium sensitivities
are cirrhosis
so anywhere to hide if I set that alarm
assuming I can't just open this door
yeah he needed so I was not paying any
attention when Jack was playing
I swear I finally took this back
well I could that might not get there it
I guess it doesn't
miss I was trying some kind of plan
all right
we're skinny and I guess I just find the
key right no maybe I gotta feel dumb
oh I guess it's one way
Oh
you've got our maybe a single room there
was a
I'm sorry I can't hear you goodbye
meet my friends they say
I should have peeked that's actually
dumb quite dumb
if I jump let McDonagh noise
and go for a kill
never said it was doing a no-kill run
live it words in my mouth
are you doing non-lethal take them hey I
want a gun for now lethal if I knew
Ron you schmuck
well fuck
ring-ring
they actually run from you that's kind
of neat
shit
well I didn't kill him give me those
pairs
don't hurt a seasoned
okay
all right but did things I might never
go
why isn't who entertaining who I'm not
I'm not entertaining anybody
doing a relatively quiet playthrough of
this game that's all I'm doing
the steam notification front of a thing
I got a click yeah there's the steam
notification a part of thing I took like
I think God so much stuff to read
ain't got no time for none of it what
this toilet
I probably can't make that jump
murderer of
necessitous you've done this before
Corvo and in Garrett Corvette Corvette
I think GERD Corvo I'm gonna call them
Corvette it's funnier than Garrow what
oh shit I got a hiding spot here
anywhere
No
fuck
does he not have a way up here oh I'm
safe
if to put away your weapon well on that
F for me it's five but how much noise
does he make landing I guess I'll find
out oh not much
shit what that mean to shoot
that knockout punch is gonna be a little
bit overpowered in it
it's how did we get over there
no because I can't get up there
fuck
not doing brain
they're behind it
what that good for me not going so well
yes Steen get your get your
notifications off the fucking continue
button steam Jesus Christ not helpful
I'm sure
well fuck that
alright this is not working offer rate
due to his man
No how do I do that attack and and knock
out jump fall and knock out I tried to
do that just now and it didn't work I
must have hit a wrong button or I must
have fucked something up I'd very much
like to learn that right now I'm going
to redo the section until I learn how to
do that
well the attack button is the the stab
stab each tab which I'm trying not to do
alright that worked I got it I got the
hang
fuck's sake
hey wrong button
nope
part of this is getting used to the game
instead of choking them out when i
stunned them i I wanted this stealth you
hold the choke button you automatically
put him on your shoulder oh cool I like
it so far
I tried just holding down the block
button while that fall some curious
doesn't work and that did not work that
was an experiment that was not a fuckup
that was an experiment
I'd never made any I never made any
claims to a no death run this is a get
to know the game run this is a learn
learn what I'm doing run
ship is coming here early
the little room is not a good place to
be
so their patrols somewhat random
what happened what happened two guards
don't usually look up what happened to
that
they've taught me patience right now
this is feeling feeling my way around
goddamnit
all right can we just avoid these guys
probably take damage if I fall there
fuck it
okay okay that's it because I I have
gone into offline mode with steam it
should be fine all right so you're able
to play planet coaster okay okay
are you enjoying are you enjoying planet
coaster very much
oh you're watching the tutorial videos
for it okay okay well you you you enjoy
that I love you too alright bye bye
okay everyone I think I think we've come
to an agreement
I had to kick her off long enough to log
in so I could tell steam to start up an
offline mode
all right I probably law actually got
past that section but I turned the game
off once I realized we froze planet
coaster stream probably Sunday probably
Sunday all right there we go
all right here's the question Joey to
actually try and Stoldt this or do I do
this the fast way
oh I guess they just saw that there's
something there's something to be said
for the combat in this all right here we
go
hunk of actual stealth i'll give actual
stealth for one more chance
Oh enemies don't tend to look up except
they always do and we don't tend to look
up enemies don't tend to look up enemies
don't tend to look up enemies don't tend
to look up enemies look directly up into
the air and see you
so don't the thing they said the
tutorial ignore that it's bullshit it's
bullshit it's all bullshit all right
wait until they give up searching oh my
god you know what I'm not patient enough
for that
yo
this time we're not frozen I did this as
the game was freezing or as the stream
was freezing I was playing the game just
fine
any chance we'll play Sierra games again
in the future yes sure I want to avoid
the fucking point and clicks though
detection 26:26
it's fine
the no magic intrigues me but for
expedience sake
oh I
like how do I set things to the stand
wheel how do I change this stuff up
nope
key I want to bound do like okay okay
that's creepy
maybe
my playing is Corvo because patriarchy
well for one I don't have gender
dysphoria for other thing he's voiced by
Steven ruff Russell is he's they've gone
one step further with the whole thief
aping or homage
that rooms can be used to acquire
supernatural powers open the journal and
go to the powers tab to exchange runes
her powers
dawn shams provide minor supernatural
benefits locate them by listening for
the song they admit or use the heart to
detect them from further away by default
you can activate up to five bone charms
at once in the bone charm scent section
of yonder journal
all right
all right
why did all this get reset those are the
places I want those things and I want
them to stay there
hours right
my teapot confidence
he wanted to know if our alum was
interested in expanding its bass we
don't do fishing
turn up the game audio I thought it was
horribly echoey
when you
era
at this point you know I'm gonna do a
little experiment I'm gonna mute the TV
and you tell me if there's still an echo
all right where's my cursor there am is
there still an echo
things are falling apart in the clan God
is working up strange there's no echo
Plan B
where's Micah my hello
how does that work
I get infinite darts Wow anything
anything well I guess somebody needs to
be talking
ready for me to drop you at the docks
ready the old city must have changed a
lot off we go then one more time old
friend
get the ruin I didn't know about no room
I'm sorry I turned off a mic we weren't
using that seems to have done the trick
Corvo doesn't have a voice no he has the
voice no goddamnit and it's great
The Dukes given the Grand Garden run of
the city strangers get attacked on sight
I can take care of myself
breach atomizer take out the crown
killer and find out where Sokolov was
taken The Alchemist
Hypatia she can't I gotta I gotta tell
him even even if it weren't the the
voice of Garret from thief voicing Corvo
here I would still prefer a voiced
protagonist you're trying to do anything
vaguely narrative nothing takes me out
of it faster than a silent protagonist
you're not saying anything that people
keep talking to you it's the weirdest
thing I don't like it yeah well I'm
going to Kern now
somebody's packing weather yeah hurry up
all right get out of my way you fuckface
all right

[Part II]
doesn't have am i here am i here hello
hello
far Fig Newton can you hear me all right
I'm moving so I'm not frozen back all
right good good this is gonna be a
crash' Palooza
out of curiosity last stream when Jack
turned the settings dumb game ran
flawlessly the stream went flawlessly
didn't it I don't think it crashed once
after that ah I guess I'm just gonna
turn the settings in the game down
nothing crashing if that's what's
causing it
shame it looks nice I like it I like a
look visuals van settings Auto very high
hi welcome medium yeah you know I'll
just go low well not will not even risk
it oh no nope I wanted to apply that
all right
it's fucking ruins all over
I'm assuming I have to buy it
what do we got
client could be recovered just a bowling
sleep dart
I'll take those
let's see I have some upgrade plans for
you here
it seemed pretty stable to begin with
it's the only thing I can just hurry
pistol gentle planning using that much
none of that super exciting grenade
mines
let's go for a range
does rich love first-person shooters I
don't know it depends upon the style
we're talking about something like Call
of Duty is talking about something like
doom oh yeah I love that shit
Gears of War was tears Wars quality it's
good vanquish awesome uncharted that's
like a shooter five minutes for every
hour of walking around talking to people
and pretending it's gameplay because
technically you're holding forward on
the stick it's a pretend shooter
Oh
a wanted man again welcome home please
give me no choice
oh wait have enough it's too late for
that
anyone asks
he just ran through
the grand guard should be addressed to
the nearest guardsmen
nope nothing there all right that's
pretty easy
more Grand Guard soldiers that's to
avoid
you asleep anybody don't maybe search
the whole place I don't have time for
that no I thought maybe they'd do a
Looney Tunes everyone pass it worth a
shot
nope nope unless yakety sax is playing
there nothing fast you look it was worth
a shot
oh this should take me out to the
institution I'm curious how effective is
just running past everything in this
game no but we're there alright so not
that effective at least not here
station this should take me out to the
Institute well why are you saving right
at a spot where I'm about to get caught
game
I didn't read any yet because this is
almost a bonus stream I need to play
this game and I'm focusing on this game
and I'm not spending a lot of time
worried about reading things I'm sorry I
might do it later
fire station this should take me out to
the Institute
we need to get in there I think all
right
don't great doing great station this
should take me out to the Institute
think I just saw something station this
should take me out to the Institute show

tucking behind the fucking pillar what
do you want from me game I what I miss
about thief is the fucking light gem the
visibility Jim and you kind of had a
good idea how hidden you were like that
was a great time for that autosave when
the guys about to look up and see me
game that was great that is really great
forget about that kiss
yes at a Meyer station this should take
me out to the Institute
a terrible mistake from the past oh fuck
me
here I plan B fire station this should
take me out to the Institute
I thought I heard blood flies for a
second
fire station this should take me out to
the Institute
nope family I can't find a convenient
way around out of my health auto-refill
Abed I don't make this easier
stupid
an entire shipment just gone take it
away from under their noses idiots at a
Meyer station this should take me out to
the Institute
all right
you want to think it did yeah
did I accidentally
that's what I did want to go to medium
never been to that saloon Apollo's
shufai's Jason ladybirds
you can tell he's no good just looking
at his shoes it's kicking my ass
I just saw something
at a Myers station this should take me
out to the Institute
never
it's something to throw
there we go
yes--why usually hate playing thinks for
the first time on stream the adder Mayer
Institute is my best chance of tracking
down the crown killer Alexandria Hypatia
turned an old solarium into a center for
medicinal knowledge that's famous
throughout the iessons she's an
alchemist brilliant and dedicated to
helping the miners in Karnataka and
their families if anyone knows what
happened to Sokolov and where this all
leads
she will it's okay you enjoy watching me
fail well I'm glad
yep's prize stream boring stream cuz I'm
playing the game and I'm playing more
attention to the game than the stream
but y'all get the latch be fair I guess
there's value in that
who's around he was around let's try and
do this better more better er
arrange transfer Tatem I saw one of the
crown killer crime scene why do I bother
why do I bother
hey you let your friend die I'm just
gonna stab you
and Watchtower operations
anymore but you never know when the
Dukes gonna send someone out here to
check on the boy I got transferred to my
I saw one of the crown killer crime
scenes
whoever tore that old couples art you
were enjoying it so what do you think
I don't know coming back at dawn as much
as a blood on the windows
no no what
right click it's not the one I wanted to
hit in that particular scenario
anyone discussing a term are with nan
check that just making sure it's still
in order nobody comes around anymore but
you never know when the Dukes gonna send
someone out here to check on things
Zod he keeps an eye which rich rich rich
what what
oh and get up here without shenanigans
can I get up there
I can cool
that's more like it
all right how many people do we have in
here
no I guess they can't see me through
there how well there's almost neat
f5 f5 where you went up there before
no not that but not about me
our goddess
shut something unsavory going on I'm
getting good and drunk after
fuckers all of you fuckers
ah sorry it's a bitch
it's okay now head niche
what's in here it's just not much in
here all right
how do I switch to the sleep darts
all right
so I know what's going on in here that's
a bad door this is got to be a way
around
alright alright
let's see anybody in there listen here
what's in here
nothing nothing wait safeco nice 980
pays to read folks
what's that that quarter
nothing
someone got in the crown jewelers way
all right
I don't have time for no backstory maybe
later
I'm assuming I could break one of these
windows but I don't really want to
because there's someone in there be nice
if I could
I can't get it that one
err voices
alright alright
I wasn't upstairs
someone
or would come from
all right one guard we rolling down
there let's see anyone up here
don't say anywhere to freaking hide
either
great nope wait for a better opportunity
better opportunity
I've got the graphics turned all the way
down because it seems to keep crashing
the damn stream if I have the graphics
turned up it can look better than this
all right so you just go in a big circle
dammit
nope
too many in there oh shit
hey I'm still good for a while yeah that
one fucker didn't see me it would have
been great
just live no no this is all this is all
previously recorded
yeah you go there
oh well that once was a man from
I would say I'm going strong exactly
whatever
nope
kind of hates sucking it's not to my
liking
I started on hard now but medium as far
as the difficulty
there's too many guards oh my god it's
been near impossible to actually ghost
load why am i trying to go in there
everyone tells me I need to collect the
fucking rooms there's a room in there
all right the rooms can go fuck
themselves yeah I forget about the sleep
darts fair point
well I am and I'm why am i not murdering
everyone because I'm not Jack
look every time I try to just move past
somebody sees me as unlife unlike theif
it's it's never clear how well you're
hidden
up
Oh
I'm hungry
why are there so many guards
I can't go around that corner because
I'm sure there's 50 guards patrolling
around eight guys are gonna come down
that staircase is 20 around that corner
really want to get that room that's in
here I don't think it's going to happen
I can't pick one of those throw them no
it's not gonna let me do that
anybody don't make me search the whole
place nope that didn't work out
I'm not reading tips today because I
need to play I need to play this I can't
do that if I'm reading tips every two
seconds I appreciate it
maybe I'll read them before I'm done but
not doing it right now I'm sorry
could be fun but this is like 20 guards
around every corner I'm gonna try the
dart thing again because maybe maybe if
I don't hit the helmet like I did that
time it won't be a problem
somebody's down
whoever did this must still be around
we're must still be around whoever did
this
that did it
I'm not playing with that weird gaming
stick Oh for fuck's sake
I'm not hitting f5 because I don't know
I know I'm sucking but as general rule
I'd try not to save scum as a general
rule
is there
oh great
nope
that plan was genius
genius
I didn't realize that was a super alarm
I just wanted a distraction to lure some
guys out of that room I figured maybe I
could sneak up behind them as they're
going the other way and it realized it
was gonna be a continuous and serious
thing
you make sure she stays well cheese
in case anyone asks the grounds unless
it's on official business for the Duke
got it
well said dead-end
suspicious
yeah I guess it's fine wherever
I so enjoy watching history warp as
woman's past from the lips of one to the
ears of another and perfectly for half
understood poorly remembered in the
years to come the story of the crown
killer will be twisted and bent hammered
like soft metal by some cows a monster
and had to be put down by others a
victim of treachery preserved because in
the end you've found another way but
you'll always remember the truth won't
you no truth at least
look didn't quite mean to fall there's
something I'm missing here
what is this still a marker I did all
the things right I've got all these
bones arms it's madness that's where I
came down from
that's not really much in here oh well
I gotta say after 40 or 80 times this
bone shine bone china LED take out your
hat it's getting really annoying
yep that's worth a shot
take I'd you have bone charms around
rooms available take god yeah that
message may hold is always beyond the
bottom of the screen
what's in the door is it a bomb job get
the bug job we try for doors blocked oh
I can't I can't
door was blocked
the blood flies have gotten out of hand
here
anam
Vanja
nearby did put the drinking of the
center on my fucking screen every time
patience mine I'm sorry I I should know
that I'm here to ask you about something
do you cover your face because you will
hurt the afflictions we treat here are
more common than anyone likes to admit
I'm not here for treatment looking for
Anton so yes he was here for a short
time but she took him away to see Karen
Jim Josh do you do you hear something
what about the crown killer a patient of
yours or the crown killer that name came
from the newspapers I'm afraid I don't
oh yes the murders I wasn't done Bob
studying diseases found among whaling
crew wait did someone just call me I've
been forgetting things
the crown killer is an interesting case
I feel almost sure I could help with
that it's just I used to do such good
work and now my memory is failing me who
is that calling me excuse me
we don't get visitors very often only
one recently I forget
I've gotten something under my
fingernails again
all right well now one I didn't used to
lose things like this
what's wrong with you
yeah touch that that diseased patient
right in this filthy soap no hustle
covered arms reminders the first version
had caused horrible changes to our mind
it's too late for me but maybe you can
still save her she's a good person what
can I do in my safe in disease treatment
you'll figure out it I'm gonna make that
counter serum her help her
okay the safe codename is five five one
they told me I'd taste royal blood when
they took the throne
she's gone what happened
look that fucker
yeah you know writing hope I'm not gonna
complain right now those bugs are
annoying
I could destroy those mists it's worth a
shot
I was shooting at him earlier didn't
seem to be doing anything
and I worth it totally not fucking worth
it I'm just getting out here
shoot them with the gun is that what the
bullets are for they're also for
alerting every guard and the building
which is something I'd like to not do
all right it was worth a shot
window
do you
so how do I use some of those potions
I'm picking up
hmm
thank you
tea in lime all right
would you
did she shoot him he tried to strangle
me I had no choice did she probably just
did it I'm sure he didn't try to
strangle her that's great
god damn it why didn't I keep looking
nope no look the other way
where she go
where did she go that's not good what
not in there
how's it going she's going pretty good I
like this game
oh please inside
some tainted blood and heat the final
mixture ESCOs knows something this is
something we have to do which would be
neat
can you turn off the objective markers
in the sum assuming you can and again
purposes of the stream be being lost
reverie wouldn't be good but one thing
I'll say that I miss from the thief
games was just a mild level of detective
work like you need to find infective
blood now like I fire playing thief and
like love it were some kind of hospital
I would look for a morgue like I would
look at my map and see if something
indicated where morgue would be and I
would make my way there I know I'm gonna
turn this on there's gonna be an
indicated marker saying go ahead to the
the corpses and once again that only
works there's like a some way I could
figure it out myself in the game like
the level makes sense think there's a
map the basement the more trouble you
innovate like something like that I
don't know but you know well I'm
streaming this and since I need to get
through this game a little bit quicker
I'm gonna leave that on but it gets
points it gets points if you could turn
that off
affected body yeah
oh that's close to
disgusting
all right now I need to heat this right
a Bunsen burner ham something's missing
you haven't joined the game it's getting
my butt kicked earlier I'm getting uh
I'm getting my groove slowly but surely
you know let's Stephen Russell doing the
voice every now and then I feel like I'm
playing thief every now and then
whenever you hear that voice you're
sneaking around it's good times it's
just good times
no that's not the oh I wanted to knock
her out first don't worry I'm going to
take care of it if you need a place to
lay low for a few days come find us wael
trusting her awful lot
not quite Garret
all right seconds we just gotta get out
of here then
all I can imagine is people over there
he's a janitor as far back as the old
tube field Dennis that's too long
no oh there we go
at least did it

want to bother
no let's just get out of here let's just
get out of here I was gonna get that
other room but yeah then again that's
mostly cleared out let's see if it's
gonna be a nightmare to get this one I'm
not gonna bother
yep nope it was not a successful blog
I'm gonna see what's in there
I'm gonna read tips later later I'm
playing a game not double teaming with
Jack tonight where somebody can read
tips the other one complain the whole
goal is I got a I got a play dishonored

I guess doctor my patients seeing
patients thief was almost vaguely thief
like for a second there nope not exactly
what I wanted to do
all right there stairs to go down or
something like right
so my mist
well that's kind of creepy
and that's uh don't want to mess with
that whatever it is we're not fucking
with it well that last room I can't get
it set a down elevator yeah
watching of the everyone is dead now we
get down there
there's just no way down well Gabi wait
I wouldn't be there

nope fuck some mom
so anyway to go I know you can beat this
game without powers is there any way to
do this without blink I just used blank
for now if I get I got shit to do
everything here we're stealing
oh man I just pickpocketed a fucking
waiter a fucking dishwasher I am a
terrible person and I guess it's a
kitchen so there won't be piles of cash
sitting around
at times this feels very much like thief
you thought this game was broken as fuck
on PC maybe if you got a crap PC that
didn't work out so well that didn't work
out so well
now we're all he's my quicksave bad idea
that was a fantastic idea just didn't
work

routine again but okay this is a good
safe

playing without magic how do you get
dumped here without dying

didn't die though oh hello
