[Part I]
Jay: We don't know what happened to Rich Evans.
Jack: We don't...I'm reading, John Kilo, I'm reading your resume right now, and so far enjoying it. Hold on.
Jay: I don't, I don't refuse to look at Deadly Premonition. We just haven't. But people keep saying if I like Twin Peaks, I should play Deadly Premonition, so...Oh, favorite Kubrick movie. Oh...that's a tough one. You know, I'm probably gonna have to say The Shining, just cuz I'm a horror guy, and I love The Shining. 
Jack: I think it's good.
Jay: He's made some good movies, though, that Stanley Kubrick.
Jack: The Shining...
Jay: You know what I love, that a lot of people think is, like, one of his least movies, is the Eyes Wide Shut.
Jack: Yeah.
Jay: I love that movie, yeah.
Jack: I think maybe I saw that too late.
Jay: I saw it, I saw it opening weekend. I'm so glad I got to see a Kubrick movie in the theater, cuz that when I was old enough to where I could.
Jack: Oh, no. I meant too late in my life, like, before that, I just, like, watched all of the classics. 
Jay: Oh, sure.
Jack: All the Kubrick classics. And then, like, it is a bit of a, a jump from the classics to...
Jay: Well, it's a different type of movie. I'm a big fan of, uh, uh, like, Dark Night of the Soul-type movies. Like, a lot of that, most of that movie takes place over the course of one night.
Jack: Yeah, yeah.
Jay: It's, uh, Tom Cruise just, you know, walking the streets at night, and, yeah, it's really, like, seedy, and I like that kind of stuff, so...
Jack: All right.
Jay: I like that movie a lot. 
Jack: I like...
Jack: And, of course, the, the costume party orgy is just one of the best scenes he's ever filmed.
Jack: Yeah.
Jay: You like what?
Jack: Oh, oh, I was just, I was, I didn't know you were done with that yet. You know, I, I also like what, when he went into the costume shop, right, and then that actress is there.
Jay: Oh, Leelee Sobieski.
Jack: She offers herself to him, and then he comes back later, and her father's in on it. Yeah, yeah, it looked neat.
Jay: She's, she's hiding in the closet with two half-naked Asian men.
Jack: Neat.
Jay: It's a good movie.
Jack: It is. I was gonna say, from a technical standpoint, Barry Lyndon...
Jay: I've never seen Barry London, actually.
Jack: It's very boring.
Jay: That's fine.
Jack: Much like most Kubrick.
Jay: I was gonna say, it's Kubrick. I'm sure it's slow.
Jack: The, but the story behind Barry Lyndon is, uh, Kubrick wanted to shoot it, shoot it with all-natural lighting.
Jay: Hm.
Jack: Top piece lighting, which is all candlelit.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: And so he needed a lens with a low enough f-, f-stop, to only light his scenes with candles.
Jay: Hm.
Jack: And so he actually got a replica of the lens they used on the moon.
Jay: Oh, my god.
Jack: Because that, they needed it, incredibly...
Jay: Is that partially where the, the myth that Stanley Kubrick filmed the fake moon landing...
Jack: Yes.
Jay: ...is that where that comes from?
Jack: Yes. that is where that comes from.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: And so, you know, watching Barry Lyndon, just from, like, a camera operator's standpoint is beautiful.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: It's, it's just a beautifully-shot movie, all with natural light.
so yeah I've got a
couvert box I like it's in there I just
haven't watched it take a day yeah
that's great you could have dinner with
any of his movies like you have to set
the day aside to what watching and
watching Magnolia or something like this
is what I'm doing today yes this is a
green will make a nice lunch and then
the rest of my day will be filled with
watching this movie Oh Green Green you
know the shining you know you just
hearing you call that a horror movie
it's so not it's so great that's it's I
mean it's not what psychological it's
it's essentially a horror it's a
thriller
yeah I don't like those labels when they
call it like Silence of the Lambs as a
psychological thriller that's a four
movie shining is great shine is great
yeah I just you know I don't know I'm
sure people are already typing yeah I
add a thing the other night where I
don't know what started it but I was
thinking about Shelley Duvall because
she's great in that movie yeah really
good actress she's also kind of
funny-looking
I was like what the hell ever happened
to Shelley Duvall that's a good question
so I looked her up on IMDB she hasn't
been in a movie in over a decade and
before that her roles were kind of
sparse where's she
she was olive oil she was olive oil in
the Popeye movie yeah but where's
Shelley Duvall was she doing these days
what happened to her did she retire
okay do you know where Shelley Duvall is
was the shining her last big thing no no
she did stuff all throughout the 80s um
actually her last maybe not her last but
one of the last bigger things she did
was a movie called home fries do you
remember this movie with Drew Barrymore
and Luke Wilson came out when I was in
high school oh she placed your
Barrymore's mom in it is that the one
where Drew Barrymore has to go back to
high school no that is not a quarter uh
what's the name of that movie never been
kissed bitch if rich are in the room
right now we can tell you Mike and him
or extras in that movie oh we're never
been kissed Kylie film in Chicago ah
there in the background at a carnival or
something I don't think I've even seen
the movie there oh that's good that's
good information
okay so home fries I don't know anything
about the movie she works in like a fast
food place but as Shelley Duvall's in it
I discovered that when I was trying to
figure out what the hell ever happened
to Shelley Duvall well now we know that
maybe it's just because she is Emma she
is she's interesting looking yeah and
she's worth to I mean she worked for
Kubrick she worked with Robert Altman
like she worked with all these huge
directors I'm just trying to think you
know obviously for Popeye she just looks
like Island shit yeah you could not cast
anyone better as all of them and in the
shining having her be so strange-looking
adds a little bit to the strangeness of
the movie oh yeah and so I just wonder
if that was it like those are the roles
she was getting and she decided not to
take them who's like a good nun how
would she work through the Elm to Woody
Allen Robert Altman Stanley Kubrick I
guess I'm retired to like plug it's all
downhill from here could you imagine
like could you imagine doing a home
fries doing that might have been what
killed it what the fuck are you due Luke
Wilson I'm out of here just like talking
to whatever the hack director hey man oh
actually the guy I don't know who
directed it but I know the guy that
wrote it uh was the creator of Breaking
Bad he went on to be the creator Mickey
bad oh yeah there was some prize about
drew I don't know oh that's right you
don't know I know you're very much I
remember coming out when I was in high
school sure bear whores pregnant in it
and she works at a fast food place
that's all I know
okay we might not be streaming anymore
no we're still free right any huh yeah
someone just said Annie Hall that's
correct
hmm you guys still getting this is
happening where is he
we might have also lost Richards
alright alright
we are still streaming right we are t
will is miss our incredible home fries
discussion
oh god no but for some reason it's not
showing me correct thing oh there it is
Jack when's the next Plinkett review you
guys I hate to spoil it and Jay I hope
you're okay with me and giving out this
information oh it's fine it's it's
actually coming out tomorrow you guys
it's coming out tomorrow
probably around 1:00 eleven twelve
o'clock kind of midday Central Time
yeah Central Time midday um and it is
going to be on home fries really so
weird that is such a weird coincidence
we've been biting our tongue this entire
time I didn't even know um oh my god I'm
totally fucking you guys are gonna see
some weird shit it's really like like
weird home fries it's like weird well
listen I don't want to spoil any of
Plinkett's insightful insightful tidbits
about Home Fries so I'm not gonna sit oh
my god we also we just might have to
call it because we're having pretty big
technical issues oh really
we're having more that screen funny oh
alright I am back rich can you tell any
stories about being an extra uh never
been kissed
no being an extra is the dullest fucking
thing it is we we sat in a room me and
Mike I think it was literally ten hours
and then we were out for like an hour
worth of actual filming it mmm like a
merry-go-round or something um no what
I'm rubber big on me yeah
Ferris wheel a ferris wheel okay hate to
be the jackass I'm like the roller
coaster oh god wait done yeah they told
us to come back the next day we did not
alright I think I fixed our fluttering
problem I no longer see flutterings how
much did they pay you do you even
remember and you get paid very very
little to be an extra I don't recall it
wasn't that much never was for works I
worked
technically as an extra on the nightmare
and almost remake for one day oh no it
was an extra you are like going to be
the stand-in er so you do write I
originally contacted them this is when
we were just shooting weddings at a lot
of free time and I grew up a huge fan of
Friday it was like holy fuck they're
filming the remake in Chicago maybe I'll
try and get be an extra on that so I
contacted the extras person and then
they said they said hey you're your
height and weight you're perfect to be
the stand-in for one of our lead actors
also Kyle Gallner was his name I think
he was in Haunting in Connecticut or
something like that but they want me to
be his standin so I went down there for
one day and they took a bunch of
reference photos of me standing next to
him I got to meet Jackie Earle Haley I
got to see him try Alma's Freddie
sweater for the first time which was
cool and I got paid for that one day of
just hanging out on the set before they
even started shooting and then I
realized oh fuck I would have to do this
for two months and just stand around
while they liked the scene yep I was
like that's not worth it so then I just
I just quit like I was there for one day
I got to talk to Jackie Earle Haley I
got to see you know the sets and the
costumes um that's all I need I'm not
gonna stand around for two months you
could have made so many contacts you'd
be making you be directing big Hollywood
for Jesus yeah I don't think that's true
I don't think that's how it's where I
that's how it works you could have
directed 2012 what the movie looked like
a clusterfuck and I guess that turned
out to be the case - but like they one
of the lead actresses who was playing
the not Nancy but the the the other girl
the equivalent of the Amanda Weiss
character from the original the one who
gets flipped around the room you know
upside down and stuff yeah they were
like a week away from shooting and they
hadn't even cast her yet it's just a
mess the summer though it could have
been into the storm directed haha by
j-bone this is the thing though it was
like I wanted to do this not because I
wanted any sort of in on a Hollywood
movie because I could not care less but
just because I was excited to be on the
set of a Freddy movie it's all I cared
about and then I realized while being
there and listening that the people
talked that nobody involved could have
cared less about being working on a
Freddy movie the Jackie Earle Haley this
was clearly just a job for him all these
people they were it was just a job it
wasn't anyone but like Freddy especially
or in any connection to the series it
was just a cash-in remake Oh Jack if you
considered rebooting everything um that
well that's a question for all of us how
much longer do we feel like going
because yeah everything by the way on
our end is absolutely failing I am kind
of shocked my back has lasted this long
okay I just had a minor episode I
actually want to do some stretches okay
because so that what that means is we
are gonna call it because literally the
game is not working my little just wait
yell video is not working oh wow and so
happening I have just so much no idea we
got some gun point then we got a lot of
good but we got some papers please

internet it feels enjoy is that a thing
on the internet the dick but apparently
I've never heard of this door of I know
what is it it might one of the origins
of the dick but I don't know it might be
a reddit thing okay I because that's
where I usually see it mmm it's it's
just something where like I'll see a
video and like the videos I always see
it is is like you know in movies where
they show someone they're looking down
at a piece of paper and they go ah and
then they show the piece of paper and
that someone like digitally inserts the
big butt on the piece paper okay it's
funny it's all funny stuff
I see rich have you ever owned a fedora
well when I was a kid for Halloween I
was Indiana Jones at one point so oh
yeah at some point my life I guess I did
own a fedora no that's right Ison flames
Jack likes dick but and he cannot lie

what
I'm glad you get so much of use man out
of it I don't get it I really do
I can't explain why I don't know all
right
I don't know it shut up love them I just
see it on reddit all the time is what
I'm saying
you
let's see here this is the source of
dick butt
okay thank you for the source of dick
but
favorite movie soundtracks oh that's a
good that's a good question
score or just song that collection of
song you know it's a really amazing
soundtrack with both score and
collection of songs what is that Royal
Tenenbaums oh yes I would agree with
that mark mothersbaugh does all the
original score hmm and it's beautiful
like orchestral stuff oh yeah a bunch of
bunch of classic kind of funky rock
stuff yeah
well ten above some crackers and the use
of the songs in the movie are perfect so
that's a good marriage of song in the
movie yeah I love the score too
punch-drunk love John Bryan why are you
laughing at that just cuz I know you do
it it is the best score I think that
score is so amazing it's and it's so
perfect for that movie yes that is very
true I've got this kind of the balls
okay that rich is playing checkers by
the way for a moment there I do forget
I'm glad that you're happy it makes me
happy that you're happy um just as far
as like general scores I think we've
talked about this before I listen to the
Tron soundtrack Tron Legacy Tron Legacy
yeah yeah
donc music that's good like I'll just
put that out in the background while I
work and it like motivates me yeah
that's one where before the movie came
out you here dot Punk is doing the score
for Tron Legacy did you think and that
could not be more perfect right it's so
great yeah and I watched that trailer
for that movie so many times and that
music just like gave me goosebumps
yeah it's a great soundtrack hmm rich
Evans confirmed for checkers god it's
true checkers cut that's really true
another great soundtrack is Miami
connection of course
looks like Wando bands songs and that
are pretty amazing
I know some people who do Taekwondo and
they did not know about Miami connection
because of course who wouldn't they yeah
and I showed them the both of both the
friends forever song but more
importantly the against the ninja song
which has the course of time icon
Taekwon yeah Taekwondo they loved it so
hard that they are going to create a
weapons routine using that oh that's
great bag that I can go there and film
against the ninja yeah I think I stopped
listening to soundtracks I don't send a
lot of soundtracks in high school that's
always discovered a lot of bands so they
get jaronda that I eventually ended up
liking was through soundtracks because I
was more into movies than music so I buy
soundtracks I mean like oh I like this
song I'll get a bat will buy this band
oh sure sure sure and just like
everybody in eternity owned like the
Reservoir Dogs on track oh sure and the
pulp fiction is out of drag but that's
fine because those were good soundtrack
I had the the South Park movie
soundtrack yeah and I got it before the
movie came out so that entire summer
that was the soundtrack in my car that
was that we were just listening to that
constantly absolutely before the movie
and then so we saw the movie we knew all
the songs and then the rest of the
summer we were just listening to that
over and over I love that soundtrack I
love those songs that movie but that
movie was something special that's the
first movie I bought on blu-ray when I
got a blu-ray player really yep that's
funny get a blu-ray player higher
definition the first thing I got was the
South Park movie nice tent but is cheesy
God you know cutout animation white wins
congratulations

playing or Jevons they're firing returns

let's see here
you
what Oh what are you guys playing
tonight right now this is it we're
playing fucking checkers we we had
planned to play some FTL and for some
reason open broadcaster was twitching
out I don't think it was anything on my
computer because my game screen wasn't
flickering hmm but the open mind it's
not doing it for this it's not doing it
for this my game was it wasn't
flickering but my open broadcaster
preview screen was flickering and of
course the stream was flickering and I
tried messing around with some game
settings and that didn't seem to help so
I don't know what it was
have you guys ever been to the safe
house we live in Milwaukee so yes yeah
everybody's been in the safe house
everybody's been to the safe house it's
yeah you know what go once it's fun if
you have relatives from out of town
that's retaking taken to the safe house
yeah if you are planning a aah I went
there for as part of my bachelor party
bar crawl I'm sure they take they take
you they do something special oh yeah
so if you are planning a bachelor party
in the Milwaukee area take him to the
safe house and set it up it's it fun
okay that was a fun time and I used to
do open mic nights there oh yeah no you
know they did that there they well they
don't end up there anymore they used to
I see back in the day
uh you know so I've seen this a couple
times in the chat favorite Wes Anderson
film to me they're all the same I can
see that I've actually not seen a Wes
Anderson films since the Royal
Tenenbaums really yeah I haven't seen
you just you see the trailers and you
say oh that looks like more of the same
yeah I can understand that I like most
of his movies my favorite you mean seen
the life aquatic nope I love the life
aquatic beer Bill Murray fan you should
watch the life quad bill Marvin it's but
I'm I know when I would I best
soundtracks I would say that one to that
is very good yeah I know what I'm gonna
get you know and I don't think you do
though after that one I would agree with
you yeah but that one I want something
special I like that it would be a lot
okay that's got the the most emotional
core to it for me personally okay I
think most people say that about
probably Rushmore or Royal Tenenbaums
but the Bill Murray character that his
character in life aquatic like he's
really tragic and it's oh it's good it's
good okay I would really recommend you
know what I will give a life aquatic but
try okay
you should because of your
recommendation and ruled befoe is
hilarious in it he's got a supporting
role in and he's just funny oh good yeah
I have stayed away from of course you
know being someone who's into film I you
know sob Rushmore in love did Rushmore's
gray went back and saw bottle rocket got
it immediately it was just like oh man
yeah Tenenbaums is beautiful 10 mm
beautiful movie and then it and then I
saw the previews for Life Aquatic I saw
a little bit of the fantastic mr. Fox
since I have like I get it I get it I
can understand that I get what he's
going for and you know what he's got a
thing and that's great for him hmm
I'm just no oh I understand
let's go I'm glad you understand
you see my big this is my big travel
coffee mug that is huge yeah it's great
I fill it up with coffee and I filled up
with iced coffee
holy Lord that's a lot of iced coffee
yeah but it like I recently took a very
long road trip and so I filled this up
with iced coffee before I left and just
the entirety of the five-hour road trip
just slowly drank the whole Oh champ it
was great that way I lost you lost a lot
Oh No
happens every now and then was it a good
game that was good game okay
he got me fair and square Aaron squared
hmm that's good yeah oh they're seeing
it right now oh they're saying you
should rage quit hmm oh that's funny you
were the chosen one rich well yeah one
chance I can't play it on a game nope
uh no the Tusk trailer Oh have you seen
that J I haven't do you know about it I
haven't Smith's name of a No it's the
human centipede
it looks like the human centipede but
instead of making a human centipede he
makes a guy into a ball wrist that's
that's the premise of the movie great I
don't know you know what I'll say is I
appreciate that Kevin Smith is at least
trying different things because for a
while you'd see his movies it's like oh
it's more of the same you know and I'll
give him credit for that I think red
stain isn't have you seen red static god
no come on it's an interesting failure
as I'll describe it all right but uh and
then this is something completely
different so I don't know I'm just so
sick of him as a personality and I think
he needs to stop trying outside of the
box
no because here long to just make like
Jay and Silent Bob movies till the end
of time not chanson Babu is here's the
thing that I've always liked about Kevin
Smith I've let I've always liked him as
a writer and as a director he's I don't
think he's very good no because he was
meant to be a writer but I've always
thought that his movies were very
personal to him yeah and I've always
gotten them until he started veering off
course even Jersey girl yeah by God
which isn't as bad as a lot of people
make it out it's it's a small city very
small T it's a small T movie but you
know what he would he had just had a
daughter like you know it was a movie
about a father and a daughter it was
personal and I got that the one good
thing about that movie is George Carlin
yeah really good nut he's really good
it's it's not I mean it's not a great
movie I would even call it a good movie
it's not a good one but I under his feet
you'd see yeah it's fine and you know
what but but also like for him as a
writer and as a director it made sense
yeah he was doing a personal story um
then you get into stuff like the cop
boats in the red space cuff up is so bad
where he tries where he tries to go
outside of his box it's just like no
even clerks - I like clerks - actually
it's fine now you know what it was it
was a an allegory of what he was going
through and like it made sense yeah yeah
sometimes you got to stick to what you
know but now what he knows is smoking
pot all the time and I'm thinking things
are hilarious while he's smoking pot and
then making a whole script based on some
random idea he had he joked about and
you know maybe that's fine
that's what he's doing that's been
that's fine just maybe he should stop
directing things well then he he said
said he was gonna quit
didn't he retire like five years ago and
he just keeps making movies yeah it
doesn't it doesn't matter doesn't he do
like podcasts or something that's his
main thing his podcast yeah just let him
do that well yeah that's that but he was
gonna stop making movies now and just
focus on that stuff but then he just
keeps making these fucking movies
I don't know I don't know about him
obviously it's just like he was a very
important gateway for me as a 13 14 year
olds a gateway into other independent
movies so he certainly had a very
important purpose for everyone for a lot
of people of our age for everyone of our
generation yeah he he was the start of
it all yeah Jesus Christ you know he can
make a movie yeah yeah so is that easy
yeah well and then like with curses you
know rain interviews and hearing about
the movies that influenced him and then
going out you know looking at those
movies I discovered a lot of stuff
because of that movie oh no I'm just in
like discovering just like the
independent circuit you know like I
remember like very shortly after that
seeing el Mariachi yeah and just like oh
my god movies can exist this small this
is great yeah yeah
no it's all good things and you know
what I know a lot of people will
recently have been shitting on mall rats
the Moritz no I like Mallrats everyone
likes Mary Margaret is a cute kind of
throwback to the best times at ridgemont
high type team visit Kevin Smith grew up
when I saw I usually haven't watched it
in a really long time I have a feeling
it would not hold up that great that's a
good point I I did like it a lot when it
came I saw it as a teenager and loved
the shit out of it mostly cuz you see
Joey Lawrence Adam's boobs whatever they
go back to Shelley Duvall what happened
to Joey Lauren Adams she recently was uh
in the United States of Tara she's still
acting oh she is I can't read last time
I saw her in anything she was good in
the United States Tara - I don't know if

husband is someone alone in and I have
no clue nine states there Joey Lawrence
arrows show the boobs and the mall rats

time at the time I felt I'm okay that's
a good way to put it yeah at the time I
saw mall rats I got to see her boobs and
I was young enough to the need to see
them

gonna happen you got all the oh wait hey
listen this is my first time playing

you're just used to gamepad the
struggles are fine you can do one hand
with just like the gamepad if you want
her to remap the keys with your your
xpadder or whatever that program is in
case it's not already obvious long Falls
don't kill you now you can just jump out
of that window but they kill other
people
well you you have you and you're
actually well you'll see why you're
wearing magic pants they're not really
magic but I'm wearing magic pants oh
good yeah you guys found the fuck but we
got we finally got our football emoticon
oh nice exit stage right
there's nothing else you can do them not
that I know of I don't think there's
anything else we look at this is the
jumping controls hold down jump and you
aim it's why I think you don't play with
a a gamepad there's the jumping and then
there's equipment you get later this we
use multi heavy heinie
yeah yeah but do you see me jump Dan
yeah are you this little for the whole
game yeah dear Lord

see ya see they did it they did a thing
that's fun
he did a thing we with the chatot on
here is it not gonna happen
ah don't worry about it it's been Oh
point gun point
oh the title came up just come on now
for the people watching lag let's sit
here oh sorry I'm supposed to be gone
way this is Melanie rook Selena Devin
Gatto worked for me do you have time to
talk
oh oh okay er oh these are text messages
yeah yeah haha Jack are there spikes in
this game I don't know yeah this is my
first time I asked if there are spikes
in the game spoilers there are no spikes
oh no that's a big spoiler okay let's
see here I know you didn't kill Selena I
just watched the footage you walked
right in front of a security camera on
their way to Selena's office after the
shots were fired but the East Point
Police won't look beyond an easy
conviction the footage puts you at the
scene and I have to turn it over to them
why do you care or I agree that I am
boned why do you care Brooke his typing
brush Selena was a friend I want her
real killer caught in fact I wanted dead
but once he's in jail so that becomes
simpler to achieve I have to hand that
footage over if I have it let's make
sure I don't have it I've wiped my copy
but my camera feeds get backed up to a
data center and five different off-site
locations if you can wipe them all
hearing that clear and the police won't
have to find the real killer that
actually sounds fairly wise
head to the dataset facility at Port
Health I'll make sure the front door is
open but here take it familiar there I
hate this voice you're doing that's my
that's my leg let me let me try it
that's much worse
oh my god girl like breathy kind of I
should say they're both bad okay oh no I
don't want someone to feel that they're
better than the other because they're
both bad okay okay good no I feel if you
look at the bottom before you go into
the Miss showing there's some things
down okay and it's kind of a half up
grades because you can like change your
mind and go back and just reassign your
points oh okay bullfrog jump strength
increases both speed and distance
traveled charge of full strength jump
more quickly well I probably want that
yeah then you don't have enough to buy
anything right now but there's also a
shop and you can buy like got upgraded
moves and new things you can do okay
cool hey that's cool yeah I feel like
Jack is not the official girl sorry J
sorry that's alright okay let's accept
this I'll get thirty dollars to prove my
innocence
anything at all your proving your
innocence okay let's try a little more
subtle remove feminine voice Jackson
third girl boy yeah you're right I
should do the girl boys okay I'll try
something a little more subtle on the
top floor of this building there's a
bank of servers with a computer nearby
if you can get to that you can wipe the
evidence that you were at our offices
when Selena was killed how do I get in
I've had one of our tech guys open the
front door for you their electrical
systems are hackable from here but for
obvious reasons their servers aren't how
do I wipe the data I've seen your record
this will be within your abilities once
you're in the scrubber script I'm
sending you will Auto wipe anything with
today's data ending in dot mp4 that's
really nice that they use the Adobe
codec because it says it's not you know
it's smaller font mission special
appearance by space cop hold down the
left mouse button this is there a
mijeong these are the early tutorial
esque ones i mean you literally just run
into the building and grab what you need
this is all i want to do in the game I
don't want to walk I can only assume I
have to jump over that light so I'm not
seeing them no surprisingly no I kept
doing that and doing it and it turns out
it never makes a difference oh really
yeah cuz like wow
whoa that's cool saying I should be able
to go you can't you can't jump through
the window while you're on it I think
you know what that makes sense let's fry
maybe maybe I just did it wrong but one
time I tried a lot so it's worth trying
I can't reach no that's fine I'll go up
here okay that need moms over thinks it
shows you whether you're on that's right
there that's your main objective now go
into the room under that every that
seems most every levels got like a
little tiny laptop okay we're like a
collectable data file then I can steal
yeah like read emails
sure sure I get hope oh that's the most
fun just flopping all right
pack two please subject private security
I've heard grumbling lately from some
officers about your private security
assignments since we merged with the
state's largest security firm the East
Point Police Department now serves both
roles you might not like working for a
corporation but your job is the same
protect and serve with the endless
budget cuts we've been through the new
funding from the merger is the only
reason we've seen halfway adequate
equipment okay great so this is some
kind of like cyberpunk II type kind of
world and and much like Robocop the
corporations over the police okay but
basically all those laptops are just
gonna be like flavored type things I
don't think there's anything plot
necessary in those now if you want to
get out of building quickly of course
I'm jumping I'm jumping everywhere
should call this game of leapfrog I am
not doing anything okay you could rein
it to at the end of the mission like
violence you didn't you didn't hurt
anybody or kill anybody okay so your
rank is gentlemen nice witnesses nobody
saw you ghost noise you didn't get a low
enough or high enough ranking to get
anything sure and the time it took you
forever so it caused you cold
thoughtful oh okay sure I get you
continue all right good job
Thanks nice and simple yeah our feeds
are backed up at four more facilities
the other slightly better garden but
nothing too taxing I'll give you the
addresses in order of security it's
frankly I have no idea how good you are
oh fuck you bitch okay you can skip all
these stupid just by going back alright
so let's do that
skip cutscenes everyone take a drink I
like some of the dialogue though you're
a mess okay okay
oh wait neither the shop I can't afford
nothing bitch ends when you like you're
doing the tutorial stuff right now next
the next mission is how to deal with
with guards okay okay oh where am I I'm
over here I'm very tan you jump over it
no move your muscle my own you see how
it's white oh okay I see that you see
that cop there you don't move the mouse
in front of the copper he's looking see
how it's red mm-hmm that's the red is
what he can see before you move into an
area if you want to like start it out
I see you see what they can see before
you you jump in and get noticed sure cuz
when they shoot they shoot quick you
don't gonna have time to dodge
everything so I see you it's like
instant death no okay righto so you if
you jump are you go here and it's not
that no cuz he's looking the other way
hahaha video game logic yes
great okay so now I jump on and jump on
him
but punch it only takes one punch what
you're doing is fine - that's probably
okay okay okay you can stop not do it
Jesus Christ wait you just doing this to
see if there's any more messages because
that is among the worst reasons to punch
someone in the face on it and and I mean
now I just want to keep punching yes
yeah he's gonna you guys this is now
punch a face punch simulator that's all
playing he's he's dead by the way you
only need to punch him lunch to knock
them out if you punch them ten times
they die oh really
there's there's some secondary
objectives where you don't want to leave
witnesses anybody who sees you Wow
if you want to get the secondary
objective you have to kill them sure
pork don't be seen in the first place
but I'm just gonna keep right okay is
there is there an achievement for
punching this guy in the face I got I
got one I don't know if it popped up
when I didn't see it but I got one that
said oh Jesus Christ here you go already
it was something along those lines I'm
just gonna keep punching on the face I'm
at almost 400 times is there any reason
in the gameplay that you're so tiny so
you can see the whole map and plan what
you do okay yeah it's very tiny it's so
little you'll see with some of the
larger levels why that's nice alright
cuz what you're doing eventually is
you're rerouting like electrical sockets
like you're taking the light switch
and you move like the input and lights
wish to open a door things like this
you're gonna see what's on the other
side building there's a good reason for
it alright you know I've gotten this far
I'm gonna punch him in the face of okay
sounds everybody do it punches I'm just
punching a guard in the face
but you know Matt's 700 already so it's
the my objective disappointed punches oh
yeah they said this is like the Fight
Club game oh yeah you just punch yes
this is the bailiff fight that's right
this is the best ring you guys just want
to talk for a little bit while I focus
somebody wants you to go to ten thousand
ten function in the face oh you guys I
accidentally jumped off of him oh fuck I
don't know all you had to do is stand
there and click over and over and you
fucked it up that's amazing how far did
you get Jack I wasn't looking I 800 700
so here here here's the deal you got a
garden in that room there's a locked
door between you that's why you can't
see him now if you mouse over like the
game go I guess that stupid things in
the way yeah you can't open those red
doors it's like a handprint thing only
the guards can open those so you gotta
find a way to get him to open the door
right so now you see that little thing
with some weights wait hey hey okay hey
yeah if you can't figure out the
tutorial yeah yeah then I'm in trouble
here in trouble so I haven't even read
what's gone okay a laptop hack copying
clothes great all right
so now liquid that is great Vamsi once
you liked Earl white or something like
that and get their attention they just
start patrolling back and forth oh okay
I'm with you I'm secondly if the
autosave is pretty generous do I just
have to do a crazy fast or is he gonna
and he might see you so be careful you
want to stay near over his head or
behind him got it I gotta get out I'll
get out don't worry about that I get out
I did not know that you could climb on
the fuckin yeah oh yeah monkey you're
like monkey men monkey man with bullfrog
pants that's what they call me
Hey yeah jump no that way
oh you son of a bitch violence
yay for violence Peter alright upgrade
yeah I just want to jump higher now I
guess maybe I'll jump I don't want a
bullfrog cuz fuck it can change it at
any time Jack yeah Stu it's too generous
if you ask me now rewire electric
devices I'll probably need that yeah it
doesn't that matter crosslink oh you
need you need to crush link that's
you're gonna be using that old game this
is where like the real game starts in
with the crosslink okay this is where
you doing that's what you still do the
ReWalk rewiring shit so do I need it yet
no you need before you get it okay great
alright let's go next weekend good I
don't care about any of crap you say
lady I'm sorry
alright now to use the crosslink yeah
move the mouse wheel to scroll okay you
sit on light switch yeah click on dragon
see the door that's red red red things
you can interact with other red things
so yeah like move that to the door up
top it can't see that doors locked now
use the switch oh I get it yeah awesome
fun
also you can knock out guards with doors
by having the doors open in their face
what yeah that's fun
this laptop back having closed you're
not reading anyway the window cuz I was
supposed to do him there's a window and
he always jump
let's go okay
I know don't tell me anything right so
I'm gonna figure this one out yeah yeah
I'm just I'm just diving look this isn't
like XCOM crazy-rich okay Mike I'm
flamed you're doing everything wrong
because you were doing everything good
this is my back but that's how you learn
you make mistakes and then you learn by
climbing in front of that guy's light
aside you got shot yeah basic basic
learning French hey guys I got another
guard Wow
oh my god so I decided not to do it but
that's really funny so nice music to
point it out if you look at the garden
in this view in the blue view you see
those dotted lines the white ones yeah
that's their of their vision range so
you know which way they're looking so
he's facing that door so if you come up
the stairs yeah we'll probably see you
right away
right you know what I'm with ya
little seal the white thing that goes
down you've got connected the wrong way
you got the door going into the switch
let's switch going into the door oh
you're doing some kind of crazy feedback
thing too cuz you're having to go to the
door and the doors oh the switch
connected to that there we go
that's what I wanted to do I killed him
i electrocuted that guy can I punch him
in the face now um no no god damn it
this game sucks and well let me punch
cards in the face nearly as often as I'd
like is there a game called face punch
complaints punch you you can't you can't
set up that door so it opens the other
way and the garden knock himself out
when he tries to open the door there's
no level there's not wondering every
level okay
I thought you said there was I like I
said most yeah I said if I could say
every applicants walk come on turn out
the lights again
oh wait I forgot this one there's a game
called kickpuncher isn't that from
community yeah I think that's that's a
Libyan community called kickpuncher
sometimes people take fake things and
make them into real things no that's
weird
fit make make fake premises and make
them into real video games
yes that's weird hey Tony veloute to
Jack I allude I've alluded to a lot
tonight I don't know if people realize
all I got way to do but that's all right
hey everybody I'm gonna take a little
break and let's go ahead to the chatty
oh yeah I'm sorry
oh hey Jays gonna take over at our
kitchen Oh am i you're so okay cuz rich
isn't here alright so guys how are all
of you how are all 500 of you hey ah
there's a new best of the worst coming
soon it's being edited at the moment and
one of the movies that we do for it we
had never heard of before but
immediately after doing the episode I
discovered that it's on Netflix right
now should I say what it is I mean I
guess it doesn't matter it's called
chochmah yeah if nothing else watched
the trailer for it on YouTube because
it's an amazing trailer and quite
possibly later this week you'll have the
new preview second quarter
oh great why everyone that's an
exclusive even I didn't know that yeah
almost time I was just adding graphics
one twitch right now
when it's the sequel to pork pork in
space they only the farthest that ever
got was a title I had a title for my
short film pork Parkin space and the
title was going to be pork pork in space
in space the movie itself went into
space but I don't think that'll ever
that's a novel idea I don't think
that'll ever come to pass the music at
the start of each Plinkett review is just
generic stock music you guys I noticed
you fast that several times I wish I had
a more exciting answer for you but
that's it
it's we have a library of music and
that's one of the tricks it's
cost-effective mm-hmm we use it
sometimes for Half in the Bag to carry my
authorized to play this game while
you're screwing room probably not I got
a second yeah okay Wow I was I was
logging Jane what were you doing to me
how did I not notice this so what does
everybody think of that new Nicki Minaj
song yeah I heard it today it's just the
worst the worst thing was doing good
booth it wasn't a good function um
retirement turnarounds fucking Ninja
Turtle movie or Amazing Spider Man I
want to be positive
okay what it easy that's good or listen
to or whatever nothing absolutely I've
been watching some Penn & Teller's
bullshit
oh yeah that's a fun show okay I never
watched it shouldn't I be able to jump
and kill this guy
well that windows somehow you really
can't get through it
yeah it's like you go through the window
when your momentum is the highest but I
can hear the top of your jump you you
slow down I can get through it you get
you could probably you know successfully
jump through a second-story window yeah
and kill yeah okay Nicki Minaj let's
talk about making another somewhere oh
it's someone s about the movie blue ruin
I haven't washed it yet but I want to
that's my my review I haven't seen it a
fan tennis I did just watch only lovers
left alive jim jarmusch his new movie
and it was really good I took I took the
non-lethal approach myself but during
the same window that's pretty deep fuck
it I'm a terrible spy now people are
gonna think they're gay lovers
oh now he's looking this way
cuz you made a noise jumping out the
window alert him I did it yeah
oh but the doors closed oh okay
that's not good yeah the elevator dings
he'll turn around again oh it doesn't
Dan yet fuck that fuck that thing in
fuck oh you know what I got this fuck
yeah you know for ever again I forget
lot of you fucks together I got the know
that that dumb there underneath that
button that's not electrical socket yeah
do you put power to that like if you
activate that it's like it'll well the
guard standing over it it'll get me
shocked yeah I killed that guy with that
oh that's right you did okay okay so I
guess so Dom hey what movies have you
ever walked out on have any of you ever
walked out of the movie desperately
wanted to walk out of Attack of the
Clones desperately but the person who
got me in free was there then it would
have been highly rude what about Revenge
of the Sith I think that one was
probably easier to sit that was easier
to sit there than attack the clubs
yeah it's nothing I didn't walk out on
it either or we would have missed the
the most amazing moments in any of our
experiences in the theater
yes misguidedly my dad took me to see
what was the movie with Rosie O'Donnell
and Dan Aykroyd whoever they went to
like the vid no you've totally other
things to eat an exit to eat him dan
Aykroyd and Rosie O'Donnell went to a
fetish sex Island that's the movie and
my dad took me to see that movie because
it was like oh you like movies it's a
comedy and I didn't know anything about
dan Aykroyd sure and we had to walk out
halfway through because people were
spanking each other yeah all things S&M;
outfits a boner Jodi and I want to say
that the book that it's based on was
written by
and rice I could be wrong about that but
I want to say that yeah I believe it I
don't think I've ever walked out on a
movie I walked out on wild wild West's
it wasn't it wasn't an affair it was
when I was living in the dorms during my
college days and they would have movie
nights the main floor and I walked out
of that movie but never in a theater I
wanted to walk out Godzilla not the new
one the 98 one but as their my little
brother and he liked it Nina
he just any regular switch can activate
it here's this which there's not some
switch on this level here's a switch
okay I got this you got a good bond I'm
dead no oh come here because it keeps
calling the elevator down you can't get
in not so who keeps kept you have to
turn off one of the connections but I
want to make sure he's still dead
you can stay dead very good there yeah
he's cuz they did good night eyes in it
I killed ever it's gonna go back up in
English you got that elevator link to
the top one of us and every time you get
to the bottom it activates the one to go
up top just put it into itself it'll
turn off yeah
Oh hacking hack I don't know what's
wrong with you jack I got all this stuff
right away uh-huh
I can't really easily to me well do you
but you didn't kill the guards like I
did we know I still only got around the
guards oh wait wait forgot what what did
you forget we have two laptop okay great
got it
get out of here we as long as I keep
falling and splattering like that
the guy that keeps asking about the
Plinkett music I have no sufficient
answers for you I'm so sorry we it stock
music its stock music we have many
libraries since they've come from many
different sources please please stop
asking the question is now been answered
twice please stop asking and spamming
the chat Omega and that call yeah
don't with your business and yes please
send us more new keys we do it all for
the new key you guys we need like maybe
three or four more new keys before and
then we have we have a plan what do you
have a plan three or four hundred yeah
we need many more knows you know just I
know what I want to do with them but
nobody else agrees with I know I know
what I would do we have multiple ideas
on what to do with all of our new keys
and someday we will utilize them I've
actually seen new key nobody else here
has I saw it when it first came out on
video it may be the first movie I
enjoyed ironic you you would say it's
worse than Nick and me yo god yes god oh
god yes I even I despise Mac admit I
despise it it'll be your favorite movie
after watching new key oh yeah I'm
looking forward to that one
great she's just taken the rent for the
murder
oh by the way I typed I typed got it I
was not paying attention I did watch
Snooky before it was cool you're right
I'm a new hipster only did you skip the
chat I'll summarize it she's she's a
jail for the murder that's mine
brown black trenchcoat committed okay
that you erased all the security tapes
for prove that she wasn't there
gotcha save your own ass and now you're
trying to ease ease drop on that guy in
the top story to see what he knows about
it is he's this corporate guy so a
little square area by the door just need
to get there okay now here's where you
bought the different devices the
upgrading crosslink yeah you can you can
automatically with level starts anything
red you can play around with right Oh
green green items you need to get to
that that switch box on the bottom
corner before you can utilize green
circuits so you need you need to get
access okay so you need to get green
little green cameras attached to the
door so the camera sees you the door
will open you only need an attached
going one way it's now attached at all
now the door won't open
what the fuck what the fuck is he has
what do you think of the game jack
that's fine
fun and not everything you were hoping
for no no I was willing you know but
we're still tutorials obviously which is
actually part of the problem dad I love
it it's a simple women it's not as
complicated as I'd like yet I've done a
lot of the same kind of things over and
over
yeah but but I enjoy this game
how is production on space cop going
that we're getting there
we're getting there we got about five
percent of the movie done yeah so we
estimated it'll be another five six
years and then we'll be at least on
shooting well we got the hard stuff well
the second hardest stuff out of the way
no I would say the hardest stuff it's 5%
oh yeah we're still doing a thing
no we've got a fair amount done uh we
shot some stuff last week regimes and
stuff next week so we'll see we would
like to have it done by the end of the
year but we'll see
you watch me have no idea what I'm doing
it's not the most difficult thing it's
not well just because you're smart
doesn't mean the rest of us are it's a
door is that I just sit up to the
switches that's not door that's
emotional you go from there and
activates things or her guard walks
through one of those and activates
things oh well let's see and that's it
no it's an archway so if you hook that
up the door and walk through it the door
would open but when you go back through
hack it got it see it looks like a door
I'm pretty sure I understand I probably
should have been paying attention to the
channel Lemos you mouse-over you read
what it says it'll tell you what it is
well the CGI in space got to be better
than an asylum movie there will be very
little CGI in space cop we're trying to
give a lot of practical stuff
there's probably switch place your
subjects where I could read the chip oh
sure I think that's a final yeah yeah
okay I'm playing y'all riches just remit
your chat send rich your love you chat
love you Jimmy James Jimmy James anymore
do you say that any more than I do or is
it all of your system at this point
mostly out of my system okay i whenever
i reached for a word that i don't know
what it is I just say jam that I'm
saying something like um or like I see
which I feel is more appropriate than I
more like so we did another commentary
track at any point yeah there will be
more commentary tracks we got some ideas
we don't have his time no we plan on
doing some more sometime soon okay great
talking about the one that just never
works every time we try oh yeah we've
tried Howard the Duck multiple times
Late Late twice yeah better once normal
and it was just too boring
you run out of stuff to talk about cuz
the movies bad in a really generic way
so you just run out of things to say
yeah so so we tried with you and my
drunk we tried an experiment and I got
that was the night if anyone ever saw
our Twitter we were tweeting at Ryan
Gosling to be in space cup that was that
night that was that was drunk J that was
yeah that well it was Jesse instigator
he told me to start tweeting that Ryan
Gosling and he never responded but yeah
that was that was just a mess we're like
well maybe it'll be funny if it's a mess
but it wasn't funny so multiple times
we've tried to do how are the duck and
it's just never work if you can't beat
that movie it's a generic it's too
generic yeah
and any complaints or anything you can
make fun of it gets old after the first
20 minutes or so there's nothing left do
you think Marvel will will make because
everyone thinks of the teaser at the end
of guardians the galaxy means it's gonna
be Howard the Duck moving out
you know I think they will I saw it as a
joke but apparently the voice of Howard
and that was Seth Green so if they're
gonna go out of your way that casts like
a real actor in the part maybe I don't
know yeah unless Green just wanted a fun
cameo in a bank any friends with James
Gunn all I know is I don't care either
way if they want to make it they can go
ahead and make it they're all obviously
opening up to the weirder stuff at this
point I wouldn't mind seeing them try
enough time has passed since the debacle
from the eighties why not for one I
don't hate the movie as much as
everybody else does for another thing I
actually really like the original with
Steve Gerber written comics yeah yeah
well they're really smart ass right
satirical yeah yeah that would be hard
for them to do a movie that actually
captures that cuz that would be in a
completely different tone than the the
rest of the Marvel stuff even something
like guardians of the galaxy you just
love killing those guys too there's no
way they're my where it
all right yes I do think there will be a
doctor stranger there are yeah yeah
they've already announced that get to
get what they will get with the times
yeah they're already basically wasn't
Doctor Strange movie called doctor
Mordred but charles ban he had the
rights to dr. strange but they elapsed
and then he just made the movie anyway
and change the character's name marbles
marbles Don the standard superhero stuff
yeah and they just recently did the
space aspects of the Marvel Universe and
guardians the galaxy yeah and now they
have to introduce all the mystical shit
and that's gonna be done with Doctor
Strange
but apparently James Kiehl dunks it on
Twitter that it was just a joke okay
well there's your answer okay
they probably will at some point anyway
though even if you mentioned as a joke I
have a feeling someday there will be
another Holika duck I think we're going
to watch it
I think I think a ballsy director but
see that as a chimp oh sure why not
yeah
Richard would you like cast as dr.
strange I don't know anything about the
character sign okay hey I have given
this literally zero thought okay
fuck it George Clooney why not just yeah
all right
he can do anything he can do anything as
long as it's George Clooney
figured it out rich yeah figure it out I
did it you did the thing I did there are
things I need of you I killed two people
congratulations I really liked the
killing the people part did you know you
had the punch in the face oh I got the
psychopath
is the only way you could people in this
game you just punch up enough but are
you pretty great well once you get
enough money you can buy the gun oh my
gosh look that's punching him some more
fun punching news
play punch them to death is great
punches it this you can also you can
even hold people at gunpoint like you
pull the gun on them and they turn
around they see you and they won't move
you can get them like back up okay I'll
get them back up into my fist as a
vitamin you can probably just shoot them
right away and that's fine too
okay good see this one let's see what
this guy has to say who the fuck are you
fuck you I'm starting the mission I
don't even know who you are
oh this this great little light-hearted
and wash story I'm sure all gone with
the wind fuck it I'm good game time just
a jack and jump on people and keep
clicking on okay punch you in the face
it's like a point cook adventure where
my fist is the pointer and their faces
the adventure we're in the full-on game
now hmm let's do that
oh here we go bulky guards aren't
forcers enforcers can't be pinned down
or bashed ha so I can't jump on them and
function in the face no jumping out to
the side like electrocute them and right
stop oh so I actually have to use my
brains or they could fall like that trap
door right there oh my god why would you
build a trap door and I guess are dumb
people aren't dumb
Wow you know a game is boring when
people are clamoring to see papers
please we're gonna do that one we've
only been out for 45 minutes for your
your game is boring when people would
rather watch a game that is literally
just double-checking paperwork
do-do-do-do-do-do
okay let's see what's going on here all
right
but then I need to make some noise
getting along I don't even own a system
that can play Metal Gear 5 let alone the
fact that I'm not particularly
interested in it so that's the most
recent one
yeah we'll be oh it's not out yet I
don't think so I could be wrong I'm not
I'm not a huge Mel gear fan
I don't help think convoluted the
storytelling makes for good storytelling
and some at some point metal geared to
the possessed hand of the main
characters dead brother possesses
another sure turn okay this evil twin
clone brother somebody else who kind of
tell the real time driving simulator no
I've heard of that yeah Brandes draw a
bus from like Vegas is somewhere else
the desert and the bus the bus works you
have to keep any assignments off so you
have to constantly hold down the key a
little bit yeah to stay on the road I've
actually heard about and takes like like
five hours several hours I think that's
wonderful
do you people think that would be more
exciting the stream than gunpoint can
you play that online somewhere is there
an Idolator for it probably that's from
like a cd-rom game right
originally I don't know that I think it
is I think it's like there's like three
mini-games on it and I'd have one of
them I doubt it so fancy that you can't
download quickly are you sure this game
is bad or maybe Jack just sucks at the
game I'm doing a great job I don't know
what you're talking about
what are you doing it was starting on it
what are you doing what's your plan
what's going on here jack
it's I mean yeah you hold that door but
you gotta get down to it yeah oh yeah
yes time is a factor Jack I didn't know
okay wait I see okay I see I see I see
what's going on okay so first of all we
take this switch and we say fuck it get
up and then we go from the camera to the
door hey go we use this game a bit more
interesting I think this is to watch
stream every time I look you're doing
what your strategy is what's is it or do
people just want to hear us talk about
bullsh a wall is something plays in the
background a balance of both let's give
a bounce well you talk about the game
I'm gonna go make a Jack and Coke
hey boy I never knew Jack and Coke but
what a reason I was feeling the taste
for it today
all right Jays gonna get drunk everybody
just want just one we'll see how long
okay people saying this game is bad that
makes me sad
it's I like this game it's very
straightforward if that is a proper one
sure that we're I think this is actually
something that you said earlier where
there's not really enough variety in the
way you're gonna tackle problems this is
the thing yeah and so all you feel like
you're doing is exactly what the
developer like you're you are following
the exact path that the developer wanted
you to follow and so they're like it
lacks that spark you're not you're not
playing it by the seat of your pants and
improv it right yeah you're not just
using the mechanics to figure it out on
your own you're just following the steps
I still think this game is worth
existing it is it's you know what the
art style is really nice the music's
been great Brooke I brought you to
upgrade some stuff but fuck it what does
PlayStation 2 night gonna happen well we
already get it you missed it we had it
it's done it so it's over what so long
thank you thank you for playing that'll
be all you missed a great night and it's
gone forever what are you even talking
about the PlayStation 2 games oh yes a
game station no no no no we did it we
did all the game stations okay so here's
what I'm doing guys so this is a motion
door every time a guard logs through it
right it'll trigger some right only red
mix all there are things so here's
another door so if I do that it should
open the door so this guard can walk
through this one and trigger the green
thing
and then when he triggers the green
thing at all open this door so the other
guard can walk through this door to
trigger the yellow wanna fuck she's all
the desert postgame is online someone
just posted the link to it I'm gonna
copy paste that and maybe we'll save for
later you never got to play that one
chance game either oh yeah that's a plus
yes that's great
you're hoping the runway yeah I know I
needed to rework the way it goes like
the timings off oh you're s oh that's
not gonna work because the switches in
every door there you go Hey now our
timings gonna be up again well you can D
connect it must open oh yeah yeah that
is a good thing to know
okay great that's T connected batson
you'd also theoretically trap them in
there - oh that's right good idea
it's too late now is it yeah maybe next
phase okay you're probably right no they
tried a second forget it I got it okay
maybe no he's no way he's getting back
of time I'm sorry Jim
yeah I know oh my wait okay no I took my
magazine hits the wall
racetrack great see things are going on
that wasn't this more interesting it is
but like I said you know like I said the
solution to this was rather simple yeah
of course we're still here on my loved
ones but it doesn't have that hook you
know
the portal hook if you will the old
portal hook
all right at this guy in here that's
just a lot of waiting - waiting for this
guy to get into this doors - goodness so
I can shut the door and do the finger
thing
okay great so now in the orange room Oh
II guess it's tough to do with the
orange room here that there is an alarm
I don't know if you've seen in the Lamia
this Oh Betsy yeah that's an alarm yes
yeah let's hook up for the camera
well
Decepticon so you ready
wait there's a game called don't shit
your pants really real job oh my god
that didn't work out too well Jack that
did not work out as well as I wanted it
to got to be careful on that top floor
guy I wasn't paying any attention to
don't shit your pants a survival horror
game that sounds great is a screamer oh
I don't know I probably just googled it
well you ever see the scary maze game no
it's it's yeah this is a screamer
disguised as a game just like a maze you
use the mouse to give the cursor to get
through the game if you hit a wall with
the mouse you like start over okay so
first you are pretty simple
yeah but I'm this last one that the
narrows pretty pretty and then they'll
pack weighs pretty narrow so you got to
be really careful with the mouse getting
through okay and once you get through it
triggers of Linda Blair Springer so
you're yellow you're really paying
attention tonight at the walls you're
really focused on your screen
I think anyone that uses a screamer is
an asshole
it's a cheap tactic you should never do
it
people are saying it's not a screamer
but I don't know if we can trust
oh no we can't what if after shopping
the dialer he can shoot me from down
there if he's got a lot of sight on you
oh yeah so we'll just mention the cannon
films documentary I don't think it's out
yet I really want to see it bill
are you are you just about done Jay with
the game yeah I mean maybe whoa
whatever happened to that Fantastic Four
documentary oh yeah that was a doomed
I do mad I don't know when it comes out
who's this one
you get that green door closing up
doesn't matter doesn't matter I'm out of
here okay can't I hear jack jack was
looking so forward to this game I really
wanted that's the other thing and and
now I think he wants to die no no no I
mean it's still it's a very nice game
it's just expectations right okay
it's I'm a little Desai I was expecting
I was expecting know a little deeper I
was expecting something a little deeper
that's what she said nice thank you I
can place Hey good good job rich I said
yeah maybe if I was taking the time and
reading all the dialogue I appreciate
the story elements in this game myself
maybe maybe
well so that's the thing like maybe if I
was reading the dialogue it would be
different but it's like just as a game
it's like it's fine it's just very very
simple that's in Newark it's if you got
shot but other than that well
alfalfa I'll I'll fix it this time okay
I'm not doing it right
this is my plan I'm sticking to it
don't die Xena will space copy better
than things I don't know if anything is
better than things Dec have you seen
things of course I've seen it is there
any watch that Melissa now thinks is the
worst movie in the world it may be the
worst movie ever made things is God all
things is God awful things it's not even
funny man oh it's so great you say great
I do why it's just so fascinating now
he's trapped in there he ain't got shit
I want you to have bye baby
that's the ADR and things things makes
no goddamn sense
sure does there's a cabin and there's
little creatures that's all you need to
know now it's like a surreal nightmare
yes it is a surreal nightmare I agree
with that it feels you know you have
David Lynch filmmakers like that to try
to make them release capture the the
feeling of a dream or a nightmare no
movie captures it as well as things they
just have to be do it on accident what
is the name of the music video done by
the guy from things Oh road to sadness I
think something to sadness where he's
wearing the kiss makeup
oh that video is amazing too
we have favored elements oh yeah we
favorite ice we do well I'll let you
read them this you're looking so for it
in effect present we will be reading
fake resumes later after this game so
soon how do I get there I see we
as soon as I get down this level then
we'll take a little break I won't come
back and read some fake resumes huh with
you dog
I'll figure it out I already killed two
people
Oh as everyone was hatred for the wheel
the worst and acts or is it legit I
think I'm the only one who hates the
wheel you hate it I mean it's a
crapshoot by design really the wheel the
worst represents life sometimes it's
positive sometimes it's negative but you
can't control it that's true it was only
recently that I found my love for the
wheel outdoors with with SOS so next
time you do want you may hate it again
yes that's the the nature of the wheel
we do play off our hatred for our camera
though like we're disappointed it came
back from the dump I don't share some of
the skits sure when we're actually
watching some of the videos that where
we look miserable we are miserable
that's not fake so I did it right
there's nothing more to do though
all right there yeah you know thing up
there there's a laptop getting good
which is pretty easy to get Oh
I'll be careful when leaving the guy
that's walking around on the floor above
you
yeah he can see through that window so
he might shoot getting your bag on the
way out oh sure just make sure his
backstory
sounds easy shit oh you're done with
this thing's gonna take a while will do
I mean we'll do one more okay I got
upgrades apparently you got it you got
enough money to buy you something the
shop - oh okay sure oh man okay
booby-trap electronics muffled breaking
glass oh that's nice long shot - you can
you can mess with their gums you know
you can try out any of these things
before you buy them - this is really fun
there's a little demo level that's Luke
some incoming shots mix fuck that and
booby trap electronics the resolver the
handgun I want to save up for that look
at that I'm only like a couple no way to
get a handgun okay Oh
just like with rearranging your points -
you can sell anything you buy oh yeah
yeah
gonna get the money back you can try
something now give back later and get a
handgun for the next level oh that's me
oh really
somebody believe that Jay did you
really change your mind on boyhood I but
you know what they may be same as a joke
but I did it's true the most amazing
film that's ever been made by anyone and
Jay what made you come to bang such a
conclusion well I saw that everybody
else was given a positive reviews and I
realized oh I guess I have to oh okay
that's it you know what I guess that's
fair I haven't even seen it I've heard
great things it's everybody loves it and
that's fine you can like it
okay no you don't need to get so mad at
us because we did it's alright it's
alright to have different opinions also
I've heard about the ex-con board game
but can't comment on it because I know
nothing about the game itself so maybe
it'll be good I don't know I hear good
things I hear really good things about
the ex-con board game it does have like
you need a smartphone app to play it
yeah and that's kind of acts as your
commanding officer okay it gives you
time limits on like making decisions
it's it's supposed to if you are an X
camera or a I guess just a board gamer
in general I it's supposed to be good I
can't have enough cuz I don't have a
phone that can handle apps I have a dumb
phone I use my phone for phone calls
what that's madness that sounds dumb you
know you can do but see that the green
dorm for the garden yeah you could set
it up so it opens in his face if the
door opens away from the side with the
button so away from the Sun yeah so you
decide away from him hook that up at the
door he's gonna knock himself up hook
that side up go back into the special
mission now we're gonna no no no he's
gonna do themselves wait we're gonna set
aside let's really doing some clever
shit okay
no don't don't do that switch off okay
hook at the door back up normally on
that side okay then the switch on his
side yeah hook up with a switch on the
side that will get him in the face like
this yes
okay now you turn off the room the light
in the room next to him he'll go to turn
the light back on but you can't you
don't have the color for ya
so when he goes to turn the light back
on he's gonna hit himself in the face
right oh hey you gotta let me in no dawg
when I used to switched
that's really funny so he's knocked out
now he's my god so I can probably you
didn't have to punch him in the face at
all
and he does not tell ya I say what's the
point if you can't punch everybody in
the face punch them to death in the face
in the face wasn't the door thing more
clever and fun no did you did you like
Michael Bay's transformer movie did you
but you know what I did like a rock the
rocks a great movie I haven't seen since
high school I remember liking it now
yeah that's all if I saw Michael Bay
film that I enjoyed I would admit to it
no I just hate him for the station 89 no
there's like you know what bad boys and
bad boys too is some of the best dump
fund you could ever have I've never seen
either of those oh you haven't no
fucking great I don't know I've seen the
trailer or the second one I don't know
if I could sit through it but I watch it
that's some good shit right not my type
of movie but I haven't seen inside a
moment I need to do in here
I don't remember what your objective was
but is there a way we can oh you're
gonna get those at camera did you get
the camera if you didn't climb up the
wall to grab my camera you didn't get
the camera top the other you their story
room top oh right that's the best of the
the the very first building you go in
when you like fall out of your yep
you're going back to get the camera that
you triggered the first summer up oh
that's funny yep if only these buildings
were a little more distinct and I would
know that that's a fair criticism also
chap I cannot laugh on command it's my
actual laugh it doesn't work that way I
need to be made to laugh so you fuckers
better come up with some disturbing shit
after this break cuz we're gonna take a
break we're gonna go back to our lovely

oh do I take her to work and see if
there's a cure ya know might not be her
Joey just hang out in the park and die
together it's a tough choice this is a
tough choice this you know what this
choice will say a lot about you as a
person not necessarily I bet if this
were real life I would react differently
but for the sake of the game I'm gonna
try and save the world here yeah we're
gonna go to work so Molly so if this
were a game you wouldn't try to save the
world
well I don't know Jays also not a
scientist sir
oh I'm not a scientist what if she has
there something in her blood that'll up
dead person sorry on the roof that's a
corn on our back I blues brains out my
god can you throw Molly uh-huh now
nothing up here all right let's go to
the lab we probably should have gone to
the park but oh well Molly look at the
dead people
oh my god you get one chance does that
mean you blow it already no this is the
last day okay
oh I'm walking slower and I'm not even
putting on my sock are you greater too
or is that just me no I think I'm the
same oh she's coming with me again
good this is their second chance to go
to the park probably no God no I'm sure
it's something different today what does
the chant think of my decisions so far
good sweeten they seem okay with it
somebody get rid of that car that
Michelle there here's the real one so so
either spend some time with her or what
if today's the day that you figure out
the cure yeah what if Molly helps me
with the cure somehow or what if you go
to the park and realize that not going
to work
is how you you save everyone how would
that happen though what if what if I
them it's the machines that you're
working on there causing keep them on
I've never played I've never put I've no
idea what's going oh this is a tough
decision
fuck it I'm going to work and keep
alright oh all I doesn't want to see the
Dolly's done yeah she's done it for her
somebody got rid of the bodies unless
their cells are just dissolving from
though that could be how other there
can you okay
let's warm up I'm done for the whole
game is just me slowly hi oh that's
amazing
you wanted to do more game I gave it to
this is great and I can't do anything
yet I'm just sitting there dying is that
it something I haven't right I'm not
sure it's not letting me do anything
is this the end of the game
hey I think this is it you just have to
sit here and be dead
are you dead
oh yeah I'm dead just got the music
keeps playing you just sit there oh my
god this game is art I like it
this was great you know what Wednesday
what that first day just get four I'm
sure it was if you go every single day
yo really you can save Molly okay it's
just cuz I skipped a good first day yeah
it sounds about right
what's the chat but they're crazy
they're crazy they love it that was
great
I very much enjoyed that a poet bomb I
totally blew it and killed the world
there's another one it's not really
along the same lines this is a web-based

have to do what this says right this
time goes on you'll get more rules so
deny all foreigners yep glory to our our
stars got our Stiltskin okay
oh all right here put that back put that
back that okay this whole area on your
right the brown background area yeah
that's your actual desktop okay this is
on the left that's assumed out version
there's things you can play around with
that I pull that out like click on that
pull it up
that's your rule book move that over to
your desk oh you can flip through the
pages basic rules
it starts off pretty easy I trimmed his
how to make sure everybody's got a
passport and you got to make sure it go
back Oh
make sure they are a are stowed skin the
citizen okay that's it our only our sole
skins with a passport can come through
and we are where are we first goes our
store scale arstotzka okay cuz you're
fucking country man fucking I'm loving
I'm wondering then you get you can flip
through the pages or multiple pages
screen keeps flickering by the way on
the stream looks fine from here well now
it's not but everyone's all starts
flickering see if it don't cut again
that's weird
there are other things on here doing
enough where it's annoying but I was not
doing it so I don't know well nobler
goes there look at that you see it yeah
I don't know what that is is the correct
thing to say
see like like you have to be like
specific with the pins some of these
aren't gonna come into play until later
days but like you have to make sure they
have like the official stamp from the
country they're from you have to check
the issuing cities oh my it's like it's
like if the are stowed skin it has like
a city for the the grit skin it's it's
the say you know it's forgery and you
can't let those people through okay so
I'm looking for these passports green
with the eagle yeah that's the only
people that can come through today okay
with a passport great
what is this and uh oh I that book this
book get the habit of keeping that on
your desk because later on you're gonna
need to go back to check with that just
to verify information okay Mayers here's
here's how this game works you make more
money what is this - that is a brand on
your desk if you want to does bring up a
desk audio transcript so somebody says
something you can go verify what they
say okay um you make money by letting
more people through or or denying them
properly okay um so it behooves you to
let as many people through as possible
to get money to actually feed your
family okay but then also if you want to
check them properly it takes time so you
kind of gotta balance doing a half-ass
job with making sure people with
forgeries don't get through I like it
okay okay
Green Eagle has a name pay attention to
nationality which has to be our stoltski
arstotzka that's gonna be tough okay
that goes here you think they want stuff
oh boy
yeah I don't think you're gonna have
much of use for the book on this day but
in general open it up open it up doing
it clean I'm not clicking the Hornet
believed anymore flickering uh no okay
notice I am alright see what they got
okay Irish drawers got we have to stab
them through right this stamp thing that
came up here's the thing and it says
Astros guy oh it doesn't have to be
aligned perfectly right I was doing it
again fuck him Joe know what that is
keeper okay hold on can I pause it yep
just it
main menu what's wrong
we're in flickering it's I wonder if
it's a resolution issue so I'll just go
down to not full screen that shouldn't
mess with you guys at all you should be
able to still yeah okay great
well you don't want that big green thing
so just make it a bigger screen area
because big as you can
well no no that's no that fucks with it
yeah I saw it you'll see in a second
you're gonna you're going to watch the
screen a lot of nobody can see the game
being played right this is looking that
bad it's pretty annoying
yeah it splits when I see it over on my
screen - I have no idea why as the is
the real there's no uh there's no
graphics option I got it oh yeah oh yeah
they're all this is that I hold on quick
and X starting over
I got a graphics option when I first
opened it I will I will redo that oh my

Oh favors babysit stopped working yes on
the play papers please

like fun
okay it's not but it's fascinating all
the same that's sounds boring it's
genius that they managed to make a game
about checking paperwork see that sounds
funny in theory but I can imagine
actually playing it works it's strangely
works all right I will have to take your
word for it because I'm never playing it
I think you're gonna watch this game and
you're gonna see these neat things
happen but oh that sounds neat okay see
what happens
like when you have the guards drag
somebody away it's great yeah yeah oh
you can be a douche bag too like you can
you if you want to let somebody through
even though they vent like a forgery huh
if they seem like a sympathetic person
you can let them through anyway but you
lose money Oh like people will come to
you with sob stories good that's great
refresh okay other other people will
offer you bribes
we're getting there Oh
you guys can't see it yet Oh No
everything is broken of course papers

off the rope that's a motherfucking
video game yeah that one's actually
funny all right hold on we're closing

what are you playing it through is it
just its own viola it's well I get a
couple options when I click the play
button I it says play papers please

rendering so I just tried software

playing papers plays so now we're going
to try and launch windowed to see if we
can get rid of this flickering

remember whether or not they'd have to
detain them to get the money I don't
okay
it's been a while since I played this
now and no I have never played Starcraft
I absolutely hate 99% of all realtime
strategy games because they're just
hectic and I don't get much out of it I
like strategy game where you can sit
down and plan your next move casually
not where you're just frantically
clicking on things and it's horribly
stressful
I hate fine games people like that it's
just that for me
DJing dates of birth don't match get the
fuck out of here look at the cold boot I
did okay watch somebody something okay
well yeah they're just catching up
oh it's this guy I am back again best
Sylvester Stallone movie we do we do
mean best as far as genuinely good movie
or best as far as dumb Stallone movie
that's
retaining that so I'm like I'm a casual
gamer because I don't like real-time
strategy games okay fine whatever you
like what you like I like really sorry I
don't like you like I damn what you like
I didn't say nobody should ever play
real-time strategy I just said it's not
for me by saying you didn't you don't
like it that is what you're saying no
rich I guess just like nobody should
like boyhood because we didn't like
boyhood and that clearly were implying
that nobody should best Frank Stallone
movie well that's easy
I'm Terabithia Beverly Hills no contest
I wish there was a better version of
Terra Beverly Hills out there water
sounds right most entertaining Stallone
movie hmm
ah mr. Stallone or Frank Stella
Sylvester Stallone um I don't know
spending a lot of time he's been in a
shitload of movies none of the
Expendables movies I can tell you that
cuz that's gonna be suck one of the
Rambo's I like everything like Cobra
that movie is so stupid and it is every
single 80s action movie cliche jammed
into it I haven't I haven't seen that in
so long Cobra it's it's entertaining I
watched another sort of incorporation
for the screen junkies thing I did about
eighties action movies and yeah it's got
the best depth of the main villain of
any of those movies the only thing I
remember about Cobra is that it was
almost sort of Beverly Hills Cop right
he was attached to Beverly Hills Cop but
he would make it darker oh yeah and that
that movie that he wanted to make and
dobro
I've been item okay is already just a
classic car in the movie and his license
plate is something like I'm awesome
something so stupid sounds great
good guy Jack good guy
I think they approve of your denying him
good somebody else those screaming let
him in let him in haha uh your expired
your expired dog sorry
tonight Oh over the top I mean I've seen
that well I did get a citation for
improperly denying someone yeah yeah but
you know the right thing that it isn't
that a great little thing it is that
this game can produce him on emotion
that I know I would go with rocky as far
as best real movies Rocky's looking
great it was a great movie but if we're
going with just entertaining like dumb
entertaining Stallone movie damn I would
say Cobra no Rocky's a great movie first
blood is a great movie and I like Rocky
Balboa ever called Rambo to being
entertaining I have it's entertaining
but it's so stupid it's like spits in
the face of everything that first blood
was about oh yeah but we know that yeah
yeah you just watch it is on its own
terms it's it's a fine dumb action movie
I uh I've heard the last one was kill
and I haven't seen it the last one is so
violent it's amazing really yeah it's
really gory is it is it but is it
schlock like the second one or is it
more like first blood it's kind of a
combination of both it seems to think
that it's some sort of more intelligent
movie about like real-world problems but
the gore is so great
and crazy so it kind of it kept is a mix
of the two come on what happened Jack
there's another terrorist attack that
ruined your mojo someone I let in
detonated a bomb the sudden went in or
someone just walking by I think it was
someone I let in
oh but anyway you be cleared see look
no he killed the gunner he killed the
guards but you know what I made $50 and
now my family's okay so no doesn't
matter to me I'm not your problem
anymore no dancers at Graceland Club
found dead no I stopped him from coming
in you have to get him arrested oh is
that what I have to do think yeah
you click on the the detained button and
then you click on the note she gave you
Oh whoopsie then you get him arrested so
you did the right thing but you kind of
fucked up I could I fucked up yeah
somebody fucked up
if I weren't reading the chat gal WRO
how you perhaps your name the Dolph
Lundgren movie you're thinking of is I
come in peace also known as Dark Angel I
don't know why it has two titles that
one's got two titles the blu-ray release
is called Dark Angel which is I guess
its original title or something but not
it's also called I come in peace I
haven't seen that since it was on cable
but I have to see of his because I I
liked it when I was young yeah Masters
of the Universe we got it out there I
know I know
very bad I liked it when I was young
going everyone says it's terrible
so well it's the classic 80s like we're
trying to save on money we don't have a
budget so they just go to earth they
just go to Babbo here's my question then
is it genuinely bad or people just
pissed off they're not in Eternia they
didn't have the budget for that often I
haven't seen in a long time but I want
to say it's bad okay I want to say it's
actually
but I don't remember it ever watch it
but all colored jeans must be searched a
new rule for the day
ah fuck you uh it was a cult Ian who
blew up the guards oh now she might
block the guards is she from culture
maybe I don't know you've lost all hope
for life because there's someone blew
him up I don't know what to say I say go
to jail is a communist country then I go
in the jail they're going to the gulag
yeah well should have got your numbers

the way
Nico and Kyo okay no don't ever hire me

someone to make like dick and fart jokes
at family gatherings I am your guy but
only family very well are just whenever

thoughts on mr. Mar snacks I know it was
I uh oh god I even I don't know if I've
seen it since the theater I liked it I'd
already join I liked it too ice consumed
like a bomb something I thought yeah I
don't think it did very well but I
remember being weird and funny I mean I
I have a dark sense of humor so I
appreciate it but yeah lots of people
get killed a bedroom yeah I I have to
re-watch it I'm kind of curious to watch
it actually cuz yeah I don't think I've
seen since if theater
I've seen someone recently it's not my
favorite movie ever but I like it yeah
yeah and might be the last decent Tim
Burton movie that's good pressure on the
mountain I think before that bad wood
which is a great movie
I found gender fuck she looked like a
lady look at the a sports a male I don't
know what a sport - at Mill you got to
keep an eye on that guy I'm terrible at

here yeah they send me razors every
month oh it's really great
they're good razors to harrys.com tell
Jackson you nothing will happen I'm
doing a coupon code Jack enter the
coupon code fuck what what are your
thoughts about Robin Williams death well
we're fucking pleased what do you think
our thoughts are yeah it's sad actually
we shot our Ninja Turtle episode
immediately after finding out that he
had died yeah I was kind of weird I was
back there setting up lights and rich
Kevin he said hey Robin Williams died
yeah hey just say I didn't seem quite so
on me hell no I know you didn't but hey
Jay yes then what that's what happened
no it was sad
yeah you know he's done so many
different types of projects like I know
some people don't like him because he's
too manic but that's not everything he
did I mean he's done so many different
things it's not my favorite comedian
stand up like George Carlin or Richard
Pryor no I like more stuff like Richard
but as his movies were quick okay well
some of them coming up yeah okay
world's greatest dad is one of my
favorite comedies of like the last ten
years I actually watched that that night
the night have you can check neither
both on the desk which is maybe a little
more of it because in that movie is
Sutton dies of auto-erotic asphyxiation
but it's a really good movie and he's
really great in it if you don't think
the fingerprints match I didn't really
get a good loan I know I can do the
describe but it came
his name came up okay okay so the
fingerprints - you gotta look at to you
yeah Jesus Christ I'm just a clerk I'm
sorry sorry
that's right now is that it was it was a
super shame like he's never gonna like
what fingerprints not matched her Oh oh
my god I think you guys my family's
dying and I just want to talk about
Robin Williams I'm probably alone in
this one of my favorite movies of his
pop I go really
I love Popeye I haven't seen that since
I was little yeah I just been too long
since I've seen that I just know it blew
my mind when I found out that movie is
directed by Robert Altman what it's a
great pump my movie I think it's not
Netflix right now I'd have to re-watch
it I haven't seen it since I was really
really little that way I think that
might be his first movie but over here
mark it's been a while I think so too
it's been a while since I've seen it but
I've seen it as an adult that I still
liked it I know how do i how do I do a
body scan give me I did give you the
option to know it if you need to it'll
come up yet you're gonna have to do the
discrepancy thing
Richard's confirmed for a horrible taste
Oh but does he like Popeye whatever I am
what I am
oh there you go there you go the Fisher
King the Fisher Kings a great movie yeah
yeah there's lots around William stuff
on Netflix right now the Fisher King is
a great movie but I like Popeye more
that's you can like Popeye bladder I'm
more real weird but you can like it that
that you know things things contour and
is there a rule for the weapon or
contraband in the book that's what you
would click on oh my god you have to do
that
oh my god fuck oh yeah and related to
what we're doing now I found out Robin
Williams as a big video was a big video
game fan yeah his daughter was named
Zelda Azam did you some of them have you
never seen those ads no there's ads
where they talk about it
really sentimental ads yeah they're
really tough to watch the big plays over
together
oh I named my daughter Zelda really yeah
I didn't know I thought that was
interesting
yeah World of Warcraft is apparently
trying to do something really big with
him with his likeness or something
because yeah he was big in the games
community and just you know like the the
hardest part was reading just about like
other comedians like writing about their
depression and how it affects them every
day you'd it was a really tough
oh wait wait no no no no no no no no I
see that you have a hang of it Jack your
name was changed from aleena to a Lina
fuck now no I'm denying your ass I'm not
arresting you how do you know if they
match her you try the discrepancy and
see if it notices anything click on one
of them a arms
matching data okay great
okay well sure fine whatever come on in
I wait wait stop go to the go that blue
paper again no known aliases Oh gotcha
so so Jack are you talking about the
cracked article from a few days ago the
cracked article was a really great read
also for I want to say salon.com
who's the guy that talked about you guys
on the radio
do you remember um Jim Norton Jim Norton
wrote a really great article too for an
online thing well just about just about
depression and how that can lead to
people being comedians and entertainers
it's it's very true and and yeah very
very sad what oh you don't have you
don't fuck basic rules all foreigners ah
come on come on foreigners must have a
thing and there's another thing here Deb
or is your into Kermit here fucking the
dead jerk wasting your time
well it's the days over anyway so I can
just take my time now emigrant forever
and did here to say that I'm immigrating
okay great
now you may as well be extra thorough do
you guys consider yourselves comedians
which is a good question I don't know I
don't know not really
we're just on site yeah we just make
goofy things I do we enjoy visitors also
you consider yourself I consider me a
comedian okay first of all I did comedy
for a long time I make guy works for a
comedy website I try to make jokes I
don't think I know I think I make we
make comedy videos
I enjoy comedy I enjoy making people
laugh but I'm not
that's enough qualified you know the the
question is is your intense to amuse
people like you know it is but my intent
was never to be in front of the camera
I'm in front of the camera out of
necessity
you know it's like my goal is not to be
but even even before you're in front of
the camera like you you know just
thinking of something like pork pork in
space whereas AG that's it's a dark
comedy but that's a comedy piece sure
would you would you call the Farley
brothers comedians sure absolutely
you I just call them cut comedy
directors well you know they're not
stand-up comedians but they are they're
comedians hey yeah I guess it depends
what we consider comedian I don't know I
know I lost my eye I just consider
myself a guy that makes stuff shit
you're an entertainer sure who works
primarily you know if I'm comfortable
calling myself an entertainer
ah that's the guy that makes stuff well
I I consider myself a comedian first our
proper definition is we read letter B
we're ready jack Jacqueline look wear
whatever you think we are look at your
family cold hungry my son is cold see
bacon hungry cold hungry hungry
I lost bacon cups negative 5 I lost 10
points in penalties because I let
assholes through fucking sleep try oh my
god
what do I lose your family will be sent
back to their village Oh No you are
under arrest until your debts are repaid
that's great oh that is great oh I've
never done that it ah and so I lost yeah
that's a great game yes that is a great
game it is ah fuck that that's great
that's really funny let's take a break
and figure out we're gonna do next oh I
do I do I do
um yeah hey guys we're gonna take a
little break that was a really fun run
on favors please down ha ha oh yeah you
didn't get in to the rebels no there's
no there'll be somebody who likes slip
you a piece of paper yeah and there's
like a like a secret code on it I mean
this there's a whole thing that happens
you didn't even get to ha ha ha ha
that's great they offer you a lot of
money to let their people in oh sure
yeah sure
oh man oh that's right we have resumes
oh yeah that's right you want to take a
break and work through those I'll play
the next game and you can read resumes
ok sure that's a good idea so here's the
thing we're going to take like a couple
minute break and then and then we'll
read some resumes so hang out y'all
