Oh fine now what's next it's fine
all right oh we have a capsule or you
want to or on Orion Trail Orion trail
well we have a Wilhelm perfect
yeah I'll full screen obviously there's
young game
just hit escape yeah okay
can you update us in chaddy you're
playing an Orion trail all these things
are allowed how to play the goal of the
game is to explore the oddities of the
Orion trail and reach the next Galaxy
for Starbase click and drag the star map
to move the camera click on the
destination icon to learn more about it
okay at the start of the game you'll
draft a captain and three officers each
person has a set of stats which increase
your chance of success with different
actions in most cases the sum of your
stats is used
sees three three crewmen to do a thing
yeah okay you under this year I'm going
to do this this seems like a you kind of
thing but I didn't get to read half the
shit so let me do this and read the ship
here do this and read the shit you do
this and read the shit restart or sir
main menu
like yeah he's got a hot plate
how do play
the goal of games explore the enemies of
the Orion trail and reach the next
Galaxy for Starbase click and drag the
star map to move the camera click on a
destination I kind of learn more about
it burger town
this shows what you'll get as well as
the difficulty higher threat means
increased room was next side of the game
you'll draft a captain and three offices
this person as a set of stats which
increase decrease okay thanks dad when
will she stand and science step alright
when you make a decision the probability
drive will appear this device displays
all possible outcomes that could happen
to you Oh success failure critical
success critical failure hmm each stat
point will convert failures into
successes and eventually successes are
upgraded to critical successes
sadly critical failures can't be removed
there are four resources to keep track
of any travel running out causes
problems crew food fuel and home of
course yeah I'm just having a bit hurt
and will begin to starve to death
you need to wait for help you'll blow up
seriously running out of resources also
prevents you for picking the options
then you use it alright
oh my god there's so much here
special time for the counter is the away
mission on an away mission you select an
officer to lead an away team of up to
eight red shirts the goal is for the
away team leader to survive until the
very end a weight team leader stance
will upgrade failures to critical
successes this looks great
each red cert well each red shirt will
fill on the from bloody drives good
outcome
hello of a game or Bandito welcome you
can kill one of your red shirts or a
figure on how to play or ryan trade-off
we well I'm sure it's very similar to
Oregon Trail buttons bass do it rich the
Milky Way galaxy a sister galaxy to our
own the Milky Way is nearly identical
Wilke me oh I'm sorry it's the will keep
you a galaxy you know I'm Dyslexic I
assumed I read that incorrectly efforts
to explore this sector have been put off
because it's really annoying to refer to
it by name and gauge but captain it was
got a big Jenai alleyway right right of
course
Jenai alleyway captain leeway is a
daring and confident leader known for
her snap decision making
she will boldly go into the most
dangerous sections of space without any
regard for the consequences
except first officers 711 haha like Cuba
alright well do we want a min/max or do
we want a little bit of every yes well
we might need some attack and I'm gonna
go with her brainwashing by the analog
connect collective now almost fully
reverted lieutenant 11 has been
medically cleared for active duty she
remembers nothing of her previous life
as a Claudia costly as chief engineer
Kyle or principal squid Lovaas and
Dennis class I mean personal loss has
two thumbs up points for bravado
does that count or Dennis class has
science points did we've min/max or did
we spread ourselves ooh
well we already have one attack so I
don't need to worry about attack we're
gonna have a lot of bravado
oh and well you know we already have a
lot of science so look for diplomacy
diplomacy and tactics
this increases everything we have some
of
question is how good is bravado Rivaldo
well we already have three bravado then
four is even better
yeah but then when I go for a cow glory
god dammit okay great
oh we can change the names oh I didn't
know I didn't know I'll just keep going
don't worry about changing names cuz we
didn't change all of them and I think
this is your last time all right all
right don't worry buddy Oh was the last
one you sure about that I thought that
might have been the last one well we
could have some diplomacy or tactics or
tactics we need tactics more than
diplomacy blow everything up that's the
my tactic Colonel bananas alright this
game looks great I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna lie to you mmm-hmm
this looks like it's gonna be a lot of
fun that's a goal oh my god jeez
ripp you're just adding resource yep
pseudo ninja says a friend showed me the
Christmas episode of best of the worst
few nights ago and I inevitably wound up
here Thank You pseudo ninja just wanted
to say riches bit of spontaneous
laughter gets me every time
good stuff it gets us to okay so a
threat level pretty low both are okay
all right Oh pick nebulas sounds fine
great great
I'll be using food and fuel that makes
sense
yo uh oh sorry the young and the
clueless you are called in to handle a
crew drama
apparently tad and Alexis have been
fighting Dakota found out and made her
move on tad
now alexis is a mess and tad has
threatened your teleporter engineers
Skylar beat up dad huh
make a move on Skylar I'm free Alex
she's too good for tad well we can't do
that because we got no diplomacy we're
gonna put on the moves it's time to make
the magic happen
engage oh oh did I get to know I don't
know failure you spot Skylar across the
cafeteria looking fresh could you really
be with someone like that you and Skyler
Skyler might be out of your league
beaming people to and from the surface
of dangerous planets you can't do this
you're not ready oh we lost the bravado
I know we did we lost the bravado point
you know why because we feel rejected
what's the game's name this is a Ryan
trail
you finally reboot your command console
and find that the last seven updates
added over 1500 alien languages to your
translation software whoo new solitaire
two plus one diplomacy all right boom
finally dressed man hell's you and
explains that you have trespassed
through his territory and must pay the
toll oh you reach for your wallet your
first officer explains that he is a
notorious slave trader you put your
wallet down off of yourself as payment
trick the slaver with nutria paste
people the sight of rebellion
we're gonna go for neutral
Oh Oh rich fuck this game so far it has
not been very kind to us I'll say hey
then we lost we lost a lot of food right
there rich yeah I know we did it's a lot
of food oh my god
you've been boarded oh great it's the
inebriated galactic mooch the cop laka
hey Calvin
this is hungry let's go kept the burger
captain all right fail this one too
hey all right
success after lung struggling the cap
laka is zonked out on a table in your
lab your science team extracts pure ship
fuel from his quivering form you soon a
cloud of gas is all that's left
pewds stinks Louanne well we got plenty
of fuel now we just yeah you could use
some food
Oh eat food huh
you're held by an angry vrak your you've
flown into their territory without
permission
morning tradition you must now face the
Iraq captain in a space joust for the
right to pass as an interlocal you made
choose the type of space jiao's that one
- what is them I don't know Oh hull we
lose Hall the other one we lose crew we
have lots of Hull well no we only have

you're gonna go big or go home
you know our walls it'll be great
seriously rockin know what don't want
them looking at this hey by naming a now
extinct animal a safe mode of combat
you've found a loophole if your tool
evil teams litigate on the whole planet
but in the meantime the vrak's let you
pass with the customary offering of food
yes nice one rich nice one doing great
hey Jack I sent you an email moment ago
with a download link to a fan game
called another Metroid to remake try to
send new files but the files were too
big so I hope you even give me okay
thank you epic Jason III will check that
as soon I will check that when I get
email working exact mmm a criminal
feared for his confectionary genius as
much as his evil leader under Baker
plans uses quantum oven to unbale all
pies making him the galaxy's sole
supplier no he demands your fuel for his
plans he refused he threatens to bake
you Oh No
steel chefs at find a way to counter on
baking Wow blast him Wow if we're just
playing the number game we do science
but you know look at the we could lose
stuff we lose let's do it
that hat is truly magnificent it's so
volumous and voluminous voluminous if
you could just steal it from him maybe
it would crush his ego and prevent him
from executing his evil plan you
assemble a team to carry out the head
wear heist engage our first critical win
go successfully swiping the hat from his
head you discover it's actually a
supercomputer that contains all now you
can use all of his evil skills for good
and you have a sweet hat hey I'm
enjoying this
are you enjoying this yeah that's pretty
fun
oh and we got a tactics point yeah yeah
critical fucking win fuck yeah fuck yeah
someone's broadcasting a message here
said of course
Oh two crews sent two crew you sent out
a scouting mission a few days ago have
just reported back that they've been
stranded on a nearby moon without any
food
they've fixed their shuttle but if you
don't send them something to eat they'll
starve to death okay let it speedo with
nutria paste and send the crew to send
your crew the planned trajectory who
manages retrieve the tasty torpedo and a
day later returns to your ship thanks
what's the name of this one I Jenna
genuinely once played this is a Ryan
trail like Oregon Trail but in space
again or a go a regal is pronounced
Origo ever that's these Oregon Trail
sorry this is Orion trailer
Ryan trail the Admiral hell's you asking
for a quick favor
okay can you retrieve the jelly ACK
ambassador from neveress for your ship
is closest he understands if you don't
have time why wouldn't you have time the
planet is just right there several a
team to fetch the Ambassador oh is this
an away mission select a leader
magnets you know we're going with
Colonel bananas for the tactics the team
has heard into a long customs line when
your team finally reaches the booth and
shows their interstellar passports a
stern uniformed hippo clock blinks its
eye at Colonel bananas and booms
anything to declare
we're gonna lie why cause the might
cause extra fuss it's not like the team
knows what's on the nono list for this
planet anyway nope - his Colonel bananas
I'm tapping it hopefully convincing grin
we got nothing okay engage
yes yeah a second HIPAA clop with a
scanner steps forward and scans the team
all good here Malaga axis the customs
agent letting your team through with a
wink nuts curl bernetta stops by the
vending machine before continuing boom
food plus a bravado Oh meet the
ambassador okay
after customs the team meets the jhalak
ambassador it's awkward gel acts are
liquid beings the ambassador is a jar of
pink liquid with eyeballs floating in it
creepy will you escort the jar to High
Command or is this just too weird oh
yeah like the little animation at the
bottom yeah I know that name it's
adorable
oh yeah it's just too big to wait oh
wait no I thought this is the tactics
off option no no we have to offer to
escort the jelly ACK or verify that it's
the Ambassador rich I mean if we're if
we're going Starfleet protocol we should
really verify that it's the ambassador
don't you think all right sir I was just
looking at colors Oh Oh No - one
diplomacy oh well I think we had zero to
begin with him we yeah he had no
diplomacy his tactics yes he's fine
ambassador colonel banana begins yes yes
said a voice echoing through the minds
of the away team I'll get awfully sick
of this yes I'm the liquid ambassador in
a jar get over it awkward
hey we needed to verify like your papers
a badge perhaps moving on
alright the team in the Ambassador are
ready to go one problem it's illegal to
take more than 100 milliliters of liquid
off the plan never spores terrorism
suspicions agency this throws a bit of a
wrench into your mission what will you
do judge the gate sneak the jelly act
through or freeze the ambassador
wait tactics is that sir that's that's
why we brought colonel bananas yeah you
know yeah come bananas knows exactly
what to do they stick the gyro to a crew
members uniform pants and continue
through customs as though nothing is
amiss engage
oh that's still when I think that is the
jar burst in
l-dub dubs pence the next several hours
must be spent wringing the Ambassador
out of the pants into a new jar and the
crew member dies of embarrassment after
being seen in their underwear
I fucking love this I fucking love this
the shuttle the team finds an armed
guard of hip hippo claps surrounding it
and an audit of our customs paperwork
finds that you failed to visit the space
notary for the proper stamp Oh your
leave is denied
proceed to customs immediately demand an
appeal for help with this beam them back
so demand that appeal girl bands quickly
demand an appeal the highest-ranking
hick klopse hippo clumps size and a
squirts the away team to the appeals
line which is even longer than the
customs line denied the away teams
prepares from their customs appeal
Colonel banana steps up to the podium in
front of an appeals committee of three
angry angry hippos who will hear and
rule on the appeal mm-hmm
pretend you don't speak hippo Colonel
bananas turns off their universal
translator shrugs and acts as though
none of the team can understand the
hippo clumps for good measure they start
speaking exclusively in gibberish all
right here we go
Oh
holy moly
that was a close one yeah the hippo in
the middle buzzes for an interpreter
after a brief moment the phone on his
desk rings the interpreter called off
today so your team gets stamped through
on a technicality
someone however is deathly allergic to
the ink that's all right well I mean we
are pretty oh oh shit
trial by combat the team won its custom
is custom appeal but now must obtain a
specific sticker to be affixed to the
shuttle allowing departure from nervous
for space enough cries the Ambassador
telepathically I invoke the trial by
combine
fight the ambassador a jelly ACK who is
liquid life-form in a jar it designates
the away team as his proxy to fight the
good news win and they will finally get
off nervous for the bad news they're
fighting a tag team of fully armed hang
angry hippo collapse shit
at the worst among keyless beam runs
bravely into the fray as the rest of the
team helps each other over the wall of
the arena homunculus beam looks back for
support but by then the team is long
gone
moving on Thank You homunculus beam
finally you deliver the jelly a combated
er to the space station where the
Admiral is there to greet you he thanks
you for your help then reminds you to be
sure you fill out all the away mission
reports cry and fill out more forms or
leave without doing your paperwork gotta
fill out more forms colonel bananas does
what they're supposed to do they hate it
but they do it oh you lost your bravado
I got more tactics nice
when the liquid jelly a cam basa der
returns to his watery planet
he tells tales of your bravery that
inspire young jelly acts several of them
telepathically apply to join your crew
yes
prove the applications are oh they're in
jars we need many crew members and
approve the applications
who cares if they've got no arms or
bodies their jars can be stored and
third easily in a closet and you've just
patted your crew numbers boo oh look you
got plus science too motherfucker yeah
yeah sweet that was a great mission rich
this is a super fun game
Orion trail I'm liking this a lot I
think but rich and I were both concerned
that this was just going to be a
shameless Oregon Trail ripoff yeah but
this is this is something very difficult
in a mug aim play is very different
different enough to be fun you need
bravado to fuck babes who cares about
fucking babes were exploring the galaxy
oh and look a smoking dog a scientist in
the medical Bay tested a new
intelligence serum on his dog the dog
not walks on two legs talks and has
become the most intelligent being on the
ship some people even think the dog
would make a better captain ro troll use
the serum on other pets Commission the
dog a science officer see where the
discovery goes that's we got a shitload
of tactics yeah that's the smart thing
okay consciously optimistic about this
discovery you authorized the science
officer to see just how far this
experiment can be taken tests continue
on the dog and the science officer keeps
you a prize of new developments
I haven't had a critical failure yet
because we haven't doesn't mean we're
gonna yeah I'll take it thrilled to hear
that thee that the dog is also excelling
physically in fact when one of your
galactic Oh the libyans is injured the
dog steps in to help the athletes
leading your team to its first gold
medal in the space realize we got a
bravado that's great it's fine we'll
take it that's the point you know what
that is at the point of space rocks hey
notchback Fierro welcome welcome to this
dream glad you could catch us live fuel
we are playing a Ryan trail are we good
on fuel I don't know what is a lot of
fuel we burned through it like every dot
we burned through like ten fuel and five
food so I'm gonna say we're good on fuel
like I'm more worried about our hull at
the moment button so we want the mystery
yeah see what's the mystery prize it's a
question mark we don't know what it is
yeah good let's see like look we go
through like ten fuel and three food
every dot so sensors indicate and there
is some sort of floating memorial near
vibe your navigator ass if you want to
make the short detour to check it out
Oh lieutenant homunculus being killed
too many kerbals Kerbal space program
reference I think is well the people
died on the away mission too yeah that's
nice gravestone was surrounded by traps
and other defensive mechanisms but you
were able to help with them all know you
learn one weird trick about defensive
maneuvers click here to find out more no
no that was my joke cuz you learned one
weird trick nobody you didn't let me
know when you wanna be 10 yes sir
number three will you mind yes everyone
F to pay our respects to lieutenant
homunculus beam
after making first contact with the
taragan soap I'm reading oh I said oh
they said oh okay like this is getting
good which you return to your personal
shuttle and realized you've lost your
keys Oh your whole life is on that
keychain your comm tag he's the shuttle
yep your mega marts save a lot club key
tag of this is bad
that's the Terrell Rowan's for help
pound on the whole of the shuttle help
ask for help okay
maybe we'll get diplomacy points but you
can't call your crew members or get into
your ship the tarragon's were friendly
during your meeting why not just ask
them for home surely they can relate to
the situation yeah you got six tactic
bonus here rich we're getting lucky
that's great we're getting lucky the
Terrans have an annoying policy of not
getting directly involved in the affairs
of alien species so you're forced to
wait for help
tarragon's are not prohibited from
performing humanitarian aid however so
they at least give you some food good
we'll take food yeah
a blue star has the blues possibly more
crew members rich epic Jason 9000 has a
bad movie challenge for future best of
the worst
a movie called a shark Exorcist alright
well I into it
I like him well let's take a little
break here we've had some tables okay
captain molar says have either of you
seen Jason X I recently saw it holy shit
that movie is horribly fun it's fucking
great it's got some of the same plot as
a alien in the production call it
quality of Babylon flaw v plunge my call
you had mentioned ya previously been
it's good it's fun schlock super slack i
love it i can understand why you hate it
if you're like a huge Friday the 13th
fan I get it I get it but it's just a
fan of schlock I love Jason agreed it's
wonderful
also the Duke of prune says okay rich
maybe the sci-fi in Mass Effect 3 is
worse and the tone is more anime like
but I think I play Mass Effect 4 the
character anime that's what he says but
I play Mass Effect 4 the characters in
Mass Effect 3 has all the characters I
want that juicy chorus meet and Mass
Effect 3 has it Paris is the most
overrated character in the fucking
franchise I would gladly leave him out
of my party
snap-snap dog
I'm glad that you enjoy it I don't like
that it's a series is that effectively
about making your own character and a
thing you're paving your own way through
the universe what are you going to do
what allies are you going to make what
decisions that change the galaxy are you
going to make and three says no no no
now that matters we're following our
linear story all right and that's that's
that's all aside from the ending being a
steaming pile of shit and that's aside
from the the worst fucking plot device
ever to stop the bad guys yeah we found
a thing that will build we don't know
what does but the thing and then what's
the magic wooden thing fucking
everything about that is fucking lame
yeah too cold to hold you get worn from
the ship say I a pipe containing hyper
chilled fuel is about to rupture and
cause damage to the ship the AI
recommends you dump the fuel into space
better trust the a on this one you don't
really feel like replacing damaged fuel
lines today with the presses button you
dump the ice I see offending fuel we
were fine we're still fine oh hello
I'm sorry sexy Robo ladies you're
manufacturing robot MK 41 has
constructed an exact copy of herself she
informs you that she has lots of ideas
and wants to make more friends this
makes you a little uneasy her green eyes
blink at you awaiting your orders we got
a shitload of tactics
defiance I refused to be Mk trails off
as you power her down you examine her
motivator unit closely
she has optimal levels of loyalty and
job satisfaction seems like there's
nothing to worry about you boot her back
up I think it a fail though agitated
that was impolite captain how would you
like it if I ever moved a part of you
you shriek as she reaches out and grips
your headset who what's going to slow
down your day-to-day captaining a bit
that's going to slow down your
day-to-day captaining then yeah alright
you know what fine I'm careful there's
diplomacy
whatever he's a fuck not posted the
Peskin emirates they're always looking
for a whole plating okay we want hull
plating yes we do
you've discovered a Peskin outpost here
in the frontier the fish people are
allied with Galaxy force so you're
certain that they'll be willing to let
you stay here for a while
that's Jatin trade we should rest or
time to leave plus hole is that what HP
you I'm pretty sure yeah
do you want to rest here and recover
some health you'll have to consume some
supplies to do so oh wait wait wait wait
wait no no look heal HP that's a your
your people's HP and you all of your HP
is full oh I can't spare the food yeah
trade the mess hall which is full of
Peskin soldiers eating and relaxing
around the corner you see signs for the
wet requisitions office
trade okay this is just a rest stop
I got nothing I got no credits
how do I get maybe we could sell some
fuel light or so oh I get it and then
bison I get it a lot of food
mr. nickles have we ever thought about
making a game that seems like it'd be
very difficult making
all right great
why do I want to buy hull so much
because I hull is what keeps the ship
together and we're down to seven so you
know I like the hull because it keeps
our ship moving by keeping it together
Oh Oh
do we really min/max it now let's get
some less we might not have tacky we're
not gonna have tackling this is an
option every time
30 food for some for some attack points
or to hold plates for some attack points
food
I mean it's worth it another point
that's another point
well fine food
we'll find food I think so I think we're
fine
I mean we did we played that other game
that was like final Friday the 13th so
if Jay would like to come back for
actual Friday the 13th that would be
great now we'll probably play it give it
a give it a play go we'll see I left
over beefcake cuz I like the whole
because it keeps me from dying in the
vacuum of space yeah yeah I agree
yonder yonder rich says hey bitches I'm
here you're welcome
no your CH whoa B or CH lonely asteroid
tumbles idly through space barren
exterior has no distinguishing marks
except a series of short regular
trenches carved across its surface
you order your navigator to circle on
the asteroid to check it for hostile
entities
nope
whoa hey your instincts proved correct
space pirates are using it as cover but
your tactics allow you to get the drop
on them in an ironic twist you pillage
their ship for paltry supplies and armor
plating take bam bam I get armor in uh
who got some haul up in here boom
take that jerk ass pirates oh I guess
doesn't really matter
well can you check out the ones after it
you know like that it gives you fuel so
you might want to go up there or that
gives you food so we might want to head
that direction we're gonna fuel so yeah
but we're almost out of food eighty for
food oh no crisis during dinner in the
cafeteria you jokingly mentioned how
great you are at dancing suddenly your
first officer is furious yeah well it's
time to prove it I demand you face me in
a dance battle the entire cafeteria
start swooping oh if you're gonna battle
you'll need your crew you fold your arms
and strike a pose within moments your
crew is at your side simultaneously your
first officers crew has assembled
striking their own intimidating poses
the music starts during your quick
powwow
you tell your team to do the robot since
that's your speciality unfortunately
you're first officers dance crew is
literally comprised of mccann ODEs
mechanoids and your team is totally
served your team can't handle the shame
and they throw themselves out of the
ship to explode in the vacuum of space
well that didn't help anyway well
before you floating in the darkness of
space is an ancient carved obelisk
covered in various alien languages the
carved character shift and changing for
your eyes
seems to be made of a very strange
material you learn those languages we're
gonna study the writing ok scientists
study the writing on the obelisk as best
they can you have no idea why the
letters keep changing but it seems to
they're not the root of many languages
in the sector they are the root of many
languages in the very least you now have
a conversation starter nice after
investigating a nebula a number of your
crew becomes ill their skin turns green
and they soon start sprouting tentacles
from everywhere the ship's doctor
recommends quarantine them research a
cure when others see danger you see a
research grant in the making you put
your top scientists on it at once
let me guess we they become tougher
mutant men is that the critical win
scientists identify the illnesses rare
kethu liyan virus they could cure it but
why not improve it instead I called that

range to cover the entire ship and cross
your fingers

arrives just in time to the authorities
to arrest both ships unfortunately you
have to call in some favors to get
released from space jail keep losing
that diplomacy point we can't hold on to
that shit
yeah
there's an outbreak on the ship of mecha
measles and one of your officers has
become infected

floating memorial nearby your navigator

detour to check it out
yes worked out last I'm excited to
discuss the deeper meaning of the
gravestone with your crew you turn
around to find that everyone is looking
at their data pads tapping away you try
to lead the crew with some questions but

up

Gandhi under says play poop in my soup
do it now bitches a lot of bitches talk
tonight no what's going on why is
everybody all bitches tonight what the
fuck is going on from what I can gather
we need oxygen and we need power to do
what survive and so I have to go around
and collect oxygen and power yeah that's
what I'm doing there all right and you
can only rotate or go up and down okay
and I think that's the game this one's
gonna last us a while in it get the
fucking air pocket get both those
fucking air pockets wall in an order
that I see your God I hope there's more
than this I I don't know if there is
kind of killing it at the moment
lower left shows a bearing and range to
something so it's 60 degrees so that's
90 so here
okay can we go back to Orion yeah this
is kind of jarring in that this is the
game this is tonight guy we will we will
go back to Orion trail just not we might
get another secrets agent yeah you don't
know that was a lot of fun oh my god
yeah I'm going down my numbers are going
down around the back of the wall dusters
- no I think this came out before
dusters dusters is interesting oh wait
I'm going up now this looks like some
kind of minigame found on the Nostromo
ah here I get it I get it
wait am I going the wrong way now how do
I know which way I'm going well Rick I
was happy to sign your poster full power
Jack huh full power
give that you get the right bearing and
then just go full fucker but there's no
full power this is just up or down which
would whichever one makes the numbers go
down faster you want more of
oh that's making the numbers go up so
yeah full power the way you need to go
oxygen oxygen you need air
thank you
so keep heading towards the thing okay
and occasionally keep scanning for error
you need our keep scanning here nope
that's not gonna help I know I'm in
danger
oh there's the thing there's the thing
whoa tagging
I like how your cursive uppercase C has
three humps yeah I got an actual hump oh
do you know why I think it's so good I
actually learned in school way back when
I think it was like a little loop on the
top of the e mm-hmm one little thing
they had above the chalkboard so that's
how sure mutate it over time
joy joy wheezes well I play Orion trail
I wait for the next game or the go back
Jack you're skipping Laura the Sun yeah
oh god just do a strawpoll on what what
time jack will give up on this game oh
are you kidding I've already given up on
this game
what what what will be the time when
Jack says that's it person who's closest
wins nothing I no prize
do you know Lisa has a no prize dad no
prize
yeah from when from what mouth from back
in the day so for those who don't know
many people probably many people
probably okay great for those who don't
know a no prize is back in the day you
would write letters to Marvel Comics ask
some questions maybe point out
continuity errors or you know just
generally you know talk to him and
either Stanley or one of the other
writers or one of the other editors
would respond to you in the back of
comic books and if you made a special
enough comment you would get a no prize
and what a no prize is it was an
envelope addressed to you from Marvel
Comics with nothing inside of it yep
that's all was so was there Kyle what
one Lisa a no prize I don't remember it
to them oh god damn it
to be you can't introduce that and not
have a resolve the story that's that's
terrible I wanna I want to say she
pointed out a continuity error yeah in
one of the comics and they go oh yes you
found it but uh what uh what and you
know they responded to her and what fix
it was a time goblins by so alright well
that you know what that one was not
any fun at all do you want to try a
doctor legis off the tiger and the
terror for shits and giggles okay we can
end with dr. lang Gustave okay go up
where's that really dumb looking one
find me a good one yeah let's let's see
how bad this is up update chatty
motherfucker find me a good was all
about the night find me a good one and
it worked we found a good one but just
for the spirit of the night we need to
keep looking find me a good one
loading press Z to jump ah yuck
oh my god
mama
what do I have to do oh they have taken
my mama Wow
okay here we go
press X to advance dialogue oh no it's
time for bed really good night fine good
night you know all my friends get to
stay up much later
well at the ever-lovin fuck
at some point you have to wonder is this
all just a joke
Wow someone made this it's fine you know
rich it's fine someone made this they
wanted to make this to meet it and then
and then okay yeah you know someone what
someone wanted to go ahead and make this
game and they did and you know I'm not
saying they should have made the game
but I'm not saying they shouldn't have
you know like what the value is oh you
know sometimes sometimes I arch art
isn't a hundred percent sometimes you
got to go through a lot of muck this is
a lot of muck to get to the yard
this is hot garbage you're wasting your
lives and my life too by extension
someone else likes the art style it's
different so here's here's the game rich
yeah you've got to get up there and just
fit in the thing but I also control him
and so if I walk if I you know like when
I jump he jumps oh that's a game but
he's on a different wall you see so I
need to get him too you see so there's a
game in here ish
oh that way I don't necessarily know how
to move him you sure you're controlling
them I'm making him jump definitely but
he for some reason he only wants to go
well he stays on the plane you're at it
looks like oh I see I see you go down no
it's all right I'll get him there
does our om want any beanie babies I've
got a lot of them umm no unless am I
very expensive if they're worth $10,000
we'll take your beanie baby you gotta
jump and fall yeah yeah jump jump jump
and go up yes up no that's the wrong
thing to do no this is fun
yeah I did all right so dr. Langham
Vargas's mover to move to Phil's in a
row on a Ryan trail I chose a bad
captain oh I did pretty good
gotta go jet gotta go Jay anyway and
pretty good gotta go Jamie I didn't fail
my first two roles though yeah
Oh it'll be more fun if you weren't
fucking trash and it was it it what
happened I came back here I didn't press
the scape or anything it just went back
here great all right let's go play this
one
play doctor lehnga scoff the tiger and
the terribly cursed emerald a whirlwind
heist options I'm searching for dr.
Lagos cough I'm not typing in the whole
fucking thing cuz it's not gonna be here
anyway okay hit okay we're updating do
you want our graphical quality to be
gold emerald cardboard or copper uh you
know what go go go cover go cardboard
cardboard or make sure this runs good
and somewhere in the mansion is the
original architects model of the house
and grounds great hint use vents to stay
hidden from guards some of these games
are free by the way yes remember most of
these games I got when I donated to
charity and so yeah if they weren't free
they were I'm sure yeah okay so dr. lang
whatever dr. Zelenka scoff the times are
terribly cursed emerald they do have a
point
who is this by oh this is by uh this is
the same team this is the same team that
did the Stanley parable ten something
you might need to hear this shit
when did they make this recently this is
their third game a lot of me the second
one was recent mmm I think more like
back-to-back no I think their second one
was even like a year or so ago I didn't
hear about it until like a few weeks ago
sorry I forgot to tip you today no okay
one second hi so this is so this is a
bit this is a bit awkward I think it's
probably best if we're just really
honest with each other it's the thing is
the game you've just downloaded
somebody's playing it right now so you
can't you can't you can't you can't play
it if you didn't hear that he said the
game you just downloaded you can't play
at the moment because someone else is
playing it anymore
pretty quiet generally sorry turbo
maestro Chesto says rich
do you like poop if not maybe you
haven't had the right kind of poop the
chapel's lot the chant likes all sorts
of poops rich they could suggest the
best poops that they are horrifyingly
certain you will enjoy quiet organized
you should come inside I'll explain just
through here just wanna make sure you
guys are hearing this because if it's
anything like the Stanley Paris family
parable
here's the thing the games live which
makes it impossible to to insert you and
also it
just quite difficult now for you to
leave but I think it's okay I I know I
know what to do I'm gonna try I'm gonna
try and call publicity and liaison so we
should be able to take you to the green
room alright if you just wait here and
yeah we'll be able to get you in all
right let me just let me just find the
number here okay it's ringing somebody
will pick up okay don't worry all right
listen up I don't know why my office
been turned into a shrubbery I really do
it's still ringing I'm going to assume
it's some sort of space issue yeah it's
yeah I guess we've just gone live they
might be oh they hung up
okay okay I'm gonna try that again I'm
so sorry the same people made the stuff
it's not influenced by it it's just made
by I know I know we've both got better
things to be doing with that okay oh I
know what's going on we've got something
of a strike sort of situation emerging
yeah we've we've become quite
understaffed actually you wouldn't mind
doing me a favor would you come through
here
I could really I could I could really
use your help but the thing is our
entire weather department and half the
wildlife crews just up to left before we
could even begin this morning and it's
all super simple it's mostly buttons you
like buttons right and you'll be able to
play the game as soon as whoever is in
there at the moment is finished promise
you'll help oh this is fantastic
okay this way yeah the lighting
department right through here
mmm you're spoiling some of the magic
you know it feels a bit like cheating
but you know it's okay you carry on you
do whatever you need to do no that's
that's miscellaneous interactions we
don't need to go in there so cuz this is
anything like the Stanley parable the
part of the fun of the game that wasn't
adventure okay
so if you could just head down the
stairs trying to get to him get all the
things they have a job the food plenty
of Oh up up again huh
okay all right right first things first
could you bring up the lights thank you
so much cuz you know we kind of feel
playing in the duct pull over
they could die see that lever it sets
the sunset off
oh no that's absolutely not the right
button you just you just made a beeline
for that one huh I think I think we're
okay okay I still need you to pull the
lighting leaver though that would be
ideal
yeah just now it's the bigger one could
you um maybe not do that please there it
goes I'll do a little lights blinking on
in the windows of the mansion and past
the ornamental pomace pretty magical
really okay now we need to attack them
with a tiger
it is a heist game the players playing a
big heist I don't wanna spoil it for you
but it the tigers very important all
right into wildlife
just through the door this is too good
you don't have to be alarmed it's not
it's not a real jungle right this is all
it's so safe we'd usually have someone
else do this but I started striking
right
just pull the lever and let's say
introduce Tiger to the left that door
there's a look there's a far more proper
turn in the room and it's growling
there's an actual tiger in this room an
actual tiger but it's about four feet
away from the button just by the doors
the weather room we just can't leave the
tiger in the level someone else is
playing a game and then you're behind
the scene yes this is something made the
game run the button that is kind of you
know this isn't really a game but it's
interesting well yeah the game isn't the
game like it like in the Stanley parable
the game wasn't like getting to the end
of the level
I would I would argue I enjoyed the
Stanley parable I would argue that as a
walking simulator it's very enjoyable
it's very interesting it is but but
there is a meta game in the Stanley
parable the meta game is to try to get
the narrator to sail the Stanley parable
isn't trying to pretend it's a movie it
is a linear it is a narrative thing but
it's it's doing something you could only
do it a video game right I and I agree
with an interactive medium but there is
a game to the Stanley parable ok presses
again the recovery crew on the moon I
won't they might join the picket
Union or been eaten by a tiger okay I'm
trying to work out where you're going to
be most useful I don't think we have
anybody left in catwalks doing oh we do
oh great Wow believe it
I guess weather control them the doors
just over there
I'm waiting on waiting for this game to
start hasn't been easy though during a
second performance in here fuck it the
whole garden level nothing is well again
the metagame yeah I don't think it is
the summerhouse
all right no no no too much okay we're
good I think uh there's a button below
the fan that's fine why it's gotta be a
medal how much did you do the lightning
this is just something they whipped
together and this is interesting
Oh fun you're expecting a float on
Stanley parable
you're not going again now I think about
it
you've got a picture the building lit up
by these flashes of lightning it's
really imposing massive oh speaking of
the player has apparently entered the
mansion through the Orangery and is
actually wait hang on a second this is
really important behind this door is the
closest to player ever part of the
backstage they'll be right behind a wall
and I don't know what the walls made of
I do know that it's phenomenally cheap
just down the steps that's good that's
the mansion in there the play would have
got here much earlier except they had to
disarm the lasers that sadly put it that
way you do know that would I say
somebody right I mean you and I'm not
being too subtle here I might it's okay
it's okay it was just it was a fun and
unexpected and searing challenge for
them in any case here's what we need to
do the players going to come down the
corridor and call the lift
I want the doors open and they get
inside they're gonna press the down
button when that happens all you have to
do is pull a fever on this side this
lift was always supposed to power itself
obviously is it just hangover from
rehearsals that nobody got around to
replacing besides it's fine it's fine
we've got plenty of time and action no
way eerie comes to your cabin at about I
smacked
wait for me yv press the button to hear
us do it do it now do it prematurely do
it prematurely yeah whatever no pull the
pull the lever pull the leavin hopeless
okay okay okay fine we'll just wait
which is why Joey
no idea what happened there hopefully at
least they're on their way now
actually they're gonna be very busy with
the vault you could start playing in the
grounds we just need to prep some
pyrotechnics for the escape sequence and
then you're good to go
there's a lift to the pyro workshop up
the stairs keep trying to break the game
like this is the Stanley parable just uh
how are you long yes I am that's the
that's my that's look you're expecting
it to be a game it isn't I'm expecting
I'd argue the Stanley parable isn't
either there is there is a there is a
game to the standard we really should
moving it's not it's not a game but
there is there's a meta game oh my god
are you okay do you still have your
ankles I think they in the correct
orientation okay you're okay you do
that's great
and so I'm god I'm so sorry about that
I'm really this is well this is the
weather room isn't it right
okay listen since we can't reach the
lifts of pyro the only way back into the
game is through is through a department
called high-concept miscellaneous
interactions
there's usually a lot of training
involved but I'll talk you through it
it'll be fine
we'll be fine you brace yourself welcome
to miscellaneous interactions this is
the department the controls where they
controls a lot of things lots and unlock
doors interior lights smoke machines
telephone calls actor twos laser lights
bolt guards tranquilizer dart strengths
you know that kind of thing it's all
just done with numbers I don't know why
and and usually the operators got this
big you know usually they know what
they're doing but I've got a manual here
I think we'll get through it all right
in order to get started you're gonna
want to press the number four just go
right ahead the number four should be on
the left hand side don't worry about
that don't worry that's fine I think
that's normal yeah yeah I don't think
that lights a bad sign five seven two
one two okay so what I get there I found
out was the wrong thing that you could
you press nine and then four and then
and then one
what do you use that could have been
very important what did you why did you
oh that's right okay I found the right
instructions all right I need you to
press the number nine let's okay well
let's just assume we've got nine sorted
right okay five and then come on
in these for number two five nine that
sound that I might focus ignore turns
out that that's a very bad alum so I'm
going to need you to just do a 180 right
down the stairs please write down
probably I probably go a bit further
move you really read what is his good is
it straight okay please all right don't
worry don't worry actually do worry a
bit hit seven Oh
then after it there isn't that thing
really I don't think any of this were
supposed to be on please don't do I
think
just the right time
yeah this game needs that right I found
a way to activate the tail play clever
Oh No
when the downpour panel lights up I'm
gonna need you to pull it when it lights
up not before so why is that remaining
that for game dev this when you get a
bad Metacritic rating just you
now see we did we do it I think we did
it the players left the mansion I think
we do I don't think it's supposed to
still be raining but you know hey come
back down the stairs you're down here
you don't need to spend any more time in
this room you can forget about the whole
thing this is it you're done sister
thank you so much thank you so much you
really helped out we couldn't have made
it through it without you we really
couldn't no screw here here we are again
so this is how it's gonna work
you go in there just give me a moment I
will bring the lights up and dr. lang
scoffs the tiger and the terribly curse
emerald enjoy it okay thank you so much
what I'm hoping nope what is another
player you've got to be kidding me I
can't I can't do this again okay this is
really awkward the fact of the matter
wait hang on where are you going right
so look I need to talking okay that's
the lighting room you need to put okay
fine this is wildlife press no hang on
this is that's a there's a tiger in
there there's a tiger in there
we hold
after the fact and see what the lighting
would come in with Tiger would come in
and then working today that little
section would be the bait this was a
complimentary game by girls okay
that's cute I almost think they should
have had you go through the game of
course then you'd see the lighting and
then you'd see the tiger and the weather
yeah yeah I didn't have someone like
have someone else yes and then you could
still hear him talking to someone else
do all the things that you just did yes
yes it was cute
and I'm assuming it did not cost very
much and you gotta feel free from some
kind of charity thing yeah yeah hmm hmm
I have many thoughts on this went on a
little too long I have many thoughts I
thought about that you wanna talk about
okay no I don't I certainly don't rich
okay I will say I will save my thoughts
for a later date
it's free on Steam you go hey look it's
the Twatter do-do-do-do-do-do-do display
capture turn off pool hey look it's the
torture and this has a lot of names on
it because we kept this running from
last stream from last room we're rich
unceremoniously stopped me from playing
inappropriately very appropriately hmm
so this is the time we're waiting for me
to do something like that as a bit no I
was just I was so brain dead from
glitter mitten grow okay that I wanted
to reach a lot like this where we'd like
it just went on a little too long I just
wanted to get to the end and I felt like
we were close yeah yeah all right so

Polar Express technology is the best
that's not creepy at all no one ever
reminded me of do you remember you
remember in the in the special editions
when they added all the extra CG crap
and they added in that scene where Han
Solo was talking to Jabba the Hutt yeah
and it just felt wrong and then he did
that like step over his tail thing and
Han Solo was normal but then like they
didn't actually film him stepping over
his tail so they had to like digitally
blur him speaking of while we're talking
about are you bringing up stepping over
the tail bit in the special edition yeah
I hope
why didn't they just make that a little
floating droid that had a job of the
hologram that he could actually walk
around without doing the awkward hop
over well there was an actor there you
can see gie out that actor if they can
do the kind of shit they were doing bad
it might have been a little bit more
work a little bit more difficult I don't
know I suppose he'd be behind a hologram
so he would look weird as well
listen having when you add characters
having them be a hologram is a very
simple fix for shitty CGI yep we've
talked about this we talked about this
on Wednesday yeah when we were giving
options for grand moff tarkin it's it's
