can you hear me now
can you hear me now
I'm hoping you can hear me to help I
don't know I didn't I was trying to
figure out how we get the microphone to
work I don't know why I wasn't but well
apparently there was an extra option
hidden in there
I mean unannounced REME it's it's a
streaming day
it's Wednesday we stream on Wednesday
I'm just starting early
all right here's here's here's what's
going on I am playing blood-borne I've
been playing blood-borne this run for a
few days I have not I've died you know a
number of times because it's blood-borne
but I've never failed to retrieve my
blood echoes so that's something we can
watch out for yes Jack Jack said Oh Jack
said no streaming tonight because he
wasn't free tonight but then I just I
dragged my police station for into the
studio and yeah just go solo objected no
until - like an hour ago when I texted
Emma no you know I think I'm gonna go I
think I'm gonna go solo tonight and Here
I am playing blood-borne there's a thing
there's a thing I'm gonna kill a thing
die you thing alright these dungeons are
starting to get harder so I might have
to shut up and pay attention to what I'm
doing
oh and I'm gonna apologize ahead of time
because I'm just streaming to the ps4 so
I'm not gonna be able to see read or
nobody's even going to be able to hear
steam tips or or what the fuck's tonight
I apologize that's what it is then that
earnest stream damn it this is the I
think these these second hint knowing
yeah the second hint or two one the
second level under the first or after
not under I guess it wouldn't be under I
don't know
I don't know what you're doing with that
but I've never seen that before and I
don't like it
I haven't played around with the
dungeons too much and that uh that bell
ringer was new damn you you fuck all
right
that took off a lot of health
oh you're a tough one yeah these
dungeons are definitely getting harder
oh nice whiff I can see the chat because
the way the PlayStation does this is
it's on the screen and obviously as you
can tell my there you are fuck you
set it under here
that's it under I got jack shit for all
room
that's where I came in things were I
came in maybe it's not yes it is yes it
is
um don't call the movies off I'm
probably not gonna be streaming super
late I don't want to drag my ass on the
PlayStation home at 1:00 a.m. so I'm
starting early but I'm probably gonna
end earlier too so keep keeping the
movie plan if you want to launch movies
I mean once again because I know people
are trickling in and trickling in you're
not gonna be able to hear subscriber
notifications or donations today I'm
sorry because I'm streaming just through
the PlayStation what I got I am because
I have never failed to retrieve blood
echoes on this run I'm kind of reluctant
to start the DLC because I know it's
gonna be balls hard
or you let your screamer fucking screams
miss that pok√©block shop fucker die
those guys are creepiest fucker probably
it might be my favorite enemy in this
game this dungeon is getting suitably
tough for my level that I might I might
not finish this particular dungeon I
don't know that's the thing that's gonna
happen
right
you just got a ps4 for the Black Friday
you need to get blood-borne yes you need
to get blood-borne this is a game of the
year material from me whatever whatever
in game of the year means why don't we
have to segment these things by here
it's a damn fun game
time for big swipes
no I haven't even tackled the DLC yet
because I don't want to die it's scary
I'm probably my plan was to do that
after this dungeon but the way this
dungeon is kicking my ass I don't know
I've beaten all of the the bosses
through the one reborn without losing my
blood echoes obviously I've died a
number of times but I've never failed to
retrieve and that that feels like an
accomplishment I don't want to throw
that away
I knew that was gonna have by the way I
just wanted to get this fight worried
about that anyone
now little bit too early there oh god I
should just leave this dungeon now
shouldn't I I should just leave it now
game of the year is so meaningless I
mean there's it's not like there's an
official body who can designate V Game
of the Year yep you have nine thousand
different people picking a game of the
year and then the title is just
meaningless absolutely fucking
meaningless
now our usual walk ahead to the jump
oh yeah my way
this is creepy and like the best
possible way would it be better if there
are centralized committee that doesn't
even mean any committee it's just it's
the dumb award was I anywhere near the
shootout in Milwaukee today I don't even
know that was a shootout in Milwaukee
today so I guess the obvious answer is
no I wasn't where was there shooting in
Milwaukee now that I'm gonna see it
because I'm too busy trying not to die
here
you know what I can't read the chai
can't I just can't read the chat this
dungeon just got a lot fucking tougher
than the previous one as first time I
ever fell off a ladder before what take
advantage of that that was a fun glitch
under level for this do I really want to
play through the DLC this is scaring me
this is scaring me
and I came in there all right
oh fuck off hit me through a wall
oh one blood vial that's helpful that's
right I think I'm gonna I'm gonna quit
this dungeon early I'm not dying for
this dungeon to get basically no good
reason there's no advancement to be had
here no I don't know that it's gonna be
word that I don't know I don't know I'm
just scared come on come on you bitch
all right
oh yeah I know I know you don't you
render you're not talking about I know
you don't shoot for damage if you
thought I was shooting for damage there
nope
I just fucked up a lot of reposts
parodies but ever whatever the fuck you
want to call them I just couldn't get it
I don't even want to see the boss I
don't even want to see it I'm just done
I just turn around immediately and not
look back and come at this judge dungeon
when I've gained like 30 more levels
that's what I should do if I were an
idiot
so they set a retreat strategy in the
preparation here I think I was in there
that's where I came from the answer I
get though great more doors
oh fuck he died from falling damage game
takes place in Australia I get it I like
that joke
slow and steady wins the race
slow and steady keep an eye out slow it
steady destroy those as much spit arrows
at me later all right and now I'm
reasonably confident that nothing is
going to jump out and eat me in this
room and yes turtle turtle style beat
Ernest style because down to seven hope
files because it's dungeon kicking my
ass kicking my ass
that's funny
where the hell did she go
son of a bitch son of a bitch
I was absolutely slaughtering the
dungeons until this one
where the hell did she go all right back
to this up here area all right
so I came in
that's everything this wing I don't
think I've missed anything when when
will I finish shadow of Colossus in four
years three months and 17 days precisely
yep I'm doing an earlier stream the name
sorry to throw everything off rich just
throw of everything
I could have just said never but that
wouldn't be sarcastic

[B] I get lucky I got like
no no no
Oh easy easy that really no really
hey rich do you watch watchmojo.com oh
oh you you know how I feel about
watchmojo.com and yes I did by
Helldivers and yes I loved it I've been
playing this I'm in the middle of a of a
blood-borne campaign here so I haven't
really played it too much then I have
bought it though then I have the same
night we streamed it and like played it
all fucking night
my opinion on Samurai Jack is I've never
seen it I'm glad they're making into
season for the fans that's that's a nice
thing that's happening but I don't have
I have no strong opinion one way or the
other that they're making it or on the
series I see you
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
it's a blood-borne and never failed to
recover lost blood echoes rum is what
this is I'm really decently far into it
I don't know why I'm risking everything
to fuck around with this retarded
chalice dungeon
that's behind me oh god the fear the
fear is palpable
I mean one of a the hinter tombs I think
the the second second harder hinder tomb
I forget what it's fucking called
oh shit I was looking at the chat
just like this over here is that
everything in this car
every blood vials are good
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
I'm taking a real easier I prefer not to
die
not using gas cones set but I am using
his head because I like the way it looks
I'll see using the coat because I like
the way this coat looks with the hand
but it's not gar scones coat just the
normal hunters code and I beat murder
ligarius with this setup so I think it's
too bad
all right
blood vials are filling up I got 12 now
antidote I don't like that I don't like
that at all Mourad oh god you gonna make
me fight the blood starve Beast you can
do that to me you know I'm watching I'm
watching me
well not watching me I'm just I'm
realizing Here I am I'm taking my way
through this dungeon like super fucking
cautious and jumping and everything then
I saw a youtube video yesterday somebody
doing a no death run on blood-borne in
three-and-a-half hours that's kind of
funny how unpro IM at this game
they didn't stagger that did not stagger
him running away running away
ruining my stagger stagger failed
running away
I've been playing for 45 minutes and I
have barely progressed it all medieval
well based on your outfits and the guns
and White House totally like seventeen
hundreds or so yes the stream is early
today but just just FYI it's not going
to go super late also I want everybody
to know that I'm not gonna be able to
hear any what the fucks or donations
today because I'm just streaming the ps4
so I'm not gonna be able to read those
comments I apologize
I don't god super cheese if I were a
superhero my name would be super cheese
hey it's working I'm gonna do it
I'm totally gonna beat him this wife and
this fine super cheese to the rescue
fucked it up oh I got a bloodstone
I got a bloodstone for all that work yay
just one little shard not even if I
meant even the twin blood sure just just
the new Buchert
why didn't get the nice I got the the
the not the bloodstone I got I just got
the blood check yeah anything too fancy
I'd love some more chunks yeah I got the
one stone shard did I get a chunk if I
got a chunk that was good I don't think
it was a chunk
is that all there is there's gotta be
more is gonna be so I'll wait I think
there's another upper level that I
didn't go in
all right well it's gonna kill me in
this room blood-borne so that means
there has to be something in every room
that can kill me right all right three
exits oh god damn it I got to stop
looking at the chance but I gotta do the
plan is I play this till I get bored
mister shy smile thank you for posting
that notice that alert and the the
status of the what the fucks well I got
an infected organ that doesn't sound so
good at all oh I've been infected Oregon
oh god damn it
oh let's break him in from
a Big Apple everybody needs to talk to
me what do you need to talk to me about
ah one of you oh you got flames
he's got flames we need to think about
this cuz he's got flames
it's got that one
ristretto chasing
strategy sorry but I need my I need my
gas cone hat yeah they're things I'm
flexible on no I haven't kind of too
much fire so let's get that physical
defense back on
actually I have some official
confirmation on how to say gasps :
I leaned the crow one of the characters
in this nay in this game says his name
aloud she says it gasps :
Gus Khun s : abs in like a scone is what
she says that's in game so that's what
I'm going with his father gets going
father gasps cone oh I'm out of power
I'm fallin pebbles goddamnit what am I
going to do I'm fooling pebbles
this is a cool room I don't know what
its purpose is
but this is a cool room with pebbles can
I do anything in here I'll get some room
to nowhere I'm okay with that
wait you know what a character in the
game vocally out loud out loud calls him
father Gaskin by the Gaston
all right what will kill me this time
all right how do I deal with will you
read too
explore texts stressing of course
fucking get out of there
it's cool pytho leave adversely big
oh shit
was it cool fight now it just sucks
I
yeah
I gotta get those echoes back first time
I've died tonight not bad not bad
I think we can do it

[C] away from that you get away from my
echoes
you'd be dead at war for your fucking
friend
how did that not post
how to bed night repose fuckin
come on you ain't got nothing you ain't
got nothing
no no I got damn it
Oh Richie Telegraph said junket jump
attack a mile away hey I'm nervous here
alright I've never failed to retrieve my
blood echoes no one I'm have had a great
run I don't want to fuck it up
so so bite me god damn it bite me you
ain't got nothing dies hey he got a
friend he had a friend with a sword
hammer
I still like this fight alright son I
like I like boss fights that are gold
fashioned duels and he's got he's got
the same type of sword as me and
everything it's great
if friends really leak
yeah yay all right
what's my favorite well I wish it was
easier to level up weapons cuz you kind
of have to to stick with with one
because the other ones are gonna be
overpowered
I mean underpowered because you don't
have the right materials to upgrade them
so it's hard to really compare and
contrast I've been using blades of mercy
which haven't been too effective in this
dungeon so I've got to stop using them
and I'm sticking with my my Ludvig right
now
blue Biggs holy blade because I like
forth early game
I love the axe and sometimes for certain
bosses I'll bust out the act axe
dark beast Powell whatever he's axe is
pretty damn effective on him it's got
that wide swing that fucks up his legs
this is weird that's wrong way
I wanted to play around with an arcane
build but it's so long before that's
useful I did once where I level of
nothing but Arcana by the time I finally
got a fire gem I was still less
effective than my strength and skill
kind of build so I've come back to this
which is this is all strengthen skill
slightly more strength I think I got
hold on let me get into a spot where I'm
less likely to be stabbed over here here
my stats fatality 29 endurance 25
strength 30 skill 28 I love it up arcane
enough so I could use some of the the
items and I've completely ignored
blood-tinged because the only thing I
ever use guns for is reposting
bloodborne all night not sure one
there's no gonna be an all night tonight
I see you I know you've got friends I
know how this game works
yep hi friend
really they're not gonna see me all
right Kevin's master of stealth
here's here's a question if I find three
more blood chunks would I be better off
upgrading my Ludvig cuz I need a to
upgrade that or should I use the five
lung chug blood chunks I have now to
upgrade the blades mercy what do you
think somebody came in I strike him in
the stats don't have strength is thirty
skills twenty-eight all right so I will
hold off next time I'm in the hundred
string and I will hold off then I'm
gonna upgrade the Ludwig later on once I
find three more blood chunks this is
just a dead end
all right it's just dead end wait he had
to be he wasn't guarding anything that
crazy man
they're usually guarding something is
there like a hidden chest blade
immerseus for builds with high school
yeah skills pretty high it's 28 it's
only 2 less than strength
all right I guess there is no chest in
here this is just a room just a room
all right door and door start with door
number one
well this whole wing just seems useless
which means a shitload of things
probably just gonna spawn magically into
these two empty rooms garden-variety
hobo man what's my game of beer where in
time is Carmen Sandiego that's the only
game I could think of that deals with
years that's my favorite game about
yours kind of an odd question really
Ludwig is an enemy in the deal see
before the DLC is just kind of a lure
character the first I'd say this was his
sword
yes rich rich brings the jokes
someone has to you know I can't see
what's going on down there but it's
dying and I'm just gonna let it die I'm
just gonna watch that help bar go down
let's stop going down huh interesting
helped my liking blood-borne well we did
a review on it earlier and we basically
sucked this game off this game is great
I'm just gonna stand here they want to
die on their own that's fine by me
yes I know about I know about the poison
so I'm not standing in it now what what
is shooting that Alvers the cannon I can
deal with that
why aren't I suspending them because I'm
leveled up high enough where that's
actually not gonna get me much that
might get me two levels right now I'm at
like level 80
how logistic sorry looking at the chat
doesn't not my friend I tried to pick up
a candle while I was half paying
attention to the chat the reason I'm
hanging back and not doing much is
because I can see their health bars
dropping so something is just killing
enemies for me and if I can just stand
back and wait for them to die that's
fine by me level 80 is more than enough
for lower gente to him get hinter to him
get good I'm winning I'm fucking
winnings but go to hell what do you want
out of me
you people are all mean
a lot of dudes
no there are no stream related movie
plans tonight I know there's gonna be a
normal movie Dix
related things going on later but
nothing I'll be streaming this is just
that normal rich Evan solo stream which
means boring this boring
getting a burger
oh you got a big big surprise nearly
caught me off guard with that one
all right I think everyone is dead
yeah so poison cloud purple means
poisoner Zulu so I had to knock over the
pot I was making up that was making the
purple cloud so I can get in so I can
get in there over my chest that son of a
bitch
yeah I got to all that shit again trick
is getting back there without losing all
of my blood echoes that's the trick
well getting back there without dying so
I can the treatment when it goes to be
more accurate is like I don't talk good
everyone knows that about me though me
no talk good this oh shit where do I
have to go I don't remember where it was
well son of a bitch I don't think it was
in here
what isn't here oh great
Oh fuckin great
wait a minute
where is that room I died in now I'm
lost this is this is fantastic
fan-fucking-tastic have I tried talking
to these creatures they're actually
there was one hold on I don't know where
I need to go no where am I
am I in the wrong area what happened
serve a bish
I have to get those blood echoes back I
have to
oh this is familiar with the poison this
is familiar
it's not it's not the amounts it's the
fact that this entire bloodborne run
I've never failed to retrieve my blood
echoes since I started this character
every single one of my blood echoes has
been accounted for and spent by me and
not lost to enemies
fuck fuck
I mean holy fuck fuck you game great
that is great I love it
sir

[D] 

[E] well it's not just I mean yeah that's
the tiny Christmas tree
the theme is a very Canon Christmas
I know also what splendors yeah I don't
know
thank you know they're leaving
okay oh oh this thank you for a big that
no but hello I guess I don't know I got
this magical little box to put all the
remote controls in oh my god
what is that remote I brought I brought
a new blu-ray player
oh that's my old one from home because
before we just said the shitty little
DVD player yeah so I brought that like
I've never seen that before yeah I have
to put batteries in it though
J says hello but not not really not
really he didn't okay was I doing
oh yes cashing in those blood echoes
good hunter
what is it you desire very well let the
echoes become your strength let me stand
close now shut your eyes
there we go that's about all I can do so
I got I got I got four out of that I
have four which I guess is better than
nothing
well good hunter may you find your worth
in the waking world always be polite
adult always be polite to the dollar
because she's a sweetheart
really well just one Rises one who's
that man which one are you
regular hinter tune then it's gotta be
you
Damon I don't know which one is the
right one
which one's the right water
oh it's not I'll just walk out and come
back again did you write one
this is definitely not ready
Oh anything has heart in it you're
already finished okay is that right
never notice that
oh that does say lower I'm looking over
I'm looking over at the right where it
just says hinter tomb I thought it was
the regular one I see it I see where it
says lower now though alright we're back
on track
everything's fine we're back on track
yeah I never noticed that the final boss
area one had had was labeled heart
before I never paid much attention to it
when can you when can you buy space crab
we're hoping we're hoping by the middle
of this month it's it's all in the hands
of the the people who are actually
pressing copies of the the disk it's all
in Manufacturing's hands right now we
are relieved of duty until until we get
the copy shipped to us then we got a
package probably about a thousand copies
of space copy which is fine but we'll be
selling it then all right
let's explore this little magical earth
hmm who's got me he almost got me
fucking fucking monster
let him run you got a ladder you're just
gonna run well it's fine by me I don't
give a shit
you gonna use the ladder right I have to
go down there and get you
we need to equip ourselves right ready
this show yeah that's that's a fuckin
poison
what was a dream Oh little ones o
fleeting we love the ancients let the
hunter be safe let him find comfort
never this before and let this dream his
captor foretell a pleasant awakening be
one day a fond distant memory meet
yes I was equipped for arcane defense
because I last the last thing I did
before the stream was I I went to
cainhurst castle had the boss fight
against made her martyr ligarius who who
loves shooting out magical bolts at your
ass so I was I was equipped to handle
that shit
a tea isn't loafer ligarius doesn't mean
that doesn't mean I shouldn't be ready
to defend against him is that hard boss
in general I know you I know you're
super elite and you don't need to worry
about equipment for that fight but I'm
not sorry sorry
yeah
it's not a required area though when I
play a game I like to do all of the
things there's a fun boss battle and a
neat area to explore why would I not do
it
am I going to finish the challenge
dungeons there's so many of them and
they're so hard probably not don't even
know why I'm doing these I wanted to do
a few of them because I felt like it
change of pace after this I was hoping
to finish this dungeon a lot sooner my
plan was after this challenge challenge
dungeon to jump into the the DLC
I said I'll do them eventually God why
are some people in the chat such fucking
assholes did they get off on it
why
some people just live to tear other men
down
Oh Tim tiny bitch is a little bit too
early not a deal with that problem
first up aggravating keep coming aren't
there it let's just get out of here
ooh what's killing him Oh is he he's not
immune to the poison this is useful
information
right now I'm letting the poison that
poison is not reducing on this patch of
hill yes
getting it further away from the poison
it would take so long to fucking kite
him
look you can call that cheese like the
poison kill that giant enemy actually
seems like a need strategy i'm gonna i'm
calling the strategy it's not like he's
caught on a door he's a monster that i'm
forcing to walk through poison that's
different
don't have any poison resistant yeah I
just went and I loaded up on poison
resistant rooms and I got this outfit on
which is poison resistant I never
fucking use them anyway
a lot of fuckin health
shit now
fuck pain in my ass it's a chemically
slow projectile but as you can see
getting hit by it will wreck your ship
wait time
all right well at least the souls are
sitting the echoes sorry wrong game the
echoes are just sitting right out there
and they open don't worry about killing
anybody I could just run and grab them
which is nice
alright alright
Jack will not be here tonight this is
just a rich solo night
bye see you later dip
ow
whoa doesn't work out what stone shard
damnit
all right hopefully the echoes didn't
get sucked into one of them that would
be bad that would be bad
oh you've a
yes I did get greedy I want to kill I
wouldn't say it's over I want to explore
and I don't feel like I could explore
with that fucker shooting cannonballs at
me so he's got to die the only thing to
worry about it the cannon blast yeah the
only thing to worry about are the cannon
blasts yeah yeah I'd agree with you on
that I think where we disagree on is the
level of worry
as ice glowing or think the glowing
parking
oh shit you're not dead yet you're not
dead yet
whoops
thought that was a throwing item oh well
but run 11 11 11 11 11

[F] 

[G] 

[H] after after I die double set a password
alright
Wow having the co-op partners really
eating into the frame rate
can my cool a partner hear me on the mic
when I'm streaming I don't know how
blood bond blueblood love works with
that this is boss does this do something
alright I'll follow you I don't know
where I don't know what the hell I'm
doing with this deal see this is all
news to me yes I am streaming directly
from the ps4
all right
I don't know where to go next come on
partner assuming something you can't
hear me I don't really know I have no
idea what I'm doing essentially chef you
know we're ready to go
back up the stairs into the right right
alright did I lose my co-op partner
possibly I don't know all right
mmm
you know something a little bit harder
than that um what about harder just less
likely for some random person to add
whatever doesn't matter
prereq all right password prereq
is that all everyone needs I'm assuming
one
I mean up using the dome for summary use
item why isn't it using the item aisle
because I have its is it continually
working at home I don't know
I'm going to assume it's still in use
the Bell like I don't multiplayer I
don't know how these things work it's
already active okay that's what I needed
to know
Wow
why exactly the mayor of fraud now what
thing that I do that you don't like
password is free reckon we have no
takers nobody wants to join me for co-op
not one single person
that's fine doer doats all the same
spray came from his work
yes prereq oh that's nice that's nice
all right suppose I'm obligated to try
some of the fancy new weapons
now what the sucks probably doesn't
sound level at all which is a negative
on blood-borne leveling weapons is too
important too hard I want to switch it
up every now and then but I can't
because this or that it has no levels on
it it's not upgraded enough to be useful
boom hammer is cool but slow and also
did no damage with a direct hit the
heavy attack so it gonna fuck itself
all right Cole 128 has arrived all right
hope the heads of it
hello Cole alright alright now I'm gonna
I'm just gonna follow you around because
