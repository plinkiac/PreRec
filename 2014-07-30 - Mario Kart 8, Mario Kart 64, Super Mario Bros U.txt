film so the free right I'm trying to
play the game technical happen technical
issues today was supposed to be the day
that we were going to record all of the
gameplay footage for our Nets prereq
episode of Mario Kart 8 and I had a hard
drive failure and we lost a couple hours
worth of really good footage all of the
footage that like the first time playing
it Rich's first time playing J was here
playing the games we created knees we
created knees for rich and J and it was
a really fun time and the hard drive
crashed and we lost some footage and we
felt really sad and so we said fuck it
we're gonna stream so now we're
streaming I'm going to open up what
looks like it
while rich plays
it takes Talent it's not it's not for
talent you say you're winning

finishing up some work but right now
it's me enriched Saint : we're done
cleaning up yeah but anyway the lobster
footage in number
I'm too depressed to go on really I said
fuck it so hope you guys don't mind
after I tweeted this afternoon that this
room there is not gonna be no stream
today we're gonna stream on Friday we
figured there might be something
oh yeah we're here do you wanna keep you
all right I'll use this we're gonna play
some verses now
yeah I think we're ready to go up to
100cc now Ritchie's game man you are 100
for sure he's might even unfasten what
because I won you may be a Mario Kart
expert that doesn't mean I'm horrible
I am very expert that Jack is currently
obsessed with this game I've played a
lot of mario kart thank you you didn't
win every year yes junkie though there
will still be a stream on Friday oh yeah
yeah we're not cancelling that this is
just this is I felt like it yeah we felt
like it this is a bonus stream there
will still be a stream on Friday Friday
is gonna be the Nintendo 64 stream josh
is gonna calm ride a super exciting
there
all right I'm gonna be I wouldn't be my
me go we got a new part yep oh the
sports cool the front yes this is
depression stream yeah that's an
accurate assessment situation silver
tone Sonic the Hedgehog is not a good
game we have a whole video describing
why it's not if it were just us shitting
on it and laughing yeah I'd be one thing
but we've brought up points and we
talked about why we felt the way we do
mm-hmm
so I think our criticisms are valid you
know there's still opinions sure I think
I'm gonna be the sports coupe it seems
super nice top speed here
at the standard you wanted my bonus I
got I got values here of my values yes
well you know I'm a bald man with
glasses everything looks like Moby let's
go for one that doesn't have the three
stars because then everyone see you see
down bottom by some of them have the
three right now I'm trying to go one all
right 100% Mario Kart
oh I'm sorry if you were trying to watch
sharknado 2
why would you go watch sharknado 2 I
don't know catch up with a stream later
yeah this will hey I know how long we're
gonna go tonight this might not be
what's this we're starting late summer I
believe I might go so I get I have to
drink beer and then sober oh we need to
pause it right away and change motion
fun I don't like it okay
all right here we go off to the races
you're the one that's you yeah yeah out
here with this Jam we okay so jack is on
the right
riches on the Left riches Murray riches
Mario Jack is the blue helmet oh my god
this is significantly harder with the
wing
all power slides Jack is a power slide
expert I can Tokyo Drift this is all I'm
saying oh my god did you give your enemy
rapport no that's coming out talk you're
drifting to the s Tokyo Drift right into
your s hi here we go oh you're Mario
yeah Mary hey guess what boom power
slide
you can't can't dig on this
rich is still figuring out how to power
slide and I've discovered I was trying
to like we played with with rich in with
jr. and I realized like explaining it to
someone or trying to verbally explain
how to power slide it's a really
difficult test so I'm hoping that he can
just kind of watching
until then I'm just gonna win I'm gonna
beat it you really likes being a jerk I
do I'm sorry okay Jam
welcome to the jam yeah this is the slam
hey okay okay
banana watch out for bananas by the way
that's all mario kart is is watch out
for bananas I do almost wish there was
an auto gas button never I die I cannot
think of a time once in the game that
I've taken my thumb off of the gas pedal
just like why not just make that boom oh
thank me first place someone is asking
whether or not I enjoy the gamepad don't
you and I do it's a little I mean it's
different is is the real thing and it's
surprisingly comfortable to hold in your
life didn't ya like it's it's you know
and what like you find yourself when you
game you kind of just like rest it on
your legs and it's it's really nice in
your than on your lap I can't imagine
like
like a sugar bank comfortable with a bun
way out I don't know yeah I'm using the
stick and the butter seems it might be
switching between the two shoulder
buttons is awkward they want you to use
your index and your middle finger which
is just a terrible idea
yeah the two shoulder buttons are really
far apart yeah but I've never been in a
situation in which I need to use them
both rapid succession
so I remember once it's too so here's a
Mario Kart pro tip when you see the
letter to when they're counting down to
three two one that's when you press on
the gas pedal that's what gives you the
speed on the last come on the tube now
you start moving up on the tooth
also I am thinking about going pro I
don't know if you guys just saw that
promo vessel again just talk wrench you
can hold bananas behind you
when someone shoots a red shell at you
to block cut you and green chose to not
just block to cut nothing whoever's
behind me God
all right hey you have those let's let's
you know sometimes you get caught
sometimes you get caught you know bring
your bad luck some place aren't that
yeah
whoever's behind me is getting all the
red shells
check this out jump in the Yale company
every jumps is super cute
here's what you should know about Jack
he's super granamyr I'm in first place
Oh did you just throw glue shot at me it
doesn't matter I'm so far in front it
doesn't even super jerk disguised as
many plays Mario Kart Oh actually and by
the way there was someone right next to
me hit them too I'm great
I am a jerk I'm really sorry but also
I promise
my future right back I also just kind of
think it's fun
I'm being extra a jerk because so yes
I'm blaming this tree
yes MLG Pro Mario Kart are we gonna do
we just get a sub tell me so this this
shit
yes hero of Leon hero of Lenin no hero
of lemon thank you for subscribing we
appreciate that have a pizza roll jack
is really very tiny touch
we weren't we're not necessarily set up
or streaming yeah and so I don't have my
nice microphone I don't have my extra
monitor and so I probably sound like I'm
sitting your furthest away yeah so if
anything sounds or it looks funny
tonight okay that is the moral of the
story this is really tough the Wiimote I
might I might move to the back control
so when you see that - that's right
and then for every jump is another
mariokart pro tip every single jump you
hit that jump button dump button which
is the power slide button which is what
I'm doing right now every single jump
you hit that button and it gives you a
little boost on our side power slide no
this is pink taking pink
to Jim Jim Jim
I went too fast don't go fast
ah
but be ok with it
and God probably oh that was it so one
of the new items they added to mark our
date was that item I just had which is a
red box with a little yellow it's like a
big noise maker and it is the first ever
defense against the blue shell and what
I mean by that is like you know if you
had a star or something you could defend
yourself against the blue shell but
never gonna starve you that is an item
that you get first place and it defends
against
Oh powers like
next week a new mark
who that who that noise
who saves hours life
go get that power slide down stick with
pink offer who's that yeah
it's game is all about power signing
Tokyo driftin if you know what I mean
up in here r.i.p Walker everyone stop
listening today strange man this is her
jerk this is very true sometimes Dec
just talks no particulars
turn are you
yeah okay I just plugged in I have the
whatever this is the classic controller
this'll do me oh I don't
sure yeah Jack is extra silly tonight
that is very true
that was horribly depressed
it depresses me when computers don't
work it really does because they're
supposed to we only lost the game plays
oh that's right we still have us all of
our talking
okay we're gonna how to play the game
again new control
oh yeah
yeah it's their power slang
that fire sign into the coins into the
boost into the boost and a jump off the
boost everybody's everybody's impressed
you know who's most impressed it's jack
nobody's born personally that means
stupid power drift you still not getting
the partner really guys suck at racing
games weren't only my bag
yeah yeah okay sir it's not for everyone
it is not forever
Oh fun will appear for these Oh in case
you guys haven't figured it out only
because
I have always and forever been a huge
fan of lots of memories
- would you move would you hit that jump
on it if that jump up when you go after
jumps get a little boost
now it's 9-9 a power slide power slide
check us out at mobile it's blue city
just boost off of everything yeah
boom City baby you keep it put city
population a jack he's talking about how
much I started I'm sure that I have not
checked
well in the victory loading the victory
we got nothing
hmm
fire cart isn't it you know what maybe
it is maybe it's an acquired thing it's
like what is somebody saying oh that's
what someone said Mario garden an
acquired taste
it's like you know this is the kind of
games I would play we'd get together by
mark
what it used to be is right um eight out
of high school
guys
bring such and that this wasn't usually
our test someone who would want to go
home and who would think they were too
drunk to go we played Mario Kart and
depending on how well they drove and
where our cars out we'd let them go well
if anything it stopped them from going
home for like an hour if they were to
whoa three stars
everything's great how are you guys
tonight okay different course choose
different cars we made a rich me too I
mean genic has had one beer tonight and
I'm having another one now really is not
that great stopped you
ears weird that way I'm gonna dig in
this don't worry about it but no my
confidence is not coming from the beer
it's coming from joy of playing Marc
especially with this yeah well you know
this like everything's just
so this gives me a little more
this big honking thing I've got that is
really great it's just the the pad rests
I only been great with the pad is I find
specifically for Mario Kart the on
screen stuff useless it's gonna be about
five games totals of the system that
seriously need this group right
that being said but I would like to try
it clang just on the screen that's what
I'm selling points at the weeds that you
can play the game just the screen
breathe so it's like Oh suck it biggie
Luigi I wonder what it would be like to
play a game like Mario Kart
I have a question which is by the way
another
butt-fuck powerslide yo which is that
fuck that another one of my big gripes
of the system is when you're playing
multiplayer and you want to look at just
the screen it it shows the entire it
shows everybody shows the split-screen
it's like a little shit show me just hey
Veon but what car do you have got this
big thing yeah
slidin might be a wheel selection
those the wheels make a big difference
if you want Jax kind of rocking it
yeah it might sound like it's cutting
out every once in a while we're just
using the UM laptop microphone using
garbage just garbage is what we got we
got we got nothing but garbage this I've
yet to play Meijer garden newer than
double - double - I love double - double
- was really fun
that was the I mean for the you know 30
people who owned a Gamecube Double Dash
was great I don't know what either of
them are the truth the tiny wheels of
the bed I don't know I don't I don't
know well let's find out if anything we
can just do it right
oh yeah did you guys see I can't read it
because it's very tiny but Kotaku linked
to the sonic review and I thought that
was really about some of them so how
many how many people on the thread hey
toes yeah
how many people loves on a guy's job
yeah you obviously I didn't say I hate
son I never said that argument was
overrated
and in fact that you went out of your
way to say that you still enjoys I
started to I didn't get much food no no
it's like when the to is all the way out
like it's not a situation no and I also
made sure to keep that in the editing
you know that we said like you liked it
especially while rocking a Chaos
Emeralds because I knew that was
important
but still you know people just see it
assume both of us hated it even though
it was just me that they could I agree
but I mean yeah as far as like overrated
goes it's just one of those things where
the games are overrated
but Sonic as the embodiment of the Sega
Genesis is very important and I totally
get and agree with that point Genesis
was big competition for Nintendo as a
good system had a lot of fun games Sonic
was the mascot so Sonic does deserve a
place in history now because of those
games I think that's the takeaway
as far as I - if you like the games
though I think that's what us it's the
wheels you want super touch the next the
next horses yeah I'm just gonna pick
both basic standard birthers okay
nothing that's fine I just
I always just choose like stock moves
cuz I have no anyone your 12th place oh
my god oh I just went to 11
oh there you go love it be ready ready
you're doing it
get there get there buddy that I mean
also I ever do apologize like we're both
playing right now so we can really read
the stream of the comments
we're playing but in between matches
I'll make sure to check it
it's not really anyone's free to monitor
the chat right now I don't have magic
guys I can't do this that you know what
actually I just see someone mentioned
Crash Bandicoot I the one really
surprising thing is I've heard a lot of
people defending Crash Bandicoot games
never I can't
that's to me more surprising than Sonic
yeah I understand people liking Naughty
Dog
I understand that sure sure that's
pretty the things they like you like
Jackson Dexter they like oh sure they
like drake's Fortune a glassed of us and
so it's just it's like sorry I can't
have no control I think a car with low
acceleration that I can't control
constantly hitting things and I can't
get up oh yeah and did you know the
golden boy I'm gonna do that okay he's
throwing it there because of your tiny
tiny wheels yeah yeah look at you dating
now this whole game is wrecked because I
forgot to do the initial
what
get that coin so if you guys see us
collecting these coins think or anyone
who doesn't know for anyone who does not
know you can collect up to 10 coins in
Mario Kart 8 and helps your Maximus and
then a little bit of a speed boost oh my
god
apparently I can't drive home ice world
so but the coins are some of the coins
are a little out of the way so
collecting the coins is really important
out of that first lap and try to hold on
to as many as you can
round the rest
and always powers like you guys were
ever thinking about not power-sliding I
would power slam
in a room fun game but we're playing
fucking marketer
beddin deal with it
rich knows how to place we're doing is
once but you start the slide you can
move right or left but you don't turn
yes it's right here
that's how the slide works so it's it's
whether or not you're turning a hard
right or a soft right and once you start
this line and so this is you got a turn
to start the slide but you have to turn
to start to find the slide just guides
you it's it's nothing but intuitive have
you ever driven
have you ever Tokyo drifting no well
okay I Drive with the same even big but
so the first thing you have to do I go
to the store when I come home yeah first
thing you have to do is Tokyo driving it
like when when I was learning how to
drive a car that was one of the very
first things that I was point ochio
drift not so good is is go out in the
snow in an empty parking lot and slide
did you ever do that oh that's what they
say to do is to go out into an empty
parking lot and slide around so you will
know what it's like to slide so then
when if you're in an emergency situation
so maybe this is the problem you've
never Tokyo perfect I'm just gonna keep
going and don't go drifting John kilo
knowin in Mario Kart 8 you do not move
slower on earth there are a ton of water
section yeah there's a ton of underwater
sections and it's really fun
get a little propeller
makes no sense it's perfect sense for
fun we tried holding our breaths
underwater sequences right ah we lost
all of it
No we might have lost all that I'm gonna
try to recover all that's a rawhide
needy gorilla step one
Tokyo Drift step two question mark step
three profit you did it a little too
soon too soon
yeah it's like it's like when you have
to let go no no like you know like the
two kind of like chops up wait until the
two is all the way out okay okay
it's been Marta curtain villa
I got this game not this good this came
on Monday
it's game Monday night I've been playing
this game pretty much since
showed up late to the studio today
playing this game this morning had to
get quick work done in the afternoon
which is my house a little friendly but
also like I've just played every single
Mario Kart that is
I am a Nintendo fanboy I don't think
there's anything wrong with being a
thing well it's like what's the
connotation of family stupid I think sir
I like I think been a fanboy means
surrendering the grain and the Viking
something just because it has the right
oh well I don't like to find sample oh
okay well then I'm not at that I am a
fan of Nintendo Nintendo makes quality
products a lot of the time you also have
the time next time standard things
standard ever standard go to hurt
stamping wheels you need to standard
Mario you need to go standard until you
learn you learn once he wants you to
figure out some stuff then you can send
lesson now learn the rules before you
can break him no I'm saying everybody
yeah
you jump
ah Tokyo Drift past the banana also they
have these sections here like we just
saw where it's like we ain't pass stuff
and I have no idea what the purpose of
that is what that's okay that I can read
the agree to China Sonic 2 is the best
game for Sonic absolutely absolutely
does anyone remember the 90s absolutely
I tied for 11th place Haney
congratulations you have your dear
you're tied for last
oh there's another race
yeah always practice Tokyo drifting
oh well I'm glad that this dream is
sexually arousing
by the - that's so weird well because it
takes your tires
time to rev up past games wasn't it
always thing I think it's I actually
don't remember I want to say it was
different customs yes I think you're
right that's like you have to hit it
like right before or the last signal
goes yeah yeah you might be right and it
might be different for each game I don't
know gentlemen we have a special guest
on cabs in skis here so now it's just me
what's so bhavam hi everybody
Hayes here David Mike send the laptops
away
okay because suppose I could sit in the
chair alone thank you
we're gonna scoot over very tired and
sore now you're talking hello addict can
people hear me yeah I see that
see go
yeah
since we don't have a proper audio setup
I'm not talking sensibly about when
Peaks blu-ray that just came out how
amazing the deleted material is I save
that for another day became an economics
Kudo at brains have shut off so I can
articulate things properly I'm very
tired because I was up all night
watching drink leaks blu-ray stuff yeah
- I've gotten two blue shells yeah this
is following different printing paths
I have gotten to Michelle's Oh No
Eastern tiny Oh
well above Olivia oh that's all I
remember in the n64 version there were a
couple of courses where if you made
people aren't tiny like before a jump
they got like sent back to the startup
yeah
and so you would always like watch your
friends screen and right before they hit
that jump you've hit the lightning bolt
fuck their shit
three times her head my those who won
terrible that's okay it's okay to be
terrible oh yeah a lot of people are
just like saying like I need stuff like
you remember 90's stuff I remember the
night I was oh my hey Dylan this is
someone just the news does anyone
remember Animaniacs he names was the
greatest how old are you that's asking
that guessing you're younger than us
probably maybe you're not old enough to
be nostalgic yet once you are old enough
to be nostalgic he'll understand it's
fun
yeah why are you that's what it was
Mario Stadium 64 had a jump to jumped
over an earlier part of the track which
was also okay like a meat level design
but then if you lightly need someone in
the middle of the jump they would drop
down to the beginning of the crap into
the track it was really funny okay hey
we do it um sure always think we would
you like a spot on the couch yeah yeah
you know what you know what it does okay
we're gonna three raise now all right
we're gonna have a three race hey Larry
um I'll be this guy uh you know the fact
that he's called a shy guy is probably
something I didn't know at one point in
my life is super acceleration
mr. scooty mr. studio super acceleration
what speed they only have like it
anything and super acceleration it had
yeah my acceleration accelerating the
jack-shit if you get like this game you
can get hit with everything and
everything so that's I'm used to just
getting hit with everything that's what
happens to me when I play this I'm
calling it well that's not it's probably
true that it's probably okay y'all so
rich is Mario in the top left Jack is
Luigi in the top eight J shy guy in the
bottom
what is going on oh it was on the wrong
thing
it was on this I think hope that's all
right see what happened yes yes now I
can okay sorry okay here we go you
fixing help
everything's under your personal
I hate everything I just eat everything
better let's do it let's do it cuz
there's so much good enough you should
pick up the new twin peaks' blu-ray you
won't hate it cuz it's great it's got 90
minutes of new material that I have
never seen before
oh my god I don't know where I'm going
there
ah how am I getting worse that's how I
feel when I play these games
it's official it's
ah I tried to tell the owner of deck
video I don't believe in the Tokyo
drifting never works for me you gotta
live in Tokyo Drift it's the only way by
the way I don't know if every just saw
my from me I Major League Gaming Pro
moon is if there's someone second place
kind of behind you
hit the brakes and the blue shell was a
total dick and it's awesome just so
he'll drifted right another wall can't
explain to you how to Tokyo Drift it's
gotta be learning it just learned I just
Tokyo Drift it into the wall again Wow
I don't think it works this is made-up
nonsense wing and you started to Tokyo
Drift you're locked into turning in one
direction yep and then you can either
turn harder
just tell us every single time that's
all I do
it doesn't work just trying to make a
fool out of me it's why it's my mind
game yes you know it's a rich here in
your Mario right yeah yeah better than
you I suck Susan escape bad reviews and
so Ken yeah well you know what rich you
should have raised
that doesn't change any of the problems
with the game you're still the game is
on the rails you can't see what you're
reacting to see what your old so the
thing you don't know is coming Mike
stripe for anyone good no I wants to
understand the joke that was everyone
everyone who criticized rich a nice
critique of Sonic everyone just a resume
which did nothing to diminish all of our
critiques rolling the Matabele sewers
under Mushroom Kingdom
if he doesn't work Tokyo drifting is a
myth hear me now
Tokyo Drift for life all I maybe he
blamed it on my car earlier when I
played but I'm blaming it on it's not
working I'm blaming I know exactly I
undo it exactly what you say to do and
all I do is run into walls I'm blaming
it on my inability to explain to you how
to properly okay okay I I apologize
oh my lord where am I see buddy job
local duty job
do
you didn't
yeah
ah about the stubble it's my favorite
best in the furies doesn't sink supposed
to be good
I don't know fine I think those movies
at this point I've never seen a single
one yeah but what I gather they know
exactly what they are and and they just
try to be as good as they can
yeah how does that goes I'm sure they're
fine what was the latest one six I think
what I heard was that one reached a
point of self-awareness where it was
like they were like meeting with oh no
that's what was that what that was Tork
where they had like a kung fu fight with
motorcycles right and I have no glue
it's a it's fast and furious with
motorcyclists and they have a come to
pass
okay they fight it's like I might swing
them around yes like they swing around
motorcycles one winding
really watch the torque is that a movie
it's a movie I'm in pre-production no
big deal bad boys boy you learn no no
this time I am in 12th place rich
because I'm balding off of everything
huh and hitting every single wall
I've tried I've tried Tokyo drifting and
that's a bunch of bullshit yes it is it
took you I'm driven right into that wall
this particular bike has a lot of really
sharp corner it does that's where Tokyo
drifting really helps cuz like look up
it's not wrong place
yeah how come I'm in first it's like if
this is because apparently you play this
game way too - I got this game on Monday
Harold this is the curb you have to
start Tokyo drifting like here and then
like drift there where do you start it
for the stream or there's no camera
alright if to start drifting way before
the turn
it didn't work but that's okay
okay well then it did work
I know no one's gonna want to be my
friend if I keep Tokyo drifting sorry
Street
this is my problem there forever
problems I run out of people to blame I
wonder why is your ass yeah
like yeah
oh my god everybody's hitting me
everybody has a register it's probably
everybody everybody's got red shell
we have to read Chelsea
there there are a few games that I'm not
allowed to play with my life I cannot
play Smash Brothers with her though she
will kick my ass in any any other 2d
yeah like Marvel vs. Capcom the game in
which she will destroy me and I don't
know why any a sword like Street Fighter
Mortal Kombat any of those types of game
I will get them direct
but for some reason Spanish brothers
like Mario Kart
Beach out of here
this actually is what really excites me
about to be be used as gamepad so I can
play on the gamepad while she watches
directors from Swiss comments on it okay
oh really
you said actress actor plays an actress
is the thing we were all telling each
other to shut off the any bill that
episode where mike tells me to shut up
and then Josh tells him to shut up
no it'll be up new vessels the worst of
leo
probably tomorrow something there aren't
any technical errors and plates so is
that the only one of those you can yeah
by somebody oh sorry
I think rainbow
oh it's just a boat over 30 this is the
bridge that leads to Thor's world asgard
asgard that's something this is right no
similar oh ok ask everyone as well as
there is the planet leave the ever frost
the Bifrost is the Bifrost is the
pathway between one
you know
and at least three other stable world
the frustrates that is - earth
I think the earth is cold the banks are
weirdos someone in the stream sure is
handsome god damn it
oh my god let his heart I just went from
third place to seven and half a second
because everybody hit me at the exact
same time this is the frustrating part
of this game mm-hmm yeah yeah you son of
a bitch
it just happened together I got back up
to fourth and all about it just like
that
yeah but also you get back up to
Sam
oh my fuck what was that
people saying where is it Noren frost
critic track

blown up that's like the norm frost or
so

speed you know what a motorcycle
high-speed are this car has been do I
really wow I'm mentally sick what what
works sy I'm gonna say Anke King King
what every um no Jack and rich have not
talked about the reception of Masonic
would you like us to talk about the
receivable sonic video I'm assuming they
would cuz everybody hates you guys now
it's pretty true no you know what
actually I've seen that's what I'm also
saying a lot of positive
people are apparently heavily divided on
the sonic this is important it's a 30
year old video game it's apparently an
issue on the on the red letter media
subreddit is a mobius strip that's
awesome
the the sonic episode has the most
amount of comments over anything
subreddit right now people really love
to talk about something whether or not
something is good people are passionate
about the shit they grew up with it's
crazy
yeah oh that's fine I think I think it's
all fine like and as we've said a
gazillion times on this live stream like
whatever you're into man if you want to
like sign a new like Sonic that's fine
I'm not gonna stop you and like in Sonic
but you said that you don't mess and
that means that that's your opinion you
think your opinion expect that's how
that's how people react yes things
exactly who are you to express your
thoughts on this
I'm just semester Jack back yeah I I
really enjoyed the sonic video there
were a few audio issues that I realized
that bored sorry if I brought in our
here's a couple loud but I really like
the sign
I think Regina I got to express our
thoughts very clearly and I appreciate
anyone who enjoys the jokes and who does
not because of an episode about video do
you on some level though appreciate the
people that want to move on somewhere on
some level I would like to it's just
just my shit here what I'm doing right
now your life yeah no it's gonna you're
crazy
down here you know what you are the
mayor of crazytown that's what I'm
saying
we're living in a village full of crazy
crazy
thank you saying we're driving up a wall
I like the fact that this courses of
fucking mobius strip yeah it's beautiful
this is beautiful design the people
talking about samurai cop yes we're
aware he's alive he tried to work
something out and it didn't come
together
unfortunately never never will is
instead yeah okay
unfortunate but whatever if I want to
know anything about what he's been up to
there's a podcast called he's
picturehouse I think is the name of it
rock did like a two hour long interview
with him that gets you up to date on
everything the second part that's
focused solely on samurai first part was
the to our first to our part it's just
his life burn after Santa oh it's a good
listen I highly recommend it
let's already oh yeah
and he does not reference us by name but
if you listen to podcast he explains
that he was talking to the clog a blog
about coming out and doing a cameo in
the film he doesn't mention us by name
which is nice but he's big he's talking
about us and white anything
he didn't know how to upload a video to
youtube so he can call our site a blog
you guys are vloggers right
blow dear blonds to the vlog or a log
for the called bolt right I've always
assumed water long ism oh I'm gonna be
mom yeah no I've never I've never heard
it said be longer for the first period
of time I've heard that
I'm not go the movie enemy yes I've seen
enemy enemy is one of my favorite movies
in the last few years it's fantastic now
there's someone that comments exit enemy
and under the skin or two movies I've
seen recently that no one's making
movies like that right so it's really
exciting especially enemy I like that
it's like two people in the start
now that is legs it's true this no I
mean yeah I know I hear you hear you
0:04 the blues oh yeah yeah
observe that I mean I would feel bad if
I wasn't still in for twice
but we have any other games we can that
we can download again we have the Wii U
here and there you can download games so
that we do you condemn you don't have to
insert the cartridge you're doing sit
suitor character at the blow of the
cartridge first and then put it into the
machine never go into the cartridge use
a q-tip button - so what having you over
the cartridge you don't own the digital
media that's a licensing given the
option I'll always take something up
this movie is a bit paranoid
also there are no spikes in this game
that I know there are some bottomless
things other skeletons that need to be
removed don't lose any skeletons so oh
sorry yes this is Jack versus rich rich
is Mario on the Left Jack is this is the
one that's losing lucky thing on the
right there's the one that fucking sucks
apparently a barrio cover for anyone
just joining the stream i see i saw
someone said they're just joining the
stream
jack is really good at Mario Kart and
rich is learning how to play again
I remember being good at the version I
remember playing races on wine and
winning
okay so it's just you might be out of
practice and that's fine that's fine
I had a couple online matches last night
and enjoy it it was it was really fun
playing with I think the most I had
online I was like there ten other people
it was really fun playing with ten real
challenged you know like no offense to
Nintendo's AI but it ain't the brightest
so yeah playing with that many real
people that's real and like a real
challenge people be bitches I only I
want to say it played like I have games
last night and i won i only won worn
like a min first the rest time it was
like pretty soundly like do you know
like I can do it smart
which is nice
and you can you can tell immediately
they knew what they were doing
which is fine I had like a little
ranking system you know if you come in
here
Mikey Bailey goes up
it seemed to work the only weird thing
but like the good and the bad about you
I know I'm ami that there's no voice
chat you can choose to stay a list of
predetermined phrases so you can say
let's get the game started I hope I do
better next time you know stuff like
that
and so you know everything was quiet and
I felt and you just see everyone else's
movies and so like everyone just seemed
really polite mostly because they
weren't talking and then all these nice
smiling weave means were there and
you're just like oh I kind of do want to
talk to you but then you did yeah they
just be saying awful awful things so
expect
I do also have high broad Albert is the
my regard for the week
sometimes do it sometime
the difference in the feel with handle
little edges yeah I break it off
every day
no Jack and rich rich is on the left
Tech is on the right
I'm just hanging out and JC's hanging
you know some work in the background
someone just the best of the worst it
should be up tomorrow
Oh God pass the word should be out to
Serbia tomorrow assuming there's no
last-minute technical issues
rich is using the gamepad I'm using the
Wii classic controller the Wii classic
controller that you plug in to emote
looks like a real control I tried using
the Wii mode earlier on but not much
care for it which is using the gamepad
overall we kind of like the gamepad has
a nice weight to it and it feels it's
nice when it's kind of resting under all
happening to have different games yeah
that's the thing is we so far we've only
use it with one character oh it's only
yes the awkward super cut is wonderful I
think we say three or four more times
and the new episodes coming out tomorrow
which someone made a supercut of every
time we use the word awkward on best of
the worst gig so me right yeah Betsy
this mentioned in the stream and yeah
because it's the best quality of that
movie to know yeah
red shell what I'm tiny make that light
Oh blue shells Oh dick evolution that
kind of sounds like there's no justice
she just overtook me and the blue shell
game no justice
oh did you throw the personnel it just
seems wrong you been in first place yeah
yeah no sometimes that's just the luck I
feel like I got hit by two red shells
right in a row watch tiny I asked for
someone named me yeah and so what it
overtook me in a movie okay such is life
sometimes you getting hit with red
shells
sometimes you're missing a bleep joke
sometimes you eat the blue shell
sometimes it needs you
I just want to play on my own
oh oh maybe is it just like a country
over you like
I don't know
yes there is still going to be a stream
on Friday yeah that's not it it's gonna
be a this is sort of an impromptu street
right special guest he came in late
basically we were trying to film for
previously the corner we're trying to
play this for previously deported and
there was a technical issue and we lost
two hours of footage and we just didn't
feel like we're doing it we're just sort
of sweet yep but you still will be
playing Friday but they know what the
somewhat special occasion is well Josh
can finally make it to a stream we've
finally worked that we finally figured
out a workaround for Josh's schedule so
josh is coming to the stream on Friday
nintendo64
oh it's gonna be crazy you guys like
polygons you like blurry screams yeah
it's gonna be it's gonna look but it's
gonna be a lot of fun a lot of four
player games someone generously donated
an n64 we have gold and I we have Smash
Brothers we have Mario Kart
ooh starfox yeah when I would play
Starfire will get a copy of star
the josh and i will talk about 20k yes
does Josh investing I watched all the
twin peak stuff last night yeah her I
think for most of the stream it's going
to be this it's this one peak stream I
want to play the Twin Peaks Super
Nintendo game that came out at the 1991
so listen I know I think actually most
history was just gonna be kind of rich
me and Josh and maybe Jessie and then
Mike and J will join us later
we have very important business to
attend to on Friday they're very very
important what happens um very important
business very important business happens
oh I think there's a movie coming dude
that has nothing to do no no I guess
maybe a little you see this
I have heard that the temporal I know in
Australia in Australia all right yeah
okay they release the post they posted
the poster on Twitter and it's um
jumping out of exploding building misses
with the September 11 yes
no you can't expect that to be a
cultural thing there well it's it's a
worldwide known event certainly it was
an oversight on somebody's part and they
didn't release it like um they really
said on their Twitter yeah like just
like their whoever's released me we
let's say it's paramount released it on
Paramount no it was something else for a
long time Oh what's a paramount in
Australia oh yeah it's a little it's
it's an oversight on their part and it
was kind of stupid but I don't think
it's worth being upset a song people we
got it down have people some people have
benefit it's insensitive but did not
intentionally did any Australians die I
mean sure they died on stencil you die
every day this is a good conversation
yeah okay we're gonna take it away I'm
gonna run a commercial and and we're
gonna come back and maybe play something
else or maybe not or maybe fuck you I
don't know this is the mood worried the
night folks left and you're gonna see
the spinning flower thing because I
don't have my little curly damn episode
every lately impromptu everything
everywhere everything's fine

[Part II]
see you guys we talk word erm we just
had a really interesting erm
conversation okay we've had it before on
the stream I'm sure right now Jay has
black eye really
oh sure is that we can be but what we've
decided to do is um maybe yeah that's
good makes nothing okay um I have a new
super mario brothers EU which I haven't
played yet I'm gonna play that cuz rich
cousin marker real claim left for 27
hours and I haven't played in years of
my rozier yet so this is the newest just
regular no super mario world 3ds yeah oh
my god I would call this a regular Mario
game no it's nothing newest oh is with
jazz
I think I think 2j know this this the 2d
side-scroller is a normal Mario game
just do me - no newest new a new list
there there are there are a few newer
ones than this this is a new worse
yes
guys what SpotPass someone tell me what
spawn passes a surface that may be a
Washington place
no the mic the mic is cutting up kind of
no I
we can't change you guys literally
nothing we can do it really can't this
is an impromptu stream for the 37th time
is it an oyster is there a way to change
that
we the only way to change the noise gate
is to stop the stream and start it again
it might be lets you know what fucking
that's what guys we're gonna stop the
stream and start it again
shit's getting crazy shits good great
look at here this is it mess it up your
things putting it in LA
oh my god hey that might have broken it
I didn't break nothin I said so much to
drink folks one beer everything's going
shit then one beer where's my noise gate
no gate noise gate yeah people are
saying I don't I don't even know how
this noise gate works how about that can
we nice gate automatically mutes the
inputs it not once it goes below the
clothes threshold of the gate okay so
there we go like here okay and when it
goes above the open threshold
what
fine
okay so we can go at the weight and I
don't use it when it goes above the open
threshold
okay
okay
I think I think I figured it out
okay how's this I think I figured out
the noise gate that once we figure out
the noise game we got to figure out the
spot pass oh why as if someone told me
what spot passes yet wait what
you
if you are you guys no you know what we
have to keep the noise gate on because
during the first couple of streams
you guys were complaining about a
humming noise that is the general room
tone
so everybody complains about everything
so this is what's happening let's be
pass spot pass detects hack frogs Oh No
okay but what does pop has really do
you're not gonna ever be sure I'm
assuming it's some kind of deer or
anything I don't think it's a drm thing
I'm gonna cancel I'm not gonna do stop s
okay okay you can be changed anything
great
what the who love what a plays Tony why
wouldn't the other characters be like
like peach and and Daisy yosy Yoshi here
Daisy or yosi obviously I meant Yoshi
don't don't be an asshole
why are you such an asshole because I'm
a middle child I think and so I see at
crave attention
okay select over yeah no you understand
but wait is this anything like you need
to have two for two players buddy plus
gamepad so it's like if it's just the
two of us okay
enjoy you guys were doing it did I just
do you I have no idea I think it's just
you I've no idea I have no idea what's
happening oh we should update the game
you
super my rose you so we're ships don't
have their faces well then that way they
know we're trying to get into oh oh oh
that's adorable
okay well I guess that makes sense why
peach isn't in it
yeah they couldn't have written that any
differently no no they're kind of locked
into that logic yes we're we absolutely
that makes perfect sense
oh my god so much plot can you skip this
baby skip cutscene stay drink
my owner was the reason this is the WiiU
right yeah
what's the we still in four by three and
then yeah the we was yeah we must was
even that long ago we was standard FA
was a long time ago
how long when did the way come out seven
years ago really we get some kind of
higher death no it wasn't sure high def
but there might have been like a wide
screen say maybe it was I want to say
its standard definitely and I think it
came out at least seven years ago huh is
this only one player I can do boost mode
I'm using the gamepad okay oh no family
rich is pretty bad at this game did you
try everything don't you
the game's way too easy let's get that
coin yeah they're going not oh wait wait
look what's this doesn't it start that
can't even touch it
oh good somebody joined yeah I'm trying
to oh it's not letting me join with the
gamepad dog I have to dine with Jim wake
me up and jump on my head
yeah I'm trying we saw each other we did
I knew I'm coming can you choose not to
go in I mean that'd be a deadly monster
man
you're talking about the game right
apparently you can't choose not to go oh
here fuckin goombah oh I got a horn what
does that do imma flanks oh I'm a flying
suit can do girls yeah but look what I
can do can you do something with this
flower this farce too weird to not be a
thing I can your can your goofy sir do
something I'm gonna I'm going to assume
that that is just background I think
it's just background looks like oh you
can you can stop a fire wait did we do a
double what bouncer we sure did and it
did extra extra groups so this is
basically a classic Mario and side
scroller yes with a new super mario
brothers you
well hey you jumped up on my gym I don't
like the little the singers in the
soundtrack though the little Bob Bob
well that's just the first thought I'm
very good used to it no I think oh well
you know this is just one of many things
over here get them before you can
there's like 10 million new super mario
brothers games and this is the first one
jaysene that's true but it is
oh I'm not seeing a Mario game in
probably a decade reach you know you can
do what I shake the Wiimote and we got
up oh that looks a lot better than the
flying suit like this yeah damn damn I'm
filled with joy I don't I don't like
them suits that make Mario look too
goofy though yeah I don't know
fireflower Mario's what is fancy is that
like Mario look kneeling the little
raccoon suits the meat you flying so I'm
not very more complicated than just the
ears and peddling weird cat suits spring
soon after if he looks like a fucking
penguin I hate ollege I like the frag
the frag suit
what's the Franks
oh why would you say it is like Fred
Fred Oh cuz that was being funny I said
Fred I said frog and it's like fake
saying things in a different way it
didn't work the countess is being funny
if nobody understands what you're doing

speak of the devil oh I lost them it's
okay he'll come back
Yoshi's gotta say though he seems less
special now that there's two identical
Yoshi's it should just be two dinosaurs
one can be Yoshi but they're both just
to the oh she's no he doesn't feel even
deeper interesting well he was always
kind of you know
well I went down the pipes Kim that's
probably sure you know what Yoshi wasn't
necessarily special and super my world
leader because there was a really album
was it I mean every time he died I knew
you Agri pop up that's what I remember
those I always think of Yoshi's the
green one even there were other colored
dinosaurs yeah but I mean like he would
kill Yoshi in that a New Year's you show
up yeah you die you come back to exactly
what I did you fire uh if you didn't if
you did enough jams
it doesn't really help you know because
I got Yoshi so I cannot set fire to your
face on fire
not being able to walk past each other
is actually a really upsetting no Yugi
no
flower power everything sucks
Dinah's over a gym oh hey
special pipe you're coming too nope
don't go down a different pipe get him
yeah we did something we got a coin and
we did something you shop
Oh Yoshi Yoshi I love you ah
Yoshi I'm sorry you keep getting hit
under my thumb with me
look at that you found a magical world
this not much of a war but okay but you
find it
oh it's a porch you found it why is Jack
so drunk tonight
here's the thing he's not I'm really not
he's just weird
drunk on Hawaii I'm a little
discombobulated it's been a long day and
so for anyone just joining a stream
rich and I were recording gameplay
footage for Mario Kart 8 oh my god we
have a friend now apparently Luke and I
were recording gameplay footage for
Mario Kart 8 earlier and my program
crashed and I think we have to keep them
alive
oh you hold on to him Oh
just start the level sorry tonight were
recording gameplay footage program
crashed
we lost oh shit that was a complete
accident
oh sorry we lost about two and a half
hours worth gameplay footage and it
really really made me feel bad and so
little extra goofy is just thinking
about some work we put in and that work
might not be for anything now
everything's terrible
I just died tell me you know this feels
good after you up your front of Mario
Kart bullshit dragon Mario Kart I am NOT
parently at this game look damn this for
me guys I'm
that's lost a grand total of one wife
Jack I don't think I am
terrible Jackie hack fraud it's very
true we are playing on a biggie no no no
first you have any control and this
reverses on me can you choose where to
go no that's just it
the question being asked in the stream
is why do we record hours of footage
when all you need is just rich going
yeah this is true you're absolutely
right we are gonna rethink how we do how
else how else is rich going to say and
unless we play the game
think about it like that how is he gonna
know whether or not to say out and I
know you're thinking our mind is made up
before we even play the games we tried
to make generally informed decisions
about the opinion
we gather oh I forgot that we had
firepower do you do isn't this isn't
this a world of difference from Sunday
oh my god right all the jumping seems to
make sense it's not random memorization
I haven't played this before
no no it's almost as if the levels were
designed around jumping around and
shooting enemies not not around you know
going fast arbitrarily and that's you
know let's be fair you know sonic is a
30 year old game sonic is a 20 year old
game so it couldn't get everything right
you know my brother's good and that's a
25 year old yes oh shit
oh also by the way stream we have
received at red letter media zero
handwritten resumes and I thought the
dam was going to be you guys sending in
resumes this is great I like this
getting showered with coins there's
extra guy who jams to I was told by the
stream that you are going to send in
resumes handwritten resumes and the best
resumes we would read live in the chat
and according how many Bowser's did you
accidentally hit apparently many Jesus
Christ jack according to sources at red
letter media zero resumes have been sent
in so what the fuck guys did you explain
the details of this because we don't
want serious resumes we really don't
we're not looking for help no they're
gonna think that now I have to be very
curb explanation many many times to
streams not everybody is in the stream
everything didn't hear the idea is to
send us joke resumes genuinely Sunday's
resume right he was very adamant about
news he was a little pushy a little put
a little pushy and so we thought it
would be funny if people the stream sent
us joke resumes to the P o box
handwritten of course they have to be
handwritten and the funniest resumes we
would leave we would read that live in
the stream and no one has sent in a
resume yet you guys are hacks also frogs
I'm sworn oh god you almost killed I
saved you you man no we're going to jump
off the jam I got I got jumping wheel
hey come here
oh you can stick them all oh that's
right you can jump up that forgot about
acorns am you know what I'm Florida your
flower I'm a fire flower okay that's I'm
gonna be okay with that okay
Oh save me save me a corn go boom whoa
but I can get this oh my god
well rich you got to watch out for me
I'm a wild card
no shit no shit what you knock me off
the thing what are you talking about I'm
Way over here
yeah I wasn't I ran out of room rich
Jack get your stuff I can try knocking
off the cliff oh I'm sorry I'm just here
getting jails could you come down here
get this I have my fire flower I'm not
all happy uh-huh
and then you knock me off at three times
I have no recollection of any of this oh
wait look how can you see this
oh no I'm a squirrel I was cool cat oh
my lord see what my wild card gets it
gets us treats
it got me anti treats well you didn't
need to stick around didn't stick around
for the damn Bowser's kids are in this
game yeah
Elaine most of the games now these days
the first one they were in is three
right yes
yeah then they made a cartoon series
boom which is much much better than the
captain boom oh my cartoon and then it's
almost embarrassing okay
oh my god
this is why rich doesn't like
multiplayer games when you have to
depend on someone else
uh-huh I do know a lot about Mario 3
that was the game I played that was the
the last of my video game playing who's
Mario 3
okay both will save files it's our play
a couple more worlds I'm gonna call it a
little later

tomorrow I love Sir James things one
things not not the whole sand stages
Slauson buzzin not world you're right
you're right you're right you're right

see orange yeah we called the safety
that particular thing Jan thank you to
Spain of reference I always police cop

bunch of stuff over the weekend yeah
that's all I have to say let's face
count that's P good we got good stuff
over the weekend we shot some good
scenes Jay please started discussions
you started a discussion yes tell me
what you want me to talk about I
probably won't help a brother out
get that fucking finger the killer of
Mojo Jojo Jojo maybe what Powerpuff
Girls come on stretch Oh thoughts on the
Mad Max trailer holy shit Oh God
I've watched that trailer like 20 times
no it looks great I'm so awesome it
looks really really great I have no idea
where your hype is coming from have you
seen the other Mad Max movies of course
okay so you've seen them and you see
this new one which looks like it's the
same director uh-huh it's got the same
weird-ass S&M; future costumes and stuff
yeah
it's got practical car effects how could
you not be excited
it's got Mad Max stepping on a lizard
put two headed lizard oh yeah I gotta
say the only Mad Max way that I really
love is the second one is road warrior
oh really big fan I left the first half
of thunder know always once he leaves
Bartertown and he teams up with all
those little kids I kind of lose
interest come on thunder don't was the
redemption of his character I suppose
yeah no it's I like them all but the
only one I really love his a road
warrior but I I love the look of this
new one Shirley's dioramas character
looks badass she's got a robot arm
that's built out of junk I didn't notice
that yeah if you look at her arm like
one of the things that's holding the arm
together is like a wrench that's welded
onto it it looks really right yeah I'm
super excited I've watched that trailer
many many times now I don't know maybe
it's maybe it's so maybe it's we make
sequel fatigue we're even well here's
the thing though this is my god like a
studio just rebooting a popular game
very objective this is George Miller who
directed the original three he's been
trying to make this movie for years
right you couldn't get money to do it
just started shooting they ran out of
money or something like that they set
all sorts of problems this is a passion
project so today we're gonna do an
animated version yeah I don't know I
guess that's what I'm saying is like I'm
not putting in two suspects how good the
movie would will be or the intentions of
competing but it's just general sequel
fatigue just this is another thing that
I've seen before exactly okay I guess I
can understand that but it looks badass
and that's all there is you know what I
really dug is the way that the the score
was edited car effects like it was all
like instead of instead of blah yeah it
was a higher to them
you know it was all the the crunchy car
effects I really dug the sound of it now
what's happening there's a little purple
guy that ran into the world we just went
into one let's go fuck him up what's the
I'm doing it to fuck him up I waiting
for long let's go fuck that guy up how
do we OH
I guess we use a cannon to go back to
the other world
let's do that let's go fuck that purple
guy who the fuck does he think he is
being a purple stone shit fucking oh is
that what he did fuck that guy
I haven't no I someone who decides about
the movie snowpiercer I have not seen
that many many people have been
recommending that movie to us I still
haven't had a chance to see it
George Miller being the first director
to return things on where he created we
do a good job maybe who knows let's have
to be seen with the trailers promising
but then again the trailer for
Prometheus is promise Isaac this here's
the upsetting part about this which came
up which came up first this or Rayman
Origins huh this is actually a less fun
version of Rayman Origins really yes
Rayman Origins is a brilliant platformer
that every once in a while has little
levels where you have to chase someone
so if this came out after Rayman Origins
I'm gonna go ahead and call shenanigans
I don't know people the people in the
chat nobody own user not you do Mario
it's been on since the DS right
you know versions of this I don't know
if they all have the chasing I think
though we version might trying to
remember anyone else no shenanigans on
this or shenanigans on Raymond did it
great Rayman Origins is a super great
platformer though the Wonder Woman
costume can we talk about the amazing Oh
new Wonder Woman cuz you know what the
fuck they're doing no they do know what
they're doing it's just that what
they're doing is completely stupid
they're doing Zack Snyder yeah you know
what I won the Wonder Woman costume
albrow ain't completely Brown oh no it
is slightly different shades of brown so
you can see her who's the actress
playing Wonder Woman not even ever that
is someone people like look I that makes
any sense yeah I know people were
excited about I mean I guess I can't I
don't know who I don't recognize her but
I'm not gonna fall to her I just think
the costume is so boring
well isn't it really even the Superman
costume has a little bit
it's all muted it's it's all dark and
heated but it's still something the
soffit is just completely brown lights I
think you can feed it yeah no let's
thought that Zack Snyder's whole world
is if it's if it's if it's brown it's
pretty realistic you know I rewatched
the Christopher Nolan Batman movies
recently yeah and I know that's kind of
what started the whole gritty realistic
superhero thing but those movies still
have levity to them and then a story
like it's not I just think a Man of
Steel now and how like ugly and old that
movie was well no one has a director
generally I really dislike Zack Snyder
now I do I don't think that man has
original vision he else things because
he thinks it looks cool yeah yeah that's
what I learned from the commentary track
for Watchmen I think it was every
creative decision he made was because he
thought it looked cool I will say it the
first 10 minutes or so that his Dawn of
the Dead remake awesome you know that
opening sequence like like the
newscaster like the world-building
sequence is great yeah yeah all the
stuff before the actual story starts and
I like the movie overall not kind of
like watch me too but after that no I
haven't seen anything Zack Snyder's done
that I've like oh oh you know what are
you talking about like the little girl
sequence yeah the whole opening and then
she runs outside and her the shoe
suburban neighborhood is you know one
fire and yeah people are freaking out
and driving away and hitting other
people with cars like it's wonderful
that whole opening ten minutes the chaos
of it is so well done all right I can be
done with that
yeah I can go as far as that anything
else in that movie is bullshit garbage
I've really disliked it yeah and then
you know the story we wrote that movie
that was James Gunn now everybody loves
because it varies the gouging bullshit
movie and it's made extra bullshit
because I remember I got the DVD
her - she bumped into each other stopped
over I was renting the DVD of the Dawn
of the Dead and he had a special little
director's intro would you address the
audience directly he said this is the
director's cut of the movie and this is
a much more personal cut excited that I
get to share my vision of the movie and
the only difference between the
director's cut in theatrical release was
like two minutes of sexiness okay and I
saw I know it's not restraining her so I
guess I learned that Zack Snyder Justice
League movies gonna be some bunk ass
shit calling it guys and I'm gonna be
dressed in brown yep every costume will
be brown it's gonna be raining the whole
time and everybody's gonna fuck
everything
I don't understand what it is well you
know I do understand yeah you can simply
yeah I understand exactly what motivates
man was Batman made a bunch of money
yeah but Wonder Woman and Superman are
not Batman nor should they be doesn't
matter you know has to look the same I
don't care about that Batman made a
bunch of money yes superheroes needs to
be like Batman and they're too deep into
production after Avengers made money to
switch gears yeah once once Avengers
made money and there's like oh your
superheroes can't be colorful and things
can be fun there were too deep into
production I don't even think that
matters I think it's just a Man of Steel
made a shitload of money
so now however every now we well in
Manistee Oh was of course inspired by it
the Nolan Batman babies so it's like
everything has to be like that no
everything has to be dour everything has
to be ugly and gray and brown and that's
just what we're gonna ride it bothers me
on a very real level that Man of Steel
may be good father it's sort of
astounding isn't it because that movie
is awful because like even transformers
explosions yeah and that's why it's
mindless and it's it's dumb and it's
flawed in so many ways but splosions I
can understand your your pain to see
robots fight each other yeah I i'd be
more upset if they weren't also making
right now
like guardians of the galaxy there there
is hope there's sure there's hope but I
would like a good Superman movie well
they made one in 1978 that's true that's
a good Superman boy yeah and there's
always you know there's the Superman
cartoon there's the old Justice League
cartoon which is fun oh all I need are
the Batman Returns Batman the Animated
Series that's all I need Jack's that is
the definitive Batman in my life
absolutely 100% absence yeah I've never
seen it I don't know if it was just the
intro title sequence all if the entire
thing but they animated with black cells
usually when you animate you use clear
cells oh sure but they animated with
black cells and painted over just to
make sure that everything was dark could
be wrong I thought I heard they almost
got in trouble for being like too dark
for television know that Batman they are
men the animated series was the only
instance in which Batman was ever a
detective yeah yeah that show is badness
he spent time and figured things out it
was great I think it's a really good
place ending ok and just just the voice
work Kevin Conroy
fucking awful yes he's a good reason
Wayne fucking awful he's a good root
that man's the important Clark Oh
Christian Bale can play a rich white guy
he's just yeah I'm just gonna flat out
see it was fucking awful whose whose
idea was the voice I got idols was a
geek is an actor twice or no I don't
care as an act
raishin of sentenced a man I believe it
was his choice because and Christopher
Nolan was just like sure do it I think I
believe his motivation was Batman was
like them and this is I believe I'm
remembering like an interview of his and
he said that Batman was like the monster
or the demon inside of him and so that
was his monster for me but it's not a
great movie because of Batman and Batman
is like the least interesting character
in all of those movies that is in all of
those movies that isn't all of those
movies that is in all of those movies
that isn't all
