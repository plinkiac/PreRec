[Part I]
hello hello testing am I too loud I
don't know I don't see anybody in the
chat talking right now
no there's couple people earlier but I
don't know I don't know what happened
yep I don't know what happened yeah it's
just weird issues on on my end or what
but I'm streaming now I'm gonna do a no
death run on dead rising I know how it's
gonna work
poorly probably gonna be a long stream
hopefully or terribly short one dadly
should stream cuz I'm starting from
level 1 we're doing this the hard way
goddammit that's just how I roll
crap in my way
hello everyone how you doing how you
doing um alright the way I view this
stream this is kind of an extra I am
going to seriously try to no death run
this game and get the best possible
ending if I fuck up I'm gonna keep going
but I'm going for the best possible
ending to this game and I might be
paying more attention to the game than I
am the the chat and and whatnot the
reason is I just I just felt like
playing this game felt like playing this
game right so I'm not going to select a
device so that I can start at level 1
start game 72-hour mode
all right now cutscene which we all know
I'm not going to skip I'm just I'm just
not going to do it
let's enjoy let's enjoy the Wonder
everybody Shh
how's the audio on everything
hey buddy
you mentioned something about research
for a story that's right got a tip that
something bigs happening in a nowhere
little town like that they sure didn't
mention anything about it on TV
yeah well I'm freelance pal I don't make
my living waiting for the TV to tell me
what to cover
here she is William at Colorado
population 53,000 594 distinguishing
characteristics jack-shit about the only
thing to do in this town is kill time at
the shopping mall
what was that the army
looks like taking the helicopter was the
way to go I bet they got all the roads
blocked off by now all right listen okay
you know I'm not talking cutscene with a
sellout of you and point him I'm sure
let me get in here they go the beginning
during the stream so this
you know you get an achievement for
killing 54,000 zombies
alright I'm gonna have to switch the
inverted settings obviously you start
off in the helicopter here Frank West
has no idea there are zombies I'm
something most people know this game but
I don't I don't know okay for the record
here I am starting from scratch the
beginning of the game I did not tell it
to use any any of my hard hard drive
type things so it there's that I have no
I don't even have the ability to save
right now and I'm going to start off at
level 1
so I'm actually going to be trying to
use the photography to level up as much
as I can
and honest I'm trying to time the photo
taking to the dramatic moments 20 hits
him with the bat or two when he's
waiting for help because you'll get
you'll get more points to level up
faster
I did not forget to tweet that I was
streaming I don't know much about the
tweets I asked Jack to tweet it out for
me maybe he forgot I don't know
maybe you forgot
yes this is oh I like that sense of
humor it's dark yes this is Baltimore
right now you know you know the creepy
part about that School Bus cuz the
zombies are around it you just know
there are children in that bus I
definitely have to de invert the
controls I guess my xbox Xbox is now set
to automatically invert when I have
myself so I've I've got it
flip that god damn it oh it's terrible
that's terrible I was fighting with the
camera and I missed the explosion missed
a decent amount of points
yeah I was earlier today I was I was
here listening to the radio on mob the
Chicago White Sox are with know that
we're supposed to play the Baltimore
Orioles today and that's why when I
heard about the riots like you know
they're talking about not canceling the
game even though there was a riot going
on
I got 39 points for that picture that's
terrible that's terrible
that's the intro of the game this is
what Jack skipped when he was streaming
cuz he's in he's an impatient game
good shot not bad not bad
and
a little bit too early I'm gonna got
more points I think they were good fault
damn it
I want to see the center of town okay
oh six I got six
Hey
can you get me on the rooftop of that
mall
you gotta be kidding me man you are nuts
all right listen don't forget to come
back for me as long as you're not dead
Fred its Frank Frank West cracker man 5
to 6 thank you for subscribing we really
appreciate it
Jay's manhole thank you for subscribing
we really appreciate it
we really do I'm going okay here's
here's the rules okay I just was like an
impromptu stream just because I felt
like playing Dead Rising it's gonna be a
no death-room I am not using any
previous save so I am starting from
level 1 I don't think I'm going to be
able to pull off a perfect run but I'm
going to try and do as well as I can I'm
going to try to follow the story at
story I'm going to try and save as many
people as I can
there will probably be deaths
I just fucking know that that little
bitch Aaron swoop is gonna die because
he sucks and I'm not gonna have enough
health to go back and save his ass
constantly so he might die he's probably
gonna be the first survivor that dies on
me but we'll see we'll see
I doubt the military would quarantine
the entire yeah yeah yes yes favorite
customer I could just stay on the roof
for 72 hours but that's hardly any fun I
I have played Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising
2 is pretty fun I think I like one
better I mean the combo weapons and two
are nice but two is just too fucking
easy the survivor AI is actually too
good
I think you save them and you just run
to the safehouse and there's no
challenge to it at all they they go
really easy with you and two unlike the
timing on things it's it's not too hard
to do everything I think I think my
first time through Dead Rising 2 was a
perfect run and that should not happen
that she just not happen it wasn't a no
death perfect run my first time through
Dead Rising 2 was a perfect run and it
wasn't much of a challenge 3 I haven't
played at all
yes this is the game that Jack was
playing the other day and the law I am
going to play it for real not that he
wasn't really playing it but I mean I'm
going to try and accomplish goals in the
game I'm not gonna just be fucking
around here we go
I know you get an achievement for taking
a snapshot of all of the survivors and
whatnot I don't I don't know if that
translates to anything in-game
oh I know I switch off the inversion
here because I've deflect myself
car leadership
I don't I don't hate achievements I'm
just I mean I mean I do hate
achievements I'm just the reason I'm
worried about is I'm not sure if you get
do get prestige points for it because I
care about how it levels me up in the
game like like I know you get a stupid
achievement for taking picture of X
number of survivors but does that does
that also translate into in in in game
leveling because that's that's what I'm
concerned with because I'm starting at
level 1
I want to level myself as quickly as I
can is any anything that's going to get
me those prestige points I'm gonna be
trying to do
because I don't know if you ever won
Jack play I mean he was he was sitting
around because he was playing on my file
that's that was just fully leveled he
was at level 50 I'm at level 1 and of
course I won't skip the cutscenes
your guy runs Frick rust West runs like
he has a dump in his pants because he
jumped out of a helicopter because he's
kind of an idiot
he's he's running with a limp rich will
you act done got Lee says rich we
actually go through the whole 72 hours
if you don't die well it's not it's like
it's like Grand Theft Auto we're hours
are a lot faster I want to say every day
is like two hours roughly I think I
think story mode is like six hours so I
mean if things go if things go right I'm
gonna be here for at least six hours
which when you take pictures does it
take into consideration composition I
believe the more centered you are the
better it is whatever is going on with
us I have a violent act I think you get
more points if it's centered so I think
to some degree as much as much as a
computer can judge composition I think
they I think they do yes Frank West is
the main character's name Thank You dick
neutral I didn't I didn't think to
explain that people have been paying
attention six hours stream hype unless I
die this is a true no death run now if I
die this stream just ends I don't care
how long it's been if it's been half an
hour and I die stream ends ten minutes I
die stream ends I go I go five hours
maybe I'm almost there and I die stream
ends
time to take some pictures you see that
thing in the bottom says PP 53 percent
that's prestige point so there's
something that wants me to line the
camera op on and if I get it centered
right I will get more points for that
picture 44 60 80 80 s fine fuck it
and I'm gonna try and take pictures of
everybody who's still alive just because
I think I might get prestige points
where'd she go where'd she go wow they
are just too damn short
I get all three
now
just then but I give you something
another deal you only got like
portraiture achievement unlocked but I
don't think I don't think I got prestige
points for that
which kind of sad kind of sad
you stop right there do you have any
idea what you've done
why did you summon me to this place what
are you planning do calm down I don't
even know what you're talking about
so a particular director I would like to
see make a a Batman movie not in
particular look as much as much as I've
complained about Christian Bale and his
take on Batman and that stupid voice the
Dark Knight's probably as good of a
Batman movie it should get at least
anytime soon
dr. mayonnaise you're welcome you're
welcome I'm glad to do this impromptu
stream I was like he's planning on doing
this anyway why not why not stream it
why not
all right
yes I don't want all this information
now I know there is a shotgun pop here
that's kind of hard to get oh no no I'm
no unwholesome early-game low on health
I want to go fix ships here long I want
to get the shotgun get that shotgun get
that shot I'm so used to being a tank
I'm so used to being a tank cuz I'm
gonna I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up
got it got it get out get out get out
we're all right just a life and I got
the shotgun
time to farm
oh that's nice
that's nice that's nice
oh they're all stuck on the railing none
of them can get to me I'm just gonna
take pictures and level my ass up
Selena
fantastic
level up all right
yeah yeah love love I get it I get it
that's great
fantastic
you get more points than eating people
is that okay yes this is grinding but I
am going for a no death run all right I
need I need to I need to level up a
little bit as quickly as I can
there's strategy and this this is
strategizing and while I hate grinding I
never said I wouldn't do it if I felt
like I had to I just usually don't like
it when I kind of feel like I have to
one more I'll save some photos all right
all right
head to the stairs head into the stairs
which talk about Jurassic world Smurfs I
think I think I said it all last night
the first Jurassic Park respected the
the science of dinosaurs I mean there
were there were new wild ideas of
paleontology at the time and Jurassic
Park embraced them and Jurassic worms
just doesn't give a shit it wants to
make a hybrid dinosaur monster oh and
you know you know the reason they're
making a hybrid Tyrannosaurus right it's
gonna be like part human for no good
reason it's it's super intelligent it
has a human brain and and the reason
they're doing a hybrid dinosaur as the
big monster in Jurassic world is because
they can't stop other toy makers from
making Tyrannosaurus Rex toys but if
they make their own special dinosaur
they can copyright it movies just
bullshit that's all right that's all I
have to say about Jurassic world those
things are smart enough to use the ducks
so they won't you want to get back in
there what for
Hey
nice camera are you a photographer as a
matter of fact I am Frank West
photojournalist could you show me some
pictures Frank
which if I seen any film or TV series
that I wouldn't recommend lately look as
much as I had issues with the kingpin in
daredevil I do recommend daredevil I
mean it's a great show I just I just had
issues with it which isn't the same
thing as my having hated it so I I would
recommend daredevil am i excited that
spider-man is back in marvel's hands I
am ambivalent until I see what they did
with him
all right
I've wasted a lot of time taking
pictures there's there's some things I
want to get done before nightfall in the
game before the convict show up God
got me a baseball bat
it's rescue your ass
this is the one of the first games they
made with HDTVs in mind and I remember
trying to play this on standard def and
you you you couldn't read any of the
fucking text it was just way too small
for standard deaf
mr.
come on hurry up Jeff fuckin old fuck
right should've got 10,000 for that it's
a little bit off a little bit off say I
wasn't my composition wasn't as good as
it needed to be
the question is do I want to so I'm
gonna say abuse the the chainsaws the
mini chainsaws III know I'm going for a
no death run but those almost make the B
game unfun
I'm taking a picture of this thing for a
reason we'll come into use later
save that alright
see I'm thinking ahead I'm strategizing
I tell you why but I guess it's a
spoiler
yeah
alright I'll just get here get your
message out of the way notice kind of
sucks
shut up Otis shut up shut up
I don't care
hey what the fuck is happening well
we're doing a no death run on Dead
Rising starting from complete scratch
the rules are I'm starting from level
one gonna try and get the best ending
possible and rescue as many people as I
can
don't think I'm gonna be able to rescue
all of them especially not starting out
at level one so stream ends when I die
so if I fuck up on a psychopath that's
it any plans to stream Dead Rising 2
well not tonight
but I I wouldn't be against I do like
Dead Rising one more but I don't hate
Dead Rising 2

inventory slots right now

if making oh god I gotta try and beat
Cletus no that's suicide
that's just suicide
all right
your girlfriend sent me to find you
Jesse damn it
okay we'll have to talk about this later
you know how to use that gun I've never
fired at a person all right I'll cover
you from here you need to stick to the
shadows try to get close to the target
okay and what am I supposed to do when I
get close well the best solution would
be to shoot the guy but if you can't do
that keep him busy dodging your bullets
and stay out of trouble are you up to it
I'm a lot better with a camera but yeah
I'll give it a shot
all right next time you reloads I'll lay
down a suppressing fire I'm counting on
you make your way over there one
two three yeah so many in the chat said
this is one of the first games to make
them need a 360 and I would agree with
that I
I got a 360 in the large part because of
this game
while the lamer boss encounters of this
game
and none of none of the bosses in this
game is some kind of ridiculous super
zombie I mean the zombies are just like
straight-up Romero zombies it's it's
kind of great the bosses are all normal
human beings or either just kind of evil
or who have lost their mind because
zombies
boom headshot
damnit
we're yet Brad got him away --bread oh
fuck off ah fucking grenades look I
gotta save those dicks in the shop
before nightfall
alright I don't have time to fuck around
with you all night
are you stuck on steak that way too much
time
that wasn't gonna work I just I just I
feel the clock you know
I can't tell you how much I hate aiming
with a controller god dammit
Oh God open throw the box and open the
box
all right Aaron swoop was gonna die
because I can't be Carlito in time
course
thank God
it shoot him until he dies yeah easy
easy unless he's throwing grenades at
you that took way too long don't say
good job that took way too long so a lot
of shit I want to get done before
nightfall but I'm not gonna be able to
get done now thanks for your help
my name's Brad I'm Frank West and right
now I'd rather have an explanation than
you thanks Brad
sorry I've got nothing to tell you
look
I don't know what Jesse told you
but as far as I'm concerned we're
through working together so you cover
your zombie story and leave the rest to
us
you uh you guys are looking for someone
here alright yeah
who is that where did you help me I help
you
damn
you're one hell of a journalist aren't
you Frank
a hot-headed underhanded hotshot
paparazzi with nothing better to do than
to invade people's privacy I try you got
a point
you win franca
let's work together
Jesse and I are DHS agents and yes we
are looking for the man in that picture
you're with Homeland Security is that
guy a terrorist or something
I took that picture in the entrance
Plaza
right near the front door
the entrance Plaza you're sure
hey so do I have your permission to
cover this story or not
all right
yeah yes I got a level jump kicks a good
one
so there's that Brad don't waste time
shooting other zombies just run past
them like same no we need to get to the
door and we need to do it fast
but I lose the guitar
oh shit the spread
I just wanted to do that for fun and
Rael means real thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
I think broke just perfect timing
although I ate Donuts
oh it's time for snacks
sir if you could just kindly come with
us we can wrap this whole thing up no
I'm not leaving until you can guarantee
me safe passage us to open these gates
just open this gate off for your
protection what you can't just arrest
him he turned down my offer to protect
him said he isn't going anywhere until I
can guarantee you secure Michael 87 you
think in real life the best anti zombie
defense is a suit of medieval armor the
direct line to HQ no we need to do know
for one those things have to be
exhausting to use and the one oh god the
one thing you don't want to do in the
middle of a horde of zombies is to run
out of energy and to be get exhausted
they've as some B's already have the the
advantage when it comes to endurance
wearing a heavy suit of armor is just
gonna increase it like tenfold and when
you're when you're surrounded by like a
hundred zombies you're not gonna be able
to fight your way out of that you're
just feel like a tin can they're gonna
be they're gonna be poking at until you
either till they either find a way
through or you starve to death smothered
and smothered and zombies trying to get
through your suit
if you people if anybody any of you are
at all interested in zombies and you you
haven't read it I highly recommend the
Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks he
read zombie defense you're now rather
than a a medieval suit of armor you're
better off with like a shark suit it's
been faster so I get the points for
spinning
it's like it I'll come back here later
to get points
actually no way to suspect yes
nailing his peasants useless
that's useless not to actually
doo-doo-doo-doo
I'll get you back
my favorite bit of advice from the
Zombie Survival Guide though it wouldn't
be a great long-term solution is to
destroy your staircase if you if you
live on the second floor or have a home
with a second floor destroy your
staircase zombies will never be able to
get up of course food will be an issue
at some point come on come on get your
designated spot and notice the zombies
even though you're already noted the
zombies
okay take that shotgun you know you're
good with a shotgun I know you're good
for a bill
no Jason I got so much time to get the
Kent to fucking
you know what this game is great it's
great because it's not easy if you want
to do everything in this game
you have to work for it
come on

hohoho don't get stuck up there why'd
you come up here follow me everywhere
show me the shotgun skills I know you

inventory space here motherfucker
alright that's fine and get to this gun
store anytime now that's the important
thing
anybody else want to kick to the fucking
face Negus want some shotguns
alright save all what's-his-face
mean and plentiful oh this is not the
one he was in
no fucking sock doesn't waste oh you
know I'm big dumb
I want to do that is
there we go I think yep
yeah you sombitch
you know the easiest survivors to escort
are usually the ones with the hobbled
leg anyone that basically takes your
hand or that you can carry because you
can just run them right to where they
need to go
now what I don't remember is if there's
somebody I'm missing save lies one of
those one of those survivors who doesn't
show up as a mission they just there's
there
see it's easy it's easy you just run
through the store with him it's great
it's great I love it
I'm going to escort this man to the
bathroom and everything will be fine
and actually it's actually close to time
for the next mission
well where did you go conman
get on the Charlie
think I'm in general I'm behind schedule
but this there's usually some time to
kill on this first night anyway I'm just
I'm just gonna end up not having time to
fuck around by the time the next the
next missions ready to go I want to
disembowel move when does that unlock
disembowel is fun disembowel the the
head splat one
I am I'm pretty sure that so far
everybody who can be saved is saved
come on
over there
get up here you son of a bitch there we
go all right thanks
our secret cutscene than I'm missing
yeah I know there's like a scene where
Brad walks in with supplies and it's not
story necessary just if you walk in at a
certain point it happens I think I
missed it but it's not a big deal
yeah whatever
time is it that's gonna pop up in
No
a few minutes really I can't I can't do
much before the next mission starts I
got none of the wacky clothes unlocked
cuz like I said this is a completely
completely fresh character III when I
started this game I I didn't tell it to
use any hard drive so basically I can't
even save if I if I wanted to right now
it's almost it's almost date day twos
getting getting ready to begin looks
like I got some spare inventory slots
everything's coming up millhouse
but when I get early a start as I can on
that
next missions I'm gonna hang out around
I'm gonna hang around out here - my
watch says that's active
have I tried going for seven-day
survivor I've done it but I think I
think I had to get like a new hard drive
after I've done it so I don't think I'd
currently have the the ultra they're the
real mega buster
the real mega man mega buster unlocked
anymore I know one point I had 7 a
survivor though but I'm pretty sure that
the hard drive that was on went bad all
right
you should start time
I know I know I got the Mega Man suit
unlocked I know uh I don't know it was
before the last uprising stream I
might've been before the last dead
rising stream where I when I was showing
Jack the game of us I was running around
with the Mega Man suit so I definitely
know that's unlocked anyway before this
whole thing started someone called the
professor and told him to come to this
mall Jack the line did you
so was this the caller this guy here
they've got something to do with the
zombies don't they
they're the reason we came here
and if he gets away with dr. Barnaby
none of our questions will be answered
all right so this thing the mega
Buster's for the zombie genocide er okay
well um then I did I did have the the
Mega Buster online I did have the like
the real lightsaber unlocked I had I did
do it and you can't you can't no sword
surge Drive has been selected I know yes
and save game process I did not ask you
yes I want to continue applying I can't
even say of course I want to continue
why are you asking me these things
Thank You Otis thank you shut up this
fucking office
nobody likes Otis nobody likes you Otis
Otis shut up
Otis I grabbed some orange juice before
I go that that case it's definitely
gonna grab some orange juice first
look I know the ladies like me but I
don't got the time I don't got the time
lady no got fun all fine ladies want to
eat me
I need you know my chainsaw is almost
dead anyway
well no that's stupid they drop the site
all right away we go to our next
adventure adventure of adventure
whatever it is we're off to it
the chainsaw need repairs but you can't
fix it you just have to find a new one
but every every every item in this game
has like it'll break sooner or later
with use the more you use it the more
it's got like its own stand about meter
kind of thing stamina animal whatever
you know
Pachamama
but there are books you can pick up like
like right now I have the criminology
book which makes any bladed weapon last
three times as long there's three
different books that affect the chainsaw
and they stack I'm sure I don't want to
do that I mean that it basically it
feels like cheating I mean the fun of
this game comes from picking up the
things that are around you when using
them you know just picking up whatever
to use as a makeshift weapon but just
taking the most powerful weapon in the
game and and stacking the the books so
that it almost never breaks it feels
like cheating I don't want to do that
Carthon don't oh my god let's do two
damage that's not good it's not good
starting to think my stance on a musical
chainsaws
you'll uphill uphill up Frank get out of
here
nope nope nope
nope nope
do or die no fuck
I tried I tried
fucking fucking bread fucking bread
well
I'm glad you could join me on my special
bonus stream of Dead Rising yes this was
a AAA know death run and the death ends
the stream that's that's what this was
that's what this was I I had a decent
and then a half decent run half decent
running I'm not gonna save anyway I got
a I got a save with a fully fully
leveled up Frank I'm not saving this
favor if I ever want to do a no death
run again I'm not gonna want to do it
from here I'm gonna want to do it from
scratch so yeah all right everyone
thank you thank you for showing up very
much appreciated very much appreciated
